	My dear Cousin - </p>
	<p>  </p>
	<p>
	Your good letter of Oct. 12 came just in time for our anniversary and was very much enjoyed - also the enclosures.</p>
	<p>
	Yes, indeed I can tell you who the small photo is.  It is my own dear mother, Hannah Edwards Hoxie, sister of your grandmother, Althea Edwards Wright.  It is very good of her as she looked when it was taken, about 1874 I should think.  Do you notice her hair!  So very curly - No amount of brushing or wetting would keep it straight ten minutes.  The back hair she always wore in a French twist and the front as you see it.  She was a very bright cheerful woman, but her later years were saddened by father's death.  My brother and his his family went to live with her on the farm for a few years.  The last four years of her life she spent with me.  We tried to make her happy.  I think it was never like her own Roberts Meadow house to her but she never complained.  She left us in the fall of 1889.  The picture of your house is very attractive with its flowers and the big tree that you raised from the nut.  Your great aunt Hannah was very fond of flowers.  The picture you have of Ned and his son James is very good.  All his life Ned wore the heavy beard and kept most of his heavy head of hair.  He died thirteen yeart ago.  I have very few family friends left and my husband is the last of his large family of brothers and sisters.  But our son Philip and his family of three daughters, and one son lives in an apartment of our house, and are constantly looking after our welfare.  The grand children are all grown up.  Catharine the eldest is married, has a baby six months old.  I'm glad you have brothers and sisters and their families to give you an interest in life outside of your own family.  I am very glad to see the little baby dress on your daughter Blanche and which belonged to your Uncle Horace.  I saw him once when I was a small girl.  His family were then living in Cortland N.Y. (I think) not far from Syracuse.  Your grandmother died and my mother took me with her when she went to attend the funeral services.  We staid a few days.  When we left, Cousin Horace took us to the train and when he said good bye he left an enormous orange in my lap, and that is all I recall of him.  Of your mother at that time I remember very little but a good many years later she visited* her Eastern friends and I still recall the pleasure it gave "Aunt Hannah" to see her and hear of all the family.  I'm wondering if the lace on the baby dress is hand knitted.  Blanche was a pretty baby.  Is she the daughter who lives nearest you?  It was sad that your oldest son should be taken from his family of six children.  We cant understand the ways of Providence - can only trust in Him that all is for the best - Is the house of the picture still your home?  It looks comfortable and attractive as if someone who loves flowers lives there.</p>

	I never knew much about your Wright relatives.  I think they had nearly all left Easthampton before I grew up.  Your grandfather Wright is the only one I ever was well acquainted with.  I used to write to him occasionally and his letters in reply were very interesting.</p>
	<p>
	I think I must leave the rest till another time for my head is getting a bit tired.  It has a trick of being a bit confused at times, and I'm afraid of getting things mixed up.  You see what it means to be eighty six years old.  It was delightful to receive the anniversary card from you.  (I dont see what has got into my pen) - very many thanks for it.  I am returning the baby dress and photo of my mother but have no envelope that will take in the house.  Will send that another time.  Glad that you sent them.</p>

	Love and good wishes,</p>
