	Dear Lucy,</p>
	<p>  </p>
	<p>
	I will write you a few lines to go with the cards.  It is a bright  sunshiny day 22 below zero this morning.  Father and I are pretty well housed up.  There is a foot or more of snow which makes good sleighing.  But I would'ent care to try it.  It's more comfortable by the warm fire.  We are having considerable cloudy stormy weather.  We welcome a sunshiny day.  They are so scarce.  </p>
	<p>
	You will be surprised when I tell you that John & family have moved to Spokan Wash.  They got there the sixth of Dec.  A card tells no particulars yet.  John went with a carm took a team, cow, chickens, farm machinery and house hold stuff.  They sold thare home last year.  I am glad they have gone where it is'ent so cold.  Mary said they most froze in going to Mandan to take the train.  28 mi., she hoped they could settle where they would be nearer town.</p>
	<p>
	I suppose Harry & Alice are at Jeddo by this time where Harry's home is.  They expected to start from ________ Co the first of Dec., driving there with there horses & wagon.  Alice said they wouldent stay there if she and Elbert was'ent well but would sell and go where it was healthy.  I am glad that you dont have be moving.  Anyone can enjoy life so much better.  Well, I must bring this to a close.  Wishing you all a Mery Christmas and a happy New Year.</p>
