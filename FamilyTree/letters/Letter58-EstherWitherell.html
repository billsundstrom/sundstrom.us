	My dear Lucy,</p>
	<p>  </p>
	<p>
	I have neglected writing to you too long perhaps but I hope you have a forgiving disposition.  I've thought of you many times but as I get older small things grow larger and much that I ought to do remains undone.  Also my eyesight isn't as good as it used to be, and I dont like to use my eyes in the evening which has been my time for writing letters.  Many thanks for the map you sent.  It gives me a little idea of your location.  How long have you lived in California?  You are not far from Monrovia, I judge, where a friend of ours spent last winter.  She came home wearing an engagement ring, and expects that to be her future home.  She is quite enthusiastic about the place and the people.  I've always been interested in California.  My father spent two years there, when I was quite young, for his health.  He came home hoping to take the family back with him, but mother couldn't quite consent so he staid with us and with much better health than before.  He never lost his liking for Calif.  I'm wondering what the weather is with you today.  It is rainy and cold here.  In fact we have had a cold, rainy disagreeable spring.  Much more so than usual.  We have a small garden which my husband always plants early.  This time it was much too cold and things are only just beginning to grow.  But the weather will straighten out later, and so I hope will the depression in business which has been with us so long.  As a family we cannot complain but the young people are somewhat uneasy.  Catharine is happily married.  Julia is to be married in the early fall.  The two younger ones can wait a little.  From the picture you sent I judge the little country church must be in a delightful location but that cant wholly account for its popularity.  The preacher must be a remarkable man.  An audience of 2000 in our church would be very unusual.  My husband and I are both quite deaf.  I am quite lame; have been so for several years.  Mr Witherell has a slight weakness of the heart which causes some trouble.  So we decided we must give up a constant attendance at church.  In fact we are not often far away from home at any time, but we dont forget the church; are not entirely forgotten by the church people.  I hope all is well with your family.  Does your sister Alice live with you?  I hope you are not alone in your home.  (But I think you have written that a daughter is at home with you.)  You see I'm quite forgetful.  But I have kept your letters and will refer to them.  I wish I could tell you more about your family friends, but I never knew any but your own immediate family.  Your Aunt Celia, I think that was her name, used to be with us quite a good deal when I was small.  I distinctly remember a visit she made us after she had lived in Honolulu some years.  She had a little girl with her who, years afterward, came to this country to complete her education.  She married here.  I wonder if you know anything about her or about other of her, Celia's, children. </p>

	Perhaps I'd better say goodbye.  It is getting cool here and I must turn on the heat a little more.</p>

	Much love,</p>

	Please forgive the blot.</p>
