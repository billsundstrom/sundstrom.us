	My dear Lucy,</p>
	<p>  </p>
	<p>
	Your letter says Dec. 13, '34.  I'm sorry to have delayed replying quite so long.  I enjoy getting a little bit in touch again with your family.  Your letters are interesting.  How different your life in winter from ours.  We have had severe cold and heavy snow storms but the weather is moderating now.  Some little patches of snow still linger and it will be several weeks before my husband can begin work in his little patch of garden.  And you are raising all sorts of things all through the year I suppose.  But now-a-days we can buy at the market, in winter, vegetables as fresh as those we raise in our own garden.  How they get them here I cant imagine.  Cold storage keeps them I suppose.  A day or two ago we had some peas that were just as good as we raise in our own garden in summer, and the price is not exorbitant.  We have no orange trees, no flowers in bloom out of doors.  But you have no coasting, no skating on ice, no snow shoeing.  (How will you swap?)  Well I stay in the house almost entirely and am quite contented with old New England for a home.</p>

	You seem to be a very busy woman and happy in your work.  I have been trying to find you on the map of California.  In Napa county I find Belle and Belle's Station but that is farther north than I imagine you are.  Where shall I look for you?  </p>
	<p>
	Your account of the country church is very interesting.  I didn't suppose there was any such old-time church in the country now.  Mr Hopkins must be a remarkable man.  It's a pity there are not more like him.  In this time of business depression, and rapid growth in lawlessness of all kinds we need them.  The outlook for the future looks dark to me just now.  We can only put our trust in the God of Heaven above and of Earth beneath.</p>

	Have you ever heard any one speak of Roberts Meadow where your family lived at one time??  It was before I was born and (that was <u>eighty seven</u> years ago).  My people lived there too.  The two houses were near together and built alike after the plan of most houses of that time.  When I came across the enclosed picture it reminded me of the two old houses in Roberts Meadow.  R.M. is a little hamlet in the western part of Northampton.  It cuddles down in a depression between high hills.  Our early ancestors were attracted by the country and bought a large tract there which remained in the family until quite recent years.  There is a large brook running through the place.  Grandfather David Edwards took advantage of the fine water power it offered and built a tannery.  Your grandpa and my father  came to work there.  They met the Edwards girls, Althea and Hannah, and married them.  (There was a third daughter, Sarah, younger)  And settled down in the two old houses.  In course of time changes same about in the business.  My father went else where to live, and I suppose your father did too.  This, you see was before my time.  Later my father took his family back to the farm he owned in R.M. and by that time I had come along.  So my happy childhood was spent in Roberts Meadow but your family had left the place too.  And I only mt any one of them occasionally.  Your aunts Celia, Lucy and Fidelia I knew best.  The old houses disappeared long ago.  My father built a new one shortly before his death, in 1864.  Other changes have taken place and I no longer care to go there.</p>

	It is almost time for the mail man and you may be glad to have me say goodby for this time.  I like to hear about your family.</p>
	<p>  </p>
	<p>
	With love,</p>
	<p>  </p>
