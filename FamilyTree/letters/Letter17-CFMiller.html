	Dear ones,</p>
	<p>  </p>
	<p>
	Your much valued letter came duly to hand and was enjoyed by us all.  You have not heard much from me for a long time, i.e. from <u>my</u> pen.  Well it is not because I have thought less of you, but I have been so terribly <u>gripped</u> in the hands of Old Mr La Grippe.  Insomuch last winter,  sometimes I did not know but I would get this old bargue capsized on this sea of life.  And all last summer I did not recuperate.  And now, this winter, the concomitant effects of it are constantly with me, but I am not sick, but cannot stand much.  But live in hopes of recovery when it gets warm in the spring.  Howard, I often think of the long good letter you wrote last winter to me, but it was never replied to.  It hurts my eyes and my nerves to read or write much, so I dont try to do either much.  I often think of you all and am so glad you are beginning to help yourselves a little.  I think of you, Louis, and Chester, and well remember how you used to visit us at the old Clanton house, and call out Grandpa, Grandpa, as soon as you got there.  And little dear Blanch, you dont remember me do you?  How I would like to catch you up and kiss you, but when we get "Govt ownership", we'll come again.  Well C. is ready to go to the office,
	<br/>so I close with love and the best of wishes to all of you.</p>
	<p>  </p>
