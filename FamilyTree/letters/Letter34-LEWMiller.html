	Dear Lucy,</p>
	<p>  </p>
	<p>
	I will write you a short letter this morning and enclose one of Celias.  I know that you would like to hear from her.  I would'ent be surprised if they should remain at the Islands.  Horace is back there now, health much improved.  </p>
	<p>
	We are all of us well and able to work and there is plenty of it to do.  We have a dairy of 10 cows now.  Are still making butter.  We have our customers in town and get 25 ct #.  We keep some hens but hvent many chicks yet.  The hens were late about wanting to set.  We have three hens sitting on the eggs of the Rhode Island Reds.</p>
	<p>
	We are having lovely weather now, nice and warm.  The trees are nearly in full leaf.  Grass in our yard 8 or 10 inches high, currants and gooseberries loaded with blossoms.  Cherries, plums and apples are in bloom.  Small grain is looking fine.  Clarence and I will have some flowers this summer.  We have some plants that we have raised in the house.  C. has a cold frame filled with plants.  Some are Cal. flowers.  I have a bed of Cal popies.  They do well here.</p>
	<p>
	I would like to visit your home.  Your flowers must be fine.  Was'ent you fortunate that the earthquake did not visit your vicinity.  The desolation must be terrible in S.F.  It seems to me that I shouldent have the courage to build up there again.</p>
	<p>
	It is to bad that your back bothers you so much.  It may be your age that is the cause of your troubles.  I hope that you will get better of your aliments soon.  I know how to sympathize with you for I never had a very strong back myself.  I am trying a bottle of "Cas-ka".  It claims to cure rheumatism and kidney troubles to.  I will have to bring this to a close and get dinner.  Alice got your letter.  I had the pleasure of reading it.  She and family are all well.  Baby growing finely.</p>
	<p>
	With ever so much love to you and family,</p>
	<p>  </p>

	Mother</h4>

	Did you get a paper we sent you with Aunt Marys death in?  She died March 20 at Thads, in St Paul.  Father and I attended the funeral.  She was buried in the Eureka Cemetary.</p>
