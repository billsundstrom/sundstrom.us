	Dear Uncle & Aunt,</p>
	<p>  </p>
	<p>
	I was glad to hear from you again.  We have sold out and Albert our Marries daughter and husband are going to start for New Mexico.  There is a Miller of our family lives in Farmington.  I shall not move till they get there and settle.  We are so tired of cold and rain.  We have only had one pleasant day since last Thursday, snow and blow.  I had some postals taken of the home here and will inclose one.  Aunt Miriam says she would like to hear from you.  Her adress is Port Byron.  I hope you will find a good place to move.  I guess you did not like Call.  I think I should like it but not in Los Angelis.  If we can get out of here with enough to get a place, they intend to take up land.  I have been having touches of rheumatism and the gass we burn hurts my eyes.  I guess it is hard on the eyes.  Uncle Carl is very feeble but he seems to think he is as capable as ever.  It is a great thing when anyone knows when they are not able to care for themselves.  No one knows a think about his business.  He owns a nice house and large lot and has a family in the part of the house they used to live in.  He moved in the parlor and parlor bedroom and it is as filthy as it well can be.  He dont clean up a bit.  He will ruin every thing I guess.  I used to clean for him but for the last year since he moved in the parlor I have not been able.  He ought to have some one to care for him but I guess he could not get along with anyone.  I cannot stand it.  He keeps it so close and it smells, so I feel sick when I go to see him a little.  You cant tell him any thing.  He has a colt and he has kept it in the stall for five mo.  He is bent sidewise and carries water and feed to it.  He has a small mare we take care of and use her for her feed but it is more than it is worth to feed her.  But he cant take care of her.  Still he will have to do something when Al goes, for I can't take care of her.  I'll have one cow and some chickens and that will be enough with all the snow we have to shovel here a good deal of the time.  We have to shovel twice a day.  I guess we cant worst ourselves no matter where we go, but we are not so bad off here ua they are in the country.  They cant get to the woods.  There is so much drifting snow.  I hope this finds you well.</p>
	<p>  </p>
	<p>
	Yours with love,</p>
	<p>  </p>

	I will write and tell you where we move as I want to keep track of relitives.</p>
