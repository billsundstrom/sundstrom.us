	<p>Dear Lucy,</p>
	<p></p>
	<p>I will try and write you a few lines this evening.  We are all well as usual.  Aunt Mary is staying with us for a few days.  Arthur lost his six week old baby a short time ago.  It died very suddenly in the night.  It's mother woke up about six in the morning and found it dead.  The  Doctor said it had been dead 3 or 4 hours.  Another works in the Electric Light Plant.  He goes on at twelve in the night and works until noon.  It's rather hard for him but it is all he can find to do now.</p>
	<p>Our crops were good this year.  We raised a 1,000 bushels of potatoes off of five acres.  Sold over 700 bu. too the Shattuck for 40 cts per bu.  How are you and family getting along now?  Write soon, we want to hear from you all.  I will send Mary's & Celia's last letters.  We are having very pleasant winter weather, nice sleighing, not very cold yet.  Has Mr SinClair returned from the Klondike Country?  How are times in Cal. now?</p>
	<p>Wishing you all a Merry Christmas.</p>
	<p></p>
	<p>with much love,</p>
	<p></p>
