	Dear Lucy,</p>
	<p>  </p>
	<p>
	I will write you a few lines to let you know of a visit you are to have from Mr Elbert Miller of N Y State, a cousin of fathers.  He is the one who is getting up the Geneology of the Miller families.  He has been at the exposition at Seattle and touring the P. Coast, is now calling at Alice Cravens. </p>
	<p>
	I thought you might like to know of his coming.  He is a bachalor.  He wrote us for your adress.  We are having beautiful Oct. weather warm and sunny, no frost yet to hurt anything.  We are having string beans, sweat corn and tomatoes yet, such a nice lot of apples.  I wish you could see them.  The wealthys and __________ are beauties.  We get a dollar a bushel.  I am going to make some grape jam today.  We had a fine lot of them.  They took the first premium at the fair.</p>
	<p>
	I cant tell you what John & Mary will do.  Will let you know when we hear.  Was glad to get your letter.  Hope you will write again before long.  Those pictures were nice thanks.  All are well.</p>
	<p>  </p>
	<p>
	Love to all,</p>
	<p>  </p>
