	Dear Lucy,</p>
	<p>  </p>
	<p>
	I was just reading over your good long letter written in March.  I feel to thank you for your kind wishes for us.  I would only like it could we live somewhere near each other.  I am almost afraid father would'ent be contented in Cal.  You know how he is.  He has never been able to find anything to suit him but cold Minn and that he finds fault with at times, especially in winter.  I tell him we are getting to old to knock about the contry much.  It will be a big effort for me to pull up and move now, if we <i>should</i> sell, as Clarence wont be here to help.  I miss him so much.  He was so handy to do things that needed doing.  But then we could hardly expect him stay by us always.  He would like it to have us live with him in Cal.  He writes that he is well pleased with the country there abouts.  I would like to have been with you during those Evanglistic meetings.  They must have been very interesting.  I got those papers and read most of them.  Such seasons as those are refreshing and helpfull.  When I was younger, I used to enjoy going to them but now I dont get out much.  I begin to ralize that we are getting on to the down hill side of life and that we hav'ent very many years to live in this world.</p>
	<p>
	As you say I would like a little home where we could enjoy life away from the hurry and bustle of farm life.  Orville is commencing to build a barn, 30 x 46.  The old one we could'ent use much longer.  He wants to keep 12 or 14 cows.  We have 9 now and are raising 3 heifer calves this summer.</p>
	<p>
	May makes the butter.  We sell a part of the cream at the F. Creamery.  We have a Separator.  Father has tended to the chickens.  So far I guess we have had 100 hacthed but not that many lived.  Ours are mostly White Plymouth Rocks.  We have about 20 Brow Leghorn chicks.  We thought we would give them a trial.  Our fruit is promising good.  We are now having lots of pie plant and asparagus.  They are both fine.  Green currants most large enough to use.  I suppose you dont get those three things in Cal. much.  There will be plenty of gooseberries too.  Alice & Harry will be here this week.  He is going to help about the barn this week.  He is working in O.F.Brands nursery this summer.  He has a fine nursery now.  Arch is in company with him.  He has a place joinging Brands.  I guess I must close for this time.  <br/>Hoping to hear from you soon.</p>
	<p>  </p>
	<p>
	Yours with love,<br/>

	The rest of the folks are well and able to do their share of the work.  My love to Howard and all the children.</p>
