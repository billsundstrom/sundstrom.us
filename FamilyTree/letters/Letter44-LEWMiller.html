	Dear Lucy,</p>
	<p>  </p>
	<p>
	I must write you today.  It's almost a month since you wrote.  I was glad to get your good long letter.  You must enjoy your home now.  Dont it seem good not to have to move any more besides having to pay rent.  Aunt F sold her home at Webster to a Mr Mills.  I will send her last letter and one from Mary so you can hear from them.  The men folks have been awfully busy this summer getting in crops, hoeing, cultivating, haying and now harvesting.  We will soon have plenty of ripe apples and tomatoes.</p>
	<p>
	We are needing rain now.  It is pretty hot too.  It has been 90 and over for a week or more.  One day it was 98.  I hope the rain will come soon.  The rheumatism still troubles my right arm, hurts me a good deal.  I have to have help about dressing and undressing.  May has to comb my hear.  I cant raise my arm to my head.  To help it along I fell and struck on my right shoulder, which hurst it badly.  Clarence has to help do the work.  Father is as well as usual but gets pretty tired sometimes.  Clarence is well.  Will write when the hurry is over.  I should think you would miss Louis family.  You never have told us the childrens names.  Orvills family are all well and growing fast.</p>
	<p>  </p>
	<p>
	Love to all,</p>
	<p>  </p>
