	Dear Lucy,</p>
	<p>  </p>
	<p>
	I wont wait any longer to write.  It seems as if something has kept me from writing so long.  Yesterday I thought I would get a letter written but I had company to dinner.  I will write you a short one this morning  so you can hear form us.  We are all in usual health now.  Father has been having terrible colds and cough this winter, is well now.  How mild it has been so far excepting once the mercury went to 30 below.  ______ before and since it has only been to zero.  Feb. has been quite mild.  We had snow enough for sleighing a few days ago but now it is nearly all gone.  Beautiful bright sunshiney days now.  Last week it was cloudy and rainy most of the time.  Last _______ they butchered the two hogs left of last springs pigs.  We kept half of one sold the rest at six ____ they are only $380, live weight.  We have 2 big hogs that will weigh nearly 6 hundred apeice and 8 fine shoats of last fall pigs.  There is'ent much money in hogs this year, corn at 65 ct a bu.</p>

	We had a three weeks visit from Quart Kingely.  He said it was the first good old fashioned visit he had since Almirz died.  We had plenty of violin music while he was here.  Robert Boyles mad us a visit last week, staid over night.  When he was in Cal he said he was at Redlands.  He said he liked the looks of the country there very much.  Thought it could not so very hot there on account of the high elevation.  Tell Clarence Will Doroughty just got back from the coast countries.  He went to the Coos bay country.  Said it was very rough country and everything was very high.  His brother ______ was married last Wednesday.  He takes Neheirts place at the Lower Shattuck.  Lives on the _______.  ___________ died a short time ago.</p>

	We are looking for a letter from Clarence.</p>

	[on a separate piece of paper]</p>

	Clarence is thinking of going to Cal this spring if he was certain of getting work there.  He dont like to give up his Cal notions.  You wrote of a place father had a notion of buying was it at Long Beach.  We heard through Mr Hoover that it was worth $40,000 now.  I often think of our experience there.  Perhaps father would be more willing to accept of something there now.</p>
