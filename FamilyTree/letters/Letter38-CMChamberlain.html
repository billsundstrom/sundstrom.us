	Honolulu, Oahu  --  July 5, 1907</p>
	<p>  </p>
	<p>
	Dear Parents,</p>
	<p>  </p>
	<p>
	Mother's very welcome letter came with Lucys letter enclosed.  I never hear from her only through you, but I am glad to hear from her even if it is that way.  It must keep you busy to write to all your girls.  I am sorry some of them cannot be of any help to you at home.  But so it is, a family does get scattered in this life.</p>
	<p>
	I will send you some pamphlets that are discriptive of the Hawiian Islands.  They are gotten up by the promotion committee for distrubition.  By looking them over, you can find out more about the Haiian Islands than I could tell you in a year.</p>
	<p>
	We are getting used to the climate and people and like it better more and more.  We do enjoy the tropical fruit.  The nights are always cool so that any one needs to sleep under a blanket the later part of the night.  To day we got a letter from Auntie Wright and Aunt Fidelia.  I will enclose them.  Perhaps you would like to read them.</p>
	<p>
	The Whitneys had Aunt Fidelia come and stay with Auntie Wright while they went to New York City.  I think, for a vacation.  I would judge by Auntie Wright's writing that she was becoming very feeble.  She must have been in her younger years a very intilligent, able woman.</p>
	<p>
	This is a healthy climate.  We are enjoying very good health.  The extremely hot weather does not trouble us here.  It seems good not ever to have to wear thick heavy clothing.</p>
	<p>
	You spoke having plenty of pie plant and asparagus.  I well remember how good they tasted at home.  They do not grow here but they are shiped here from San Francisco and are some what wilted when they reach here.  Aunt Mattie and all the rest are about the same as usual.  Well I must close for this time.</p>
	<p>  </p>
	<p>
	Much love to all,</p>
	<p>  </p>

	Celia</h4>
