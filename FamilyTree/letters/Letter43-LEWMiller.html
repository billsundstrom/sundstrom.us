	Dear Lucy,</p>
	<p>  </p>
	<p>
	I will write you a few lines to go with these enclosed letters.  I have such a lame right arm from rheumatism that it is hard for me to use it.  I make out to do the work but it is very poorly done.  Clarence does the washing all the hardest of it.  I help what I can.  It seems like a long time since we have heard from you.  I remember I asked you to give us one of your good long letters but I havent seen anything of it yet.  Hope I will soon.  Our folks are very busy killing weeds and have commenced haying now.  We had 6 days of very hot weather last week, comencing a week ago last sunday.  It was 90.0 and over 95 one day.  How things did grow sweet corn is waist high.  Everything looks lovely beautifully green.  There is a prospect of good crops and plenty of fruit.  We have lots of currants, goosberries, some berries, and will have plenty apples.  I must close and go to ironing.  Write as soon as you can.   I expect you have to be very busy.  Excuse all mistakes.</p>
	<p>  </p>
	<p>
	From you Mother  --   Yours with love</p>
	<p>  </p>
	<p>
	Love and best wishes to all.  Excuse my crooked writing.  I guess you will laugh when you read the adress.  I had James written before I thought what I was doing.  I make mistakes now.  The folk are all in usual health.  The baby is a fine little fellow as good as can be.  How are the children there?</p>
