	Dear Lucy,</p>
	<p>  </p>
	<p>
	I will write you a little to send with your mothers letter.  I do now in these latest years of our lives, <u>so often</u> think of our past lives, of the <u>long road</u> over which we have traveled to reach our 70ties, and can hardly make it seem that I, that once little barefooted chap, when in my childhood home used to play together with my 2 brothers, and five sisters on that sightly old green hillside in my old boyhood home, far, far away, have now reached the age of 78, in October and am the last one left of the eight children in that lively happy home of long ago.  But so it is.  And then, again, I do <u>so many</u> times think of those palmy days when I went out for myself into the world to paddle on along lifes journey away from the dear old home, where I had been cared for, and instructed in the ways of my coming life.  How homesick I used to get and how often I would visit it, as it was only 13 miles away.  But in the nature of events, I soon got interested in the young society in which I was, when, after a little time, I saw your mother.  Well the <u>story</u>, like the<u>time</u> that has fled, for the 53 years the 26th of last month since she and I were married, would be a very long, long story, but of some of it you know.  But I think you dont know how we first settled in a little farm spot of land, 21 acres, 5 miles from my old paternal home at the head of Skaniatelas lake, in Cortland Co, N.Y.  Where we lived less than two years when we traded it for an 80, in Minnesota, near Farmington, Minn _____.  But we moved to Iowa, where we lived six years.  I working at wagon work 3 years in Waterloo ___________ and 3 yrs on the old place that father Wright lived on, which place your little eyes first looked out on this beautiful, but sin cursed world.  Orland was born at Waterloo, and 10 miles south of there Clarence and little <u>Lucy</u> our first <u>dear</u> little <u>girl</u> baby.  We called you our "Christmas present", altho you came one day after that day.</p>
	<p>
	You dont remember how we took you up in our arms, into an emigrant coverd wagon.  The next fall, (when you was about 8 months old) the 27th day of the next August, and started with you for Minnesota, to look for our land, the eighty acres we had got here.  You had a weeks ride then up to Minnesota.  Your Aunt Mary took care of Clarence, and Orlie, there in Iowa while we were gone.  And about 3 weeks we came back, and brought Uncle James for her, which paid her for taking care of our boys.  Then the next spring we came in our wagon to Minn. with all of our little ones, and Uncle James, and his <u>new wife</u> stayed there in Iowa.  And here 7 miles north, of our present home, we hewed out your old Minnesota home that is so often in <u>your</u> memory.  But, Oh Time!  How it changes all things here on this terrestrial sphere.  Tis sad, but all very natural, that it would ____ ___ ____.  Well, Lucy, I would like to have a long talk and visit with you and yours, but I dont ever expect to be able to, as we are getting too old to hope for much.</p>
	<p>
	We are but mere shadows of our former selves.  When we look at our enlarged photos that hang on the wall, we then see what a wonderful change time has wrought in our physical beings.</p>
	<p>
	I take a great deal of comfort in having Orvilles children to play with, be with.  Gertie the eldest is a fine smart girl 12 yrs next month.  She has made unusal progress in her school studies.  She takes to a higher grade in another school house next term.. Her teacher said to her that she "might well be proud of her fine Report Card", that she had done unusually well.  Lillian has been her first term, and is a good girl.  Little "Dale", 3 years old, is as smart as a trap, and Evelyn 2 years old is a very pert little thing and "Baby Brother", "Charles Lester"  is a very nice boy.  They all think so much of "Granpa". </p>

	With much love I am your aged</p>
