	34 New South Street<br/>
	Northampton, Mass<br/>
	Oct. 1 - 1934</p>
	<p>  </p>
	<p>
	Dear Cousin Lucy :-</p>
	<p>  </p>
	<p>
	Your letter to the Ned Hoxie family was given to me by the local Postmaster when I reported for work Saturday afternoon.  As I have worked for the Post Office Department for thirty three years there was no trouble in delivering your letter.</p>
	<p>
	Ned Hoxie otherwise know as David Edwards Hoxie died in Feb. 1921 and my mother who was just one month younger than my father died in Feb 1911.</p>
	<p>
	Brother James B. Hoxie lives in Walthan, Mass.  Is married and has a son James B. Jr.  Sylvester Edwards Hoxie, the youngest of the family, lives here in Northampton but works in the Customs House in Springfield.  He married my wives cousin Alberta Mason and has a son & a daughter.  The daughter, Vestah, is a student in Smith College and the son is a student in our Hight School.</p>
	<p>
	Myself George P Hoxie married in 1905 a descendant of John Stark.  Not John the revolution General but a cousin of the Generale.  We have four children.  David Edwards Hoxie, named for his Grandfather, Jonathan Stark Hoxie, named to match the David, Elouise Cynthia Hoxie.  She is the fourth Cynthia and is married to Enar Holgren and lives in Williamsburg, Mass.  My youngest is George P. Hoxie Jr. & is in the same class in High School as his cousin.</p>
	<p>
	Hardly anything in Roberts Meadow is like it used to be as the local water board have taken nearly all the land to prevent polution of the water supply.  I took your letter to Aunt Esther Witherell who you no doubt remember and she will write to you soon.</p>
	<p>
	My mother had pictures of some of your family in our old Family Album and I often wondered if I would ever see or hear from these cousins.  So I was very pleased to hear from you and hope you will write again and I will be happy to answer your questions.</p>
	<p>  </p>
	<p>
	Yours Lovingly,</p>
	<p>  </p>
	<h4>
	George P. Hoxie</h4>
	<p>  </p>
	<p>
	P.S.   I have a faint rememberance of a dinner at which one of both of you cousins were present and one of you had a terrible nose bleed.  I wonder if you remember? 	<i>G.P.H.</i></p>
