	Dear Lucy,</p>
	<p>  </p>
	<p>
	Here it is allmost Christmas and no letter have you had from us for a long time.  This is a <u>shame</u>.  All the while Alice was here, there was so much work to do with the sewing that we did not find any time for letter writing, and my unanswered letters had to wait.  I have to do all the writing to our friends now as they would never here from us and it is something of a task for me write.  I wish you would not wait for me to write.  I think your last letter was written in July.  We did not celebrate our Golden Wedding.  May was'ent able to be around about that time.  They have a baby boy six month old, quite a bright looking little fellow, has pretty black eyes and is real good, not much trouble.  Perhaps you have heard of it's arrival.</p>
	<p>
	Alice & Harry left us for there new home to 20 of Nov.  I have had one letter since there arrival there.  I will enclose it in this.  How we miss them.  Especially little Elbert.  He was such a bright attractive little child.  We became very much attached to him.  Do you hear from Mary ever?  I dont find her last letter or I would sent it to you.  I will send one I had from Aunt Fidelia, thinking you might like to read it.</p>
	<p>
	I expect Aunt Celia can hardly be alive now.  The last letter Celia wrote me, she had got down to the bed.  Warren built a new house on a ____ tract in the suburbs.</p>

	I have thought of something more to write.  We had some lemonade today made from a lemon of our own raising.  It was of the Pondarosa variety.  Only one came to maturity, a number set.  It measured four inches.  The lemonade was fine.  How is that for Minnesota.  The tree is 3 or 4 years old.</p>
	<p>
	The men folks killed a 300 hog last week.  We had half.  We rendered out the lard, 25 lbs., made some sausage.  The rest is in the pork jar.  I would like to treat you to a roast.  We shall have to sell some as we cant eat much ourselves.</p>
	<p>
	We are gettubg 35 cts for butter this winter, eggs are 30 cts.  We have some to sell every Saturday.  The winter has been mild so far, no snow to speak of yet.</p>
	<p>
	Perhaps you remember Charley ___________.  He died in Chicago of Pneumonia, was there on a visit to his sister Sarah Hunter.  He had been in the Republican Office 40 years.  He leaves a wife & two grown  up sons.  Thank you for your good wishes & kind letter.  I must close hoping to hear from you soon.</p>
