  	<p>
	Port Byron   May 8th '78</p>
	<p>  </p>
	<p>
	Dear Son Charles,</p>
	<p>  </p>
	<p>
	I thought that I would try and write a few lines to you as I feel anxious to hear from you.  But if you are well (as I hope you are) I suppose you have a plenty to do at this busy time in the year.  But now I know that Lucy can write a good plain letter.  Well, my health has ben rather poor the past winter and this spring, but I have had some appetite all the time and that has kept me along, but I am very weak now.  I don't pretend to do much.  I can walk around out doors some but it don't take much to throw me down.  I can sew a little and knit a little and read some in coarse print, but I feel very thankful that I can make out to write so as to be understood.  For if I could not, I should seldom hear from my children and distant friends.</p>
	<p>
	Anna and Lucretia have just been out here to make a visit.  For the first time, Lucretia's health is very poor.  Edwin's daughter is marryed to a little fellow by the name of Sweet.  They was quite opposed to the mach.  Oh, how I do wish that you lived where I could see you and your family sometimes.  But it will soon be all passed bye and I shall know nothing more about the things of the world.  But my usefulness is gone and I have not much to live for, but my prayer is that I may be readdy and willing to go when I am calld for.</p>
	<p>
	This may be the last that I shall write to you and it may not.</p>
	<p>  </p>
	<p>
	PSI ventured to send you $2 in this letter but if you should be short now, let me know and I will try and get a draft for you of ten dollars.  Please write or <u>have Lucy soon as</u> you get <u>this</u>.  Yours as ever.  My love and regards to all,</p>
	<p>  </p>
	<p>
	Your Mother,</p>
	<p>  </p>
