	My dear Cousin Lucy - </p>
	<p>  </p>
	<p>
	It was with a great deal of interest that I read a letter written by you to George Hoxie ( or any of the family).  George, having been a clerk in the Northampton Post Office for several years, received it without delay.  I only wish my brother - Ned Hoxie - could have had the pleasure in his lifetime of a correspondence with you.  He has been gone from us thirteen years.  He was born in 1840 and could have told you much of interest about the early life of your mother and her family.</p>
	<p>
	There may be some things I might tell you and if you would like to make any inquiries I will help you the best I can.  George is sending your letter to his older brother James who is like his father in many ways.</p>
	<p>
	I remember your aunts Lucy and Fidelia very well.  Fidelia was one of our family for a little time when I was a young girl, and after I had grown up and was a school marm myself they both came East on a visit spending some time with their Aunt Hannah - my mother.  Well, there seems to be no stopping place for my letter (although my pen is having a tantrum).  Memories of long ago come crowding thick and fast.  I wish I knew more about your family - I suppose those of my generation are all gone - I am the only one left of my immediate family and my husband, Alphonso Witherell - a native of Roberts Meadow - is the only one of a large family, now living.  On the 18th of this month we will have been married fifty eight years.  We have one son, four grand children and the dearest little great grandson you ever saw.  We are two very comfortable old people - <u>ninety one</u> and <u>eighty six</u> years of age - and very carefully looked after by our son and daughter in law.  I'll have to sign myself,</p>
	<p>  </p>
	<p>
	your <u>old</u> cousin,</p>
	<p>  </p>
