	My Dear Mother;</p>

	<p>
	Your kind letter came about a month ago.  I should have written sooner but as usual I have been very busy.  It does not do for me to tell every body that I am kept very busy because they would say that I must have any amount of time, not having children to care for.  But not having children makes it busier than ever for me because people are apt to think I have nothing to do and so I am expected to be at every thing; and really I am kept on the go most of the time.</p>
	<p>
	Did I tell you that I have a new Wheeler & Wilson sewing mechine.  We got it at store that was selling out.  It is a drop head ball baring with modern improvements.  We payed thirty dollars the machine.  Now I am learning how to make my own clothes.  I have sent away for several patterns and I hope to have good success.</p>
	<p>
	I am very fond of sewing and I think I will learn easily.  I have two summer dresses of percale and two thin waists to make for summer wear.</p>
	<p>
	There is a great deal of sickness in town.  March began with quite a spell of windy weather.  The snow is all off from the ground in town and it is very muddy.  </p>
	<p>
	How did Clarence like the west?  Does he still think of making his home out this way?</p>
	<p>
	Horace has been sick in bed nearly a week with the Grippe.  I think he will soon be around.  The people here want Horace to stay and we may but Horace is very much in need of a vacation of six months or a year.  And if we do not stay here we will go out on to a ranch three miles from here.  Clarence knows whare it is.  It is across the river from whare we all went for a walk.  It has several log buildings on the place and there is splendid hunting and fishing around there.</p>
	<p>
	Alice wrote to me quite a while ago and I answered but she has not written yet.  I suppose she is so happy and busy in her own house she does not find time to write.  I must close.  Much love to all.</p>
	<p>  </p>
	<p>
	Lovingly,</p>
	<p>  </p>
