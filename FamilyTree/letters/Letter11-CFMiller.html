	Faribault, Minn.  3.24.1899</p>
	<p></p>
	<p>Dear Lucy,</p>
	<p></p>
	<p>
	Yours of recent date was written to Alice, rec'd in due time, and it made me feel that you had been feeling that we had given you up, or had about forgotten you.  I don't know but you have had reasons for feeling thus.  As I do confess that we have been too remiss in writing, but now I want to say something that will be reassuring and trust you will ______ think and know that even if you have not heard from us in the past year or two as often as you should have heard, you may feel and be assured hereby that your name, and the names of every one of those dear ones of your little family, is often heard in our home, and ever with a heartfelt affection that never can die out or be forgotten.</p>
	<p>
	I speak of the old "Bossy" often and am so glad to know of her worth to you, and the good she is doing to the children.  I, many times, think of the day in which you came to our little home, away down in Iowa, in a little unhewn log house, in the Cedar Valley, on the prairie when we were young.  With two little boys already with us, then our dear little "Lulu" came, with her little blue eyes to cheer us on to more and greater exertions to provide for our dear little ones.  And we were as poor as we could be, then, almose, and a long time has passed since then.  And with it many, many changes have come to us all.  One of our little band has "gone over there".  Your father & mother must soon go, but we never, never, never forget you Lucy, or any one of our dear ones, but remember them at the throne of Grace.</p>
	<p>
	What you said about being poor, I wish to speak of.  You do feel, no doubt keenly, and it is too bad that those who are so worthy of all of the things that they have and are working for is wrested from them by the jewelled fingers of the idle rich, who gamble and toy with our earnings.  Yet, I can see in the horizon, a cloud arising that ere long, my set things a right, and will relieve the want that is everywhere felt.</p>
	<p>I like to look at little Blanch's picture that is taken with her three cousins.  She looks a good deal as you used to.  We think you are much better located than in the old "Doby" where now church work & privileges are at hand.  I wish it could have been so that we could have been settled near you so as to visited.  And now in my declining years, I feel that I could so much enjoy it and romp with the grandchildren.  </p>
	<p>
	Since little Gertie came among us, and as I have been with her every day most, I find that I am so attached to her, that if we were to part it would be hard for me to say the "good bye".  She is a dear sweet little girl, such a good disposition.  Is now pratting about everything.  She went with her parents up to Tuppers, and was caught up ther by cold weather, and was gone away some 5 days.  When I first took her up, she put her little hands on my face & head and said "ga" "pa", "ga" "pa", "ga" "pa", a dozen times I guess.</p>
	<p>
	The latter 1/2 of our winter has been too cold for us.  This month has been much worse than Jan. was, is cold to day.  Our houses are comfortable, but O, it is so unlike the old home, without its strong wind protection.  Could'nt find a place near enough to town with protect. about buildings.  I told Clarence when we first saw this place that we had better take it and when we found a better one we'd sell and get that.  But haven't seen it yet.</p>
	<p>Maybe in my next letter, I'll have some news to tell you.</p>

	Dear Lucy & all, </p>
	<p>  	</p>
	<p>
	Mother has just read me her part of this letter, and I will now take my inning and give you a "few lines", whether there is any <u>thoughts</u>  or not.</p>
	<p>
	She has made so many <u>busy</u>  excusess why she has neglected you so <u>inexcusably</u>  long.</p>
	<p>
	I have been prompting her for months past of her duty to you, but when your letter came I tell you she began to hunt for a pencile in a hurry, the result of which I herewith enclose.</p>
	<p>
	We all feel pretty nice to think that we have got "______" of the old home up in Forest, and have such a nice place, so near in to the city.</p>
	<p>
	The old dutch neighbours express to me their regrets in their loss of us.  Say they have not got nearly so good neighbours there now.  My health is fine, ____ trouble gone.  Some how I don't like Cal. even a little bit.  How would it be with us now if there?  Our crops last y'r was good, and this y'r are fine.  We'll soon have acres of berries and are so near to the market and can get all the pickers wanted that we will make it win.  Mary got through her tierra-del-fuego of parturition nicely and her countanance has taken on a much more healthy look.  </p>
	<p>
	How does "One Horn", your bossy do?  That calf that we brought back, we are now milking, is 2 years old, is a larger cow than yours, gives a nice lot of milk.  We bought a 2 horse corn planter in with a <u>naber</u> and a McCormick binder with a naber.  We are getting on our feet again.  Now we'll look for an acct. of your doings.  Which we'll be glad to know.</p>
	<p>
	Affectionately,</p>
	<h4>
	Father</h4>
	<p>
	Regards to <u>all</u>  of the Clewetts.</p>
