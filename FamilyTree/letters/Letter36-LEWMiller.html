	Dear Lucy,</p>
	<p>  </p>
	<p>
	I am writing to Mary and Aunt Fidelia and yours comes next.  My letters are short this time for I dont feel overly smart.  I recived both of your letters and have enclosed this last one in Aunt F's.  Thought she might like to read it.  I got a letter from Celia yestoday.  Aunt Celia died the first of Feb, after such a lingering illness.  It is 5 or 6 year since she had Apoplexy.  We all feel to rejoice that she is at rest.  I presume Horace & Celia will stay there.  Perhaps you remember she that was Alice Moore.  Her father maried Cornelia Miller, your fathers sister.  Do you remember of her father and her visiting us one winter.  They lived then west of here 50 miles.  Aunt Annie, father's sister, her husband, was dead so she wanted them to come and live with her and take care of her whilst she lived.  They are to have her home.  Alice has five or so children, one boy.  I would like to see you and your family again.  I dont know as I ever will.  Cant you fix up and come and visit us this summer?  Wouldent we have a nice visit.  You could live as plain as you liked and not eat any more times than you wished.  Old folks have to live plain, I find.</p>
	<p>
	It will be nice for you to have Lewis settle near you.  The rest of us are well now.  Orville was sick with Grip two weeks, is well now.</p>
	<p>  </p>
	<p>
	Love to you and all the rest of the family.</p>
