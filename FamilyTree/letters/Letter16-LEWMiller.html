	Faribault, Minn. -- Feb. 9-1901</p>

	Dear Lucy,</p>
	<p>  </p>
	<p>
	I will try and write you a few lines now.  I wish it was easier for me to write, then you might hear from me oftener.  We are having a mild winter so far without much snow. Not enough for sleighing yet, but splendid wheeling all winter.  The Mercury has only been 15 below zero once or twice.</p>
	<p>
	There has been ever so much sickness here and a good many deaths, Pneumonia & La Grippe quite prevelent.  How is it with you?  I read in one of our papers that there was 500,000 cases of la grippe between N.Y. city and the Pacific Coast.  One of our near neighbours lost a son with Rheumatism of the heart.</p>
	<p>
	We have all been pretty well with the exception of colds.  Father keeps around but not able to do much.  He has hardly got over the effects of his last winters sickness.  Alice is about well of her sickness, but she is not as stout as she used to be.  Her stomach troubles her so that she has to be very careful what she eats.  Has to let alone sweat things entirely ____ vegitables and bread.  She uses baking powder biscuit.  She is staying a Arthur's this winter.  His wives health is poor.</p>
	<p>
	Mary lives in the upper rooms of the house in which they live.  John is working at Sheffields now.  He expects to have a situation soon in an elevator they are building on the Burlington R.R., that is being built through here to the cities.  They will take a new rout from the other two.  From F. it will pass near Millersburg crossing O'Grady's farm and J. Hatfields pasture, west of the farm buildings.  They expect a station near there.  The road is about completed to F.  Mary and her little Chester are well.  He is a bright cute little fellow of 2 ys past.  Orville & May are still living in the other house.  Gerty grows like a weed.  Grandpa and her are like two children.  She is down here most every day to visit.  I wish you was'nt so far away so that we could see you and your family once in awhile.  If we ever get government ownership of the R.R.s, we may have the opportunity.  Clarence boards with us and helps work the place.  We could'ent get along without him.  I begin to feel a little old and stiff myself.  Clarence has to help me about the washing.  I have made butter all winter.  We have two cow that have given milk through the winter.  One was fresh late last fall.  Butter and eggs have been high all winter.  Creamry butter 30 cts, Dairy 25, eggs was up to 27 one spell.  Horace & Cleia did'ent stay in the Islands.  It was very hot there last summer and it gave him the headache all the time.  Aunt Celia bcame  well physically, but mentally was no better.  She wanted to do her work alone with Uncle Warrens help.  So that let them out.  They are now located in Columbia City, Wash.  I will send her letter to you with this.  I am so glad to get your letters.  I wish you would write oftener.  Is Mother Clewett living yet?  </p>
	<p>
	I do remember the story you mentioned and it was a good one, too.  They have a large circulating Library in F.  I have drawn several book this winter and read them aloud to Father.  His eyes trouble him so he can't read much himself.</p>
	<p>
	I must close now with love to you and all the rest of the family.  All send their love to you and expect you will have more letters than you can read soon.</p>
	<p>  </p>

	Mother</h4>
