	Dear Lucy,</p>
	<p>  </p>
	<p>
	I must sent you a few lines this morning, hoping it will bring a letter.  I have thought many times I would write you and then I did not set myself about it, thinking every mail a letter would come.  We are all in usual health.  Father is able to be about and ride to town, but can't do much work.  They have just finished digging the potatoes.  They turned out over 1,000 bushels.  Got 40 cts a bushel for 900 bu. or all they sold.  We have two men husking corn.  It's yielding good.  They expect to have 8 or 900 bushels.  The thrashing is not done yet.  I guess it will be next week.</p>
	<p>
	We are having a very mild fall so far, no hard frosts.  Grass as green as in May.  I picked a nice boquet last night.  Morning glories in bloom and sweet peas and other flowers have taken the second growth.  Young tomatoe plants, lettuice and mustard.  We had a nice bed of Rosellas, but the first frosts killed them before they had blossomed, to tender for this country.  Well, how are you and your family?  Well I hope and doing well.  Father never answered Howard's letter.  He must take the will for the deed.  He dos'ent write at all or read scarcely at all.  His eyes bother him a great deal.  <br/>
	I must close now in hopes that this will bring a letter soon.</p>
	<p>  </p>
	<p>
	Yours Affectionately,</p>
	<p>  </p>
	<h4>
	Mother</h4>
	<p>  </p>
	<p>
	Love to all rest.</p>
