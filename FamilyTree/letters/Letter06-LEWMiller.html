	Dear Lucy & family,</p>
	<p>   </p>
	<p>
	I was glad to hear from you and that you were all getting along so well.  I am sure that little Blance will be a treasure you would not like to part with,  May she prove a blessing and comfort to you all.  Give her a kiss for me and the little boys, too.</p>
	<p>
	I expect I shall surprise you when I inform you that <u>our</u> baby has left us.  Is married and living in Chicago.  Horace Chamberlain & Celia were married last Thursday at half past one o'clock, out in the dooryard, ______________ in the shade of the trees, between the house and barn.  Mr Wallace Pres. minister of Faribault, officiated.  After dinner, we drove with them to __________ to take the 6 o'clock train.  Horace is pastor of a church in Chicago, 5 miles from the University which he is attending.  He has one more year to finish the course.  They will board near the church.</p>
	<p>
	We are all well as usual and very busy.  Clarence is at home again.  Has been here about three weeks.  Mary and husband are well and all the rest of the relatives.  Thad Lockwood lives in Owatonna.  Has gone into business for himself.  If he makes a success of it, will be married too before long.  Arthur has engaged himself to one of Minne Kings____ girls, May.  So it goes.  </p>
	<p>   </p>
	<p>
	Love to you all,</p>
	<p>   </p>
