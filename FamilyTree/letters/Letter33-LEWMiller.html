	Dear Lucy,</p>
	<p>  </p>
	<p>
	We just got your letter to day and I wont wait for father to answer it, for it takes him so long to get about it.  I had just got around to all my correspondents but you.  Now I will write you for fear I will delay it to long.  It is so easy to neglect a duty of that kind.  I often think of you and your family and wish I might step in and visit you awhile as I can with Alice.  They are getting along quite well now.  Harry has a situation in Theopolds Wholesale House.  He went there as soon as he was through at Brands.  I think he is better satisfied now that he has a good place and paying wages and no lost time.  He has good health and with all is quite a pleasent and capable man.  Alice is much better.  Baby Elbert is getting along nicely, developing fast into an active bright boy, the perfect image of his father.</p>
	<p>
	Mary and her family are getting along quite well out in Dakota.  A good many settlers have gone in there within a year or two.  Crops have been good since they have lived there.  This year John raised quite a crop.  He had six good stacks of wheat besides other crops.  They have one more year, then he will prove up.  There is one objection to living there.  They are so far from the railroads, 28 mi from Manden and 12 from Washburn, across the Missouri River.  70 cts one way to cross the ferry to W.  I guess Mary dont get to town very often.  Feuel is cheap.  There is plenty of Lignite Coal.  There, they can get a wagon box load at the mines for $1.00.  I dont know whether I have written you since Celia went to Honolulu.  They was living at Priest River, Idaho.  Horace is now in a Sanitarium at Portland, Or.  He went there the first of Nov and will stay through Feb.  Celia stayed with the Whitneys at Seattle until the forpart of Dec.  Uncle Warren sent for her to come and stay with them for awhile.  She writes that Aunt Celia is quite feeble, has almost lost her mind, cannot dress herself and does not remember anything for five minutes.  Celia say she is pleasent and easy to take care of.  She will soon be 75.  It's five years since she was attacked with the disease, softing of the brain.  She writes that it is simmer weather there flowers in bloom.  She could go out into the yard and gather oranges, lemons and bannas.  Warren writes that she is contented and happy and that we might be assured that she would be well taken care of.</p>
	<p>
	We have had a mild pleasnt winter so far.  No snow to speak of until after New Years.  Now, what snow we have lays in banks.  It like to have all melted two weeks ago.  Its poor sleighing now.  How fast the winter goes.  Soon it will be March.</p>
	<p>
	Our health is as good as could be expected.  I am able to do my work with some help from the men folks.  Hav'ent been troubled with colds or the Grip.  The men find it much pleasenter doing there work in the new barn.  They milk 8 cows now, making considerable butter.  We have our customers at 25 cts. a lb.  I dont have any thing to do with it now.</p>
	<p>
	It is to bad that you have to be troubled with your stomach.  I guess Father must have entailed it to some of his children.  Orvilles stomach bothers him most of the time.  He has to gulp wind so much of the time and has to be careful what he eats.  Alice stomach is about well if whe is careful not to eat anything to agrevate it.  I am glad you are all getting along so well.  I hope your children will be a great comfort to you.  Thanks for your good wishes for us.  I must close now with much love and good wishes to you all.</p>

	Mother said I'de not get at it to write but I will at least say "How do you and good bye".  You must fast for the curing of your stomach trouble.  As some has said "go hungry tell you are so much in need of food that it wont hurt you."  Say 2 days or 3 or 4, they say is better.  Then eat only enough to have it digest. </p>
	<p>  </p>
	<p>
	Yours affectionately,</p>
	<p>  </p>

	Father</h4>

	<p>
	Will write you again.  This being Valentine day, you have below my Valentine.</p>
