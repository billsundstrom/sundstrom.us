	Dear Lucy,</p>
	<p>  </p>
	<p>
	I have waited so long before answering your welcome letter.  I am afraid you will begin to think I have forgotten you but such is not the case.  I think of my absent girls every day and I often wish I could run in and see you all in your homes.</p>
	<p>
	Would'ent it be nice if we had government ownership of the R.R., then we might see one another once in awhile.  I think that you must be getting to be quite a farmer.  I presume that your health is better for the out door work you get.  I expect you find plenty to do in taking care of your stock and fowls.  Fowls pay better there than here.  The trouble of wintering is not so great as here.  Orville built a nice new hen house with a cement flour.  We still have the ____________, last year we sent for a setting of ___________ eggs.  We raised 6 pullets & 2 roosters.  They are beauties.  I am making lots of butter now.  We have four fresh cows and a Sharpless separator, so we get all of the cream.  Have to churn three times a week.  We get 24 ct # for our butter.  Tell Chester we have 16 little pigs, smart & lively, and are raising 3 heifer calves this year.  Raised two last so you see we will soon have a flock of cows. </p>
	<p>
	We have had lots of cool damp weather all through Apr. with some rain.  Grass is very forward and the trees partly leaved out.  We have had pie plant to rise for about two weeks.  A few nights ago it got frozen some.</p>
	<p>
	You asked me in your letter how Alice got acquainted with Mr Turner.  Well I will tell you.  It was through a Matrimonal Paper while at Hatties in Excelsior, 3 years ago last fall.  She happened to come across a peice of one printed in Chicago with Mr Turners add. in it.  She answered it and he selected her from several others to correspond with.  They coresponded three years.  Last fall he proposed sending the money for her to meet him part way and her father to accompany her.  After due reflection, she decided to do so.  They met in Oklahoma City and were married there Dec 3rd, at noon and then took the afternoon train for his home.  Father was very much pleased with him and his personal appearance.  They seem to be well satisfied with each other.  I get a long letter from her quite often.  Mr Turner & bros. have 200 acres partly timber.  They raise corn and cotten.  She writes that they will have lots of fruit this season.  Peaches, plums, grapes & berries with all kinds of vegitables.  They have wild Dewberries.  They are begining to turn now and such a variety of wild flowers, she writes.</p>
	<p>
	I suppose you will recognize the old home.  Mary and family are all well and busy fighting the battles of life for an existence.  I must close now and do up my mornings work.  With much love to you & Howard and the children.  We are all in usual heaalth and drove with work just now.</p>
