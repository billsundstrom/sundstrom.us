	Dear Lucy,</p>
	<p>  </p>
	<p>
	I will just write you a few lines to let you know that I got your last letter and the paper that had John Clewetts marriage in.  As you say I hope he has done well.  I thought him to be a worthy young man.</p>
	<p>
	I will enclose in this Alice last letter and also one from her husband.  You can judge for yourself of her and her surroundings.  As far as I can know I should think she had found a good husband.  I will send some pictures that Clarence took with his Hodge.  He has had the negatives sometime.  He finished them up himself.  The old log house is gone long ago.  Mr Davison built a fine large house south of the barn where the shop stood.  Tore down all the sorghum works.  Has built another large barn, west of the other.  He bought the farm north of the schoolhouse.  Charley M__ Theelip used to own it.  <br/>
	I must close now.  Hoping to hear from you again soon.</p>
	<p>  </p>
