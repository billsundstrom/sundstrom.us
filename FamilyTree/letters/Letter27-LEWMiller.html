	Dear Lucy & Family,</p>
	<p>  </p>
	<p>
	Tomorrow is the 1st of Feb.  Old winter is going fast.  I dont care how quickly it passes.  We have not had any severe storms so far.  Not enough snow for real good sleighing yet, but there is time enough for plenty of snow yet.</p>
	<p>
	It is a beautiful bright sunshiney day but as Uncle Carl used to say looks are deceiving.  It is "_______________".</p>
	<p>
	We had a letter from she that was Alice Moore and also a photo of herself & family.  She has six children, 1 boy & five girls.  They are living at Friendship with Aunt Annie.  She is 89, and almost blind.  Is in good health and has all her faculties yet.  Uncle Carl lives in Friendship all alone.  Aunt Lucretia died some time ago.  Uncle Edwin lives in Scranton, yet has a second wife.  Has two children living.  I never hear from Aunt Celia at the Islands.  Only through Celia in her last letter she said she was about the same.  Her mind was no better.  She was cheerful and happy, able to work about the house some.  She is _____.</p>
	<p>
	I suppose you dont hear frome Celia direct.  I presume she would like to have you write to her.  There adress is Priest River Idaho.  I expect you hear from Alice occasionly.  Her health has not been very good since she went to Texas.  She wasent as healthy here after she had the Typhoid Fever.  I suppose you know that she has a boy about six weeks old.  Mr Turner wrote us.  He seemed very much pleased over his boy.  Alice wrote that he tood the whole care of her & baby and done all the wash, cooking & washing.  She thinks that she has the best of husbands.  I am glad Alice was a very capable girl every way.  And like yourself will do all she can to get along.  I often wonder how you stand it to do as much as you do.  You was'ent very strong when you was at home.  I was glad to hear that Lewis was doing so nicely.  I hope he will continue to be a comfort to his parents.  It is a good trait in a young person.  What is Lewis age?  You wont have to work so hard when Chester & Blanche get grow.  I think you must be quite a business woman to do all you do and keep a full account of every you do.  Well that is one way to succeed.  I say in last weeks paper that it was quite cold in L.A.  Have you had rains yet?  Things are moving along here just about as usual.  Mr Fritz Smith of Forest was buried last week.  Mr & Mrs Weatherson went to Oregon to spend the winter.  Henry & Rob both live there at Eugene.  Ella and Lelie are the only ones at home now of that large family.  I suppose that you remember _____ Kingsley.  He buried his second wife last fall.  Boston and his fourt wife are living, yet.  John Kelly, Minnie's husband, has got to be Hon.  He goes to the capital every winter.  The oldes boy Cyrus goes to Wash., D.C. every winter.  John & Lilly K. live at the old home place.  Father & Mother both gone.</p>
	<p>
	I see I have arrived at the bottom of the page.  I will have to close.  Mary will have to tell you the rest.  <br/>
	Love to yourself and all the rest.</p>

	Father is better this winter than usual.</p>
