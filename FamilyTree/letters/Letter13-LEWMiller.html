	Dear Lucy,</p>
	<p> </p>
	<p>
	I must write you a short letter this morning so I can take it down to the Office this afternoon.  We have all been making you a birthday present, that is, Mary, Alice, May & myself.  The lampmat is from May.  The blue mat from Alice, the other one from Mary.  I knit the wash, wrags the smallest for Blanche, the other is yours.  We are having a mild winter so far, no snow to speak of yet.  Mary is with us still but expects to go to housekeeping soon.  John is still working at the Sheffield mill as under wheat buyer.</p>
	<p>
	Father is not feeling very well.  Has been in bed for the past two or three days.  Has had a slight fever.  I think he is a little better this morning.  Gertie came down a few minutes ago to see her Grandfather and now Chester and she are sitting on the bed, each side of him, caressing him.  Gertie says Granpa get well.  Alice is almost recoverd from her sickness.  She thinks of going back to Excelsior in two or three weeks.  She has lost a good share of her hair.  Aunt Mary has gone up to St. Paul to stay awhile with Thad.  Poor woman, I'm afraid she don't lead a very happy life.  Perhaps there is blame on both sides.  </p>
	<p>
	I was glad to learn of the change you had made in your home.  You certainly will enjoy having more room and pleasanter surroundings and such a good place for your cow & chickens.  I hope you will do well with your undertaking.</p>
	<p>
	Mr Brand starts for Cal. this week to visit his brothers who live at Pomona.  He expects to stay all winter.  Will visit Los Angeles.  He took your address.  You may receive a call from him.  Archie and wife are living there.  I guess they expect to stay there a few years. </p>
	<p>
	Frank was married a few weeks ago and lives on a farm that his father bought last summer.  John stays at home, was in the army last summer but did not get a chance to fight.</p>
	<p>
	I had a letter from Aunt F.  She was lamenting that she was not able to find you.  She has been dismissed from teaching with a number of others of her age.  Mrs McSpaden, the lady that went with her on her trip, will stay with her this winter.</p>
	<p>
	Mary's little Chester is a happy little fellow.  He makes music for us trudging around from morning till night.  Some days not taking a nap at all.  We shall be lonesome when he goes away.</p>
	<p>
	How are all your children?  I suppose they have grown so I would hardly know them.  Lewis will soon be a young man, able to help father & mother ever so much.  Chester I remember as quite a stiring boy.  I expect you will be a great help to mother with her chickens and garden.  And Blanch will soon be able to help do the housework.  I know you must get more enjoyment of your life now than when you lived in the old <u>dobe</u>.  Remember me to the Clewetts.</p>
	<p>
	Grandpa sends his love to the children and would like to see them & you all.  A merry Christmas to you & Howard and the children.</p>
	<p> </p>
	<p>
	With much love,</p>
	<p> </p>
