  	<p>
	My dear Cousin - </p>
	<p>  </p>
	<p>
	The little verse on the Christmas card expresses my wish for you and yours.  I hope you are able to have all your family with you on Christmas day and will have a happy time.  My family is small - one son, his wife, and four grandchildren all grown up but like children on Christmas day - ready for a good time and happy to be together.</p>
	<p>
	The oldest daughter is married and lives in Princeton, N.J.  She cannot be with us on the 25th as she has a baby son who is too small for the trip in our New England winter -  It will be the first break in our family gatherings -  My husband and I spend our time trying to keep warm and succeed fairly well but like summer time better.  We are very comfortable for people of our age.</p>
	<p>  </p>
	<p>
	Merry Christmas to all,</p>
	<p>  </p>
	<h4>
	Cousin Esther Witherell</h4>
