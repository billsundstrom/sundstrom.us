	Dear Lucy,</p>
	<p> </p>
	<p>
	I must not delay any longer in answering your letter.  It don't seem possible that it is allmost a month since I got yours.  Time flies so fast.  Mary is with me again.  She staid two weeks with John's folks.  We are having a hot spell of weather now.  The mercury has been at 90, and there abouts for 5 days.  But we have had a good rain so it makes it bearable.  It was some dry before the rain, especially on light soil.  Nothing suffered here.  We have an excellant soil, better than on our old place in Forest.  There is a large Canning Factory located near the bridge at the north end of town.  Aunt Mary __________  ________ called there the other day.  It is quite a sight to see them at there work.  I should presume that there are 100 men, woman, girls & boys employed there.  A great _________ of the sweet corn is raised here near Canon City.  There is a new R.R. being built into town, a branch of the Chicago & Great Western.  The Canon Valley was bought by them last spring.  The Depot will be back of the Brunswick Hotel.  We will have to cross the track in going to town just after we get through the coverd bridge.</p>

	Mary's little Chester is growing finely, has flaxen hair, large blue eyes, very white complexion, looks now as if he might make as small a man as his grandfather Miller.  Gerty talks a good deal.  Understands pretty much all you say to her.  She is right the opposite of Chester.  I should judge that she would make a tall woman.  Do you remember Aunt Anna?  She has lost both of her adopted daughters.  Sarah died a short time ago.  So your aunt was left without any one to look after her.  Edwin Miller of Scranton, PA, came after her and took her home with him.  He has his second wife now.  His children are all married.  Alice is expecting to come home the first of Oct. for a months visit.  Hattie is going to visit her sister that lives in Des Moines, Iowa.  How is the fruit coop in Cal.?  Apples are scarce here this year, not many wild plums.  I made some wild black cherry jam the other day, was good.  I tried some high bush cranberries too.  The jelly is excellant.  I would like to see the children again.  I expect they grow out of my remembrance.  Father is stretched out on the lounge with both of the children crawling over him.  They are like three children.  I must close with ever so much love to you and family.</p>
