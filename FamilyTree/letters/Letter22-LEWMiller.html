	Dear Lucy,</p>
	<p>
	Yours of Feb 8 received, I will answer it right away.  I am always glad to get a letter from you although you make me wait a long time.  But when they do come they are long and newsy.  Chesters picture came too.  He looks nice.  How he has grown.  I forget his age, 12 is he?  I guess he is his mother's boy.  Well, it wont be long till Lewis & he will be young men.  You are 40 past I believe.  It dont seem possible.  I am glad you are going to have a home of your own, if it is small.  If you can do as well on it as an old man and his wife did on an acre in northern Cal., you can lay up money.  I have cut it our and send it in this.  I suppose its gospel truth.  That clipping you sent me is good.  I wish there was more minister like him.  I dont think there is one in F. of that stamp.  The most of them are afraid to declare the whole truth.  We <u>have</u> had quite a snug winter but not as cold as we sometimes have it.  The lowest 20 below zero.  I will send you Marys last letter.  Her birthday is the 10th of Mar.</p>

	Alice would have written to you before this but did'nt remember your No.  I sent it to her in my last so you will get a letter soon.  Thanks for Chesters picture.  I must close hoping to hear from you ere long.</p>
	<p>  </p>
	<p>
	Love to all the family,</p>
	<p>  </p>

	The rest are all in usual health.</p>
