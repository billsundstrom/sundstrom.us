Scott PESCARA
<p>
<a name ="I066771"><b>[I066771]</b></a><br />
A former Albion man faces up to 20 years in prison after he was convicted Friday of shooting a Monroe County sheriffʼs deputy after he went berserk following an argument with his wife.<br>
Scott Pescara, 42, was found guilty of attempted aggravated assault on a police officer, second-degree assault and first-degree reckless endangerment.<br>
Pescara was acquitted on charges of second-degree assault and attempted first-degree assault in the shooting of his neighbor, Nellie Marshall, who was hit in the shoulder from a round fired by Pescara.<br>
According to the Democrat and Chronicle, jurors supported the claim that Pescara had no way of knowing Marshall was in the house because she was behind closed blinds.<br>
Pescara fired more than two dozen rounds from a handgun from inside his house on Route 31A in the town of Sweden on Jan. 8, 2010. The shooting happened after an argument with his wife, Jeanine, who was not home at the time of the shooting.<br>
One of those rounds hit Marshall. The other struck Deputy Jonathan Strong in the leg.<br>
Pescara, who moved from Albion to Sweden about five years ago, had been free on $250,000 bail posted last fall.<br>
The judge in his case revoked bail after the jury returned its verdict after more than a day of deliberating.<br>
The trial lasted four weeks. Pescara was represented by John Parrinello. Assistant District Attorney Timothy Prosperi prosecuted.<br>
Judge James J. Piampiano set sentencing for Sept. 29. Pescara faces seven to 20 years in prison.<br>
------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
ROCHESTER -- A father of two has been sentenced to 16 years in prison for shooting a sheriff's deputy in upstate New York while high on alcohol and drugs.<br>
Scott Pescara was convicted last month of attempted aggravated assault on a police officer and related charges. At sentencing Friday, the 44-year-old said he was "completely remorseful."<br>
Authorities say Pescara randomly fired dozens of rounds from his house in the Rochester suburb of Sweden in January 2010.<br>
A woman across the street was hit in the shoulder and a responding officer, Monroe County Deputy Jonathan Strong, was wounded in the leg. Neither was seriously injured.<br>
Pescara blamed his estranged wife for driving him to drink gin and take prescription pills. The defense argued he was too intoxicated to intentionally shoot anyone.<br>
