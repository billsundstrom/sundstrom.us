Carl Edward LINDSTROM
<p>
<a name ="I092077"><b>[I092077]</b></a><br />
Rev. Carl E. LINDSTROM Of Mercer Island, died July 28, 2003, at age 94. A Graveside Service will be held at 10 a.m., Thursday, August 14, at Lake View Cemetery on Capitol Hill. This will be followed at 2 p.m. with a Memorial Service to be held at Covenant Shores Retirement Center located at 9150 - Fortuna Drive on Mercer Island. The family extends a special thank you to the staff at Covenant Shores for their loving care given during the last years of Carl's life. <br>
The Seattle Times, 12 August 2003<br>
-----------------------------------------------------------<br>
Carl Lindstrom put compassion to use<br>
He spent his early boyhood on a farm in the Skagit Valley. As a young man, he worked as a seaman, roaming the world from Sweden to China. Then, preparing to settle down with a Seattle bride, he entered a seminary and emerged a Baptist minister.<br>
Life was quite a journey for the Rev. Carl E. Lindstrom, who died July 28 at the age of 94 at the Covenant Shores Retirement Center on Mercer Island.<br>
Throughout his postings as an Army chaplain and a minister in small Washington towns, family members say the Rev. Lindstrom displayed a deep sense of compassion. He valued service over money and material possessions. Never amassing large personal wealth, he was always ready to give to others.<br>
"I'm sure that hobos had our door marked," the Rev. Lindstrom's son David said. "They would always find their way to the house and ask for lunch, and he usually gave them food or money. Once, they were even given my father's overcoat."<br>
<br>
The Rev. Lindstrom had his own share of hard times. He was born in Seattle on March 27, 1909, the only child of Swedish immigrant parents. The family moved to a Skagit Valley homestead near Burlington, where they struggled to make a living off the land while living in a one-room house lit by a kerosene lantern.<br>
His mother died as a result of the 1918 flu epidemic, and young Carl was sent to live with his aunt and uncle, Hokan and Victoria Olson, in Seattle. There, he was like a big brother to the Olsons' daughter, Margaret.<br>
"He was a very good student," recalls Margaret Olson Pryne. "So when I got to high school and got a B, I always heard about it. How Carl always got A's."<br>
After graduating from Ballard High School in 1926, he decided to sample life as a merchant seaman. He crewed ships that took him up and down the West Coast, to China where he visited the Great Wall and to Sweden in 1928. There, in the homeland of his parents, he jumped ship to journey north to visit relatives. He stayed on for six months before finding work aboard another ship that took him back to the United States.<br>
Back in the States, he could not forget a Swedish girl - Eleanor Gustafson - whom he'd met in Seattle. He wanted to marry her. But being a merchant seaman, at that time, was not a career considered respectable enough, according to David Lindstrom.<br>
The Rev. Lindstrom, raised in the Swedish Baptist Church, acquired deep religious convictions. So he decided to become a pastor. He enrolled at the Eastern Baptist Theological Seminary in Pennsylvania.<br>
All the while, he continued to court Gustafson. Once he hitchhiked and rode the rails all the way to Seattle for a visit, according to his son. In 1935, the Rev. Lindstrom finally married Gustafson; they had three children and shared 65 years of marriage.<br>
In their early years together, he worked as a pastor at several small churches in New Jersey. Then he signed up for duty as an Army-Air Force chaplain during World War II, continuing to serve through the Korean War.<br>
After leaving the service, the Rev. Lindstrom served as a pastor in many small Washington communities, including Kettle Falls, Oroville, Marcus, Burlington and Kittitas. He felt strongly that different denominations should get along, and he worked to bring different churches together in the small towns where he lived.<br>
He never gave up on education. In Kittitas, he enrolled at Central Washington State University and - at the age of 62 - received a master's degree in English literature.<br>
In 1985, the Rev. Lindstrom retired and settled with his wife in Kirkland. They moved to Covenant Shores in 1995; Eleanor Lindstrom died in 2001.<br>
The Rev. Lindstrom is survived by his daughter, Alice Lindstrom Davis of San Francisco; his son Carl David Lindstrom and daughter-in-law Sandra of Mercer Island; his son Dr. James Lindstrom and daughter-in-law Diane of Yakima; as well as six grandchildren. He also is survived by his cousin, Margaret Olson Pryne of Redmond. A graveside service will be at 10 a.m. Aug. 14 at Lake View Cemetery on Capitol Hill, with a memorial service at 2 p.m. at Covenant Shores Retirement Center. Memorial gifts can be made to a charity of choice.<br>
