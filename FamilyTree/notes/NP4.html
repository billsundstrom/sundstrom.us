Death of Mr. Alvah S. ALDEN at a ripe old age, occurred last evening.<br>
After a brief illness, Mr. Alvah S. ALDEN, an old and greatly respected citizen died at 7:00 o'clock last evening at his home, 64 Pittee Street, at the ripe old age of 82 years.<br>
The deceased was an excellent, consistant Christian gentleman and for years has been as a pillar in the Methodist church of this city. He was a clever, genial old gentleman and was highly esteemed by all who knew him--none thinking more of him than his closest neighbors and those who were brought the nearer to him in the daily walks of life.<br>
The deceased was born in Waterbury, VT Nov. 15, 1820. In 1845 he was united in marriage to Miss Sarah W. HOISINGTON, the marriage taking place in New York State--the wife of his youth still surviving him; besides whom there are two living children, Willaim H., and Minor I. ALDEN left to mourn his demise.<br>
Mr. ALDEN came to Battle Creek, MI in 1853 and has resided in the city ever since.<br>
The funeral will take place from the home on Saturday afternoon at 2:30, Rev. George B. KURP officiating.<br>
 27 February 1903<br>

<p>
<a name ="I086869"><b>[I086869]</b></a><br />
Betty Jane Alden was the daughter of Grace Isadora Taggart and Alfred Edward Fruin. Her mother remarried in the spring of 1921, and Betty was adopted by Minor Smith Alden, around that time. He was the only father she ever knew.<br>
Betty Jane married Jack Harvey Johnson on June 18, 1938 in Ohio.They started their family in Jackson, Michigan and had one daughter and three sons (one son is still living). <br>
In 1951 Jack, Betty, and the kids moved to Texas in search of work and warmer temperatures. They settled in Beaumont, Texas and all of the children graduated from French High School. After their children moved out away from home, Betty and Jack chose to end their marriage and remarried other people. She married W.C. Gardner in Jefferson County, and they lived in Beaumont. She later moved to the nearby city of Vidor. <br>
Betty worked as an assembly clerk for Rogers Enterprise in Beaumont. Her favorite color was orange, and she liked collecting rooster decor. She also enjoyed going to Jefferson Theatre to see concerts, plays, and other such performances and has a seat dedicated in her name. <br>
At the time of Betty's passing from cancer, she was being cared for by the staff at Lindberg Heath Center in Beaumont. Her memorial took place at Memorial Funeral Home in Vidor. She chose to donate her body to science with the hope that others may have a better future.<br>
She loved all of her family and friends dearly, and enjoyed hosting the family reunions and gatherings for everything from holidays to birthdays. She had an entire wall of her home set aside for photos of her children and their families, which she added to frequently. She also regularly kept in touch with her 3 half-sisters: Frances June (Brown) Askew, Marjorie "Marjie" (Brown) Ten Brink, and Priscilla "Jean" (Alden) Mathews. She will always be loved and missed by her family and friends.<br>

Cynthia Louisa ALDEN
<p>
<a name ="I003936"><b>[I003936]</b></a><br />
 Mrs. Cynthia L. Griffin, the aged mother of James F. Griffin, 1127 Monroe street, met her death on Saturday evening about 9 oʼclock by falling down the cellar stairs.<br>
   She had gone from her room through the dining room which was partly dark into the kitchen, unobserved by the family who were at the front of the house. In returning through the dining room she evidently missed the hall door and opened the one leading to the cellar instead. She was missed a short time later, and after a search, was found dead at the foot of the stairs with a deep cut upon her head and her neck was probably broken, so that death must have been nearly or quite instantaneous.<br>
   Mrs. Griffin lived in Topeka 32 years, and had three sons, James F. Griffin of Topeka; Joseph A. Griffin of Chicago, and Rev. P. M. Griffin, Matfield, Mass., and all will be present at the funeral, which will take place this afternoon at 5 oʼclock.<br>
   Mrs. Griffin, whose maiden name was Cynthia L. Alden, was born 88 years ago in Claremont, N. H., and was a lineal descendant of sixth generation of John Alden, of the Mayflower.<br>
   She was a member of the First Congregational church, and in years past was active in temperance and relief work.<br>

Judy Kay ALDEN
<p>
<a name ="I077165"><b>[I077165]</b></a><br />
Judy Kay Robinson, 67 VISTA -- Judy Kay Robinson died peacefully at her home in Vista, California on December 29, 2010. She is survived by her former husband, Ernest Robinson of Vista; daughter Julie Lynne (Robinson) Calfin, son-in-law, Matthew Calfin, and grandson, Carter Calfin of Carlsbad; and sister-in-law, Elissa Alden of Jackson, Mich. Judy Kay is remembered fondly for her generosity, strength of character, and love of learning. Judy Kay was born to Richard and Mildred Alden of Michigan Center, Mich., on March 16, 1943. From an early age, Judy Kay had an affinity for books and learning. Upon graduating from Michigan Center High School, she was the only member of the class of 1961 to attend university. Judy Kay loved Michigan State University, especially living in a dormitory, studying art history, and making ceramic pots. She graduated in 1965 and began the first chapter of her adult life as an Art Teacher in Jackson, Mich. On a trip to Orange County, Calif., she met her husband-to-be, Ernest Robinson, and the two were married in 1967. After making their home in Buena Park, Calif., she became a Kindergarten teacher and immediately loved her new job. She would often say with a laugh, "I can't believe they pay me to do this!" In 1973, she and her husband relocated to Vista, Calif., and she began the motherhood chapter of her life. She was a loving and devoted mother who delighted in her daughter. She later returned to the classroom in the Vista Unified School District where she served as the School Improvement Program resource teacher at Beaumont Elementary School and later the Gifted and Talented Education teacher at Olive and Beaumont Elementary Schools. Soon, she settled into her calling as a Kindergarten teacher at Casita Center for Technology, Science and Math where she taught among her friends for 20 years. After her divorce in 1992, Judy Kay began a new chapter of her life by buying a home and traveling the world with her friend, Cheryl Vinson. When in far-off places like China, Russia, or Australia, Judy Kay always said, "Can you believe a girl from Michigan Center is here?" Upon retirement in 2006, Judy Kay missed her students but thoroughly enjoyed being able to "do what I want to do when I want to do it." She spent her time reading, traveling, going to movies, meeting friends for a beer, and enjoying her one and only grandchild, Carter. Perhaps the greatest joy of her later years was being "Gram" to "the cutest and smartest child on the planet," as she would often describe Carter. In the final chapter of her life, she faced cancer with courage, grace, and no regrets. She died the way she lived---filled with love and concern for others. Her legacy as a mother, grandmother, and teacher is a testament to a life well lived. Judy Kay was preceded in death by her parents and her brother, Michael Alden of Jackson, Mich. Judy Kay will be interred on April 9, 2011 in Grass Lake, Mich. A private celebration of her life will be held in Carlsbad, Calif., and in Jackson, Mich. To honor her love of books, her family suggests a donation to the library at Casita Center for Technology, Science and Math. Please make checks payable to "Casita Center" and send them to: 260 Cedar Road, Vista, Calif. 92084. Sign the Guest Book online obits.nctimes.com<br>
