Linstroth Margaret Williams "Peg" Linstroth, 89, passed away peacefully on November 7, 2004. Born on May 21, 1915, she was the daughter of the late James T. and Louise H. Williams. Her father, a pioneer in the macaroni manufacturing industry, was the founder of the Minneapolis based Creamette Company. More than 60 years ago, Mr. Williams placed Peg's lovely face and reassuring smile on the familiar green box of the company's flagship line of elbow macaroni known to pasta aficionados as "Creamettes." Peg's visage continues to smile on consumers of Creamette pasta brands today. Peg served as a member of the Creamette Company Board of Directors and as a Trustee for the J. T. Williams Family Trust. Peg was a long-time member of Basilica of St. Mary in Minneapolis where she was baptized, received her first communion, was confirmed and married. Peg attended Basilica Grade School; St. Margaret's Academy and graduated Phi Beta Kappa from The College of St. Catherine in St. Paul. Until the end of her life, Peg had remained active in the alumnae associations of her beloved "schools." In addition, Peg supported numerous local charities including the Poor Clare Sisters.

Linstroth of West Palm Beach, Florida; daughter, Catherine L. Stewart of Alexandria, Minnesota; daughter, Margaret L. Francis and her husband Dr. Gary Francis of Bratenahl, Ohio; son, J. Thomas Linstroth and his wife Shirley Linstroth of Columbia Heights, Minnesota; son, Peter M. Linstroth of Edina Minnesota; and son, Paul J. Linstroth of Edina, Minnesota.

Ronald "Ron" Arthur Williams, age 62, of Wisconsin Rapids, Wisconsin died Sunday, May 10, 2020, on Motherʼs Day, at his home surrounded by his loving family.<br>
Ronald was born May 08, 1958, on Motherʼs Day, in Wisconsin Rapids, Wisconsin to Franklin I. and Verna E. (Pedersen) Williams. Ron graduated from Adams-Friendship High School in 1976. Ron then enlisted in the United States Marine Corps. He traveled to San Diego, Germany, and Colorado. He was honorably discharged in 1982. In 1979, he married Cindy Marti and they had two girls, Crystal and Amber. That marriage later ended in divorce. Ron then met and married Pat Krieg and was married in 1996. They later divorced. During that marriage, Ron started his own tree business called StumpX. He loved being outdoors and helping people out. The business started out with grinding stumps and eventually grew into a full-service tree business. Ron then met his fianceʼ, Paula West and they remodeled and created a happy, beautiful home in Wisconsin Rapids.<br>
Ron enjoyed hunting, fishing, watching real Nascar (not the virtual stuff), Green Bay Packers, Milwaukee Brewers, his grandsons, and being with his family. Ron was known for his carpentry skills, corny jokes and always making you laugh. He had the best times with his best friend Tim Renner, fixing things with his brothers and getting into mischief with his cousins. He was a great woodworker. Over the years he made countless little step stools for many children, that I am sure that they will cherish. He loved making bird feeders, and just little mind things out of wood to get you thinking. Ron loved to go deer hunting, and especially the past few years with his grandsons, Mayson & Myles and son in law, Larry. Ron also looking forward to his yearly fishing trip with Tim, Cindy, Mayson, Myles, and Paula up north. Fishing may not have always been the best, but lots of memories were made. Ron also loved going to Milwaukee Brewer games with Paula, Sierra, Lexi, Steve, Paul, and Dede. Ron enjoyed having "the kids" over for dinner every week.<br>

EMMETT WLLMARTH CIVIL WAR VETERAN<br>
Good Citizen of This County For Many Years Passed To His Final Reward At His Home In Sycamore, Saturday Night, Sept. 9.<br>
Emmett Willmarth, veteran of the Civil war and a resident of DeKalb county for over half a century, passed from this life at his home, 203 East Elm street, Sycamore, at about 11 o clock on Saturday night, Sept. 9, after a period of failing health extending over four years, and after being confined to the house for two months. <br>
Emmett Willmarth was born in Willett, Courtland county, N.Y. on August 1, 1847, a son of Galon and Charlotte (Osgood) Willmarth. The family resided in Chenango county, that state, for about six years, and when the son was ten years of age, they came to Illinois, and resided in Kendall and Will counties, this state. The son Emmett enlisted on his country's call and became corporal in the 147th Illinois Volunteer Infantry, and served in the Civil war with credit during that great conflict. After his discharge he resided for a year in LaSalle county and then came to DeKalb county and had always since made his home in Cortland township and Sycamore. For many years he was engaged in farming. He was united in marriage on May 28, 1873, to Miss Mary L. Scott of Cortland. She passed from this life October 21, 1905. To them were born four children of whom there are surviving Mesdames Willard Elliott of Elburn, Calvin Royce of Joliet and Arthur Kenyon of Elgin.<br>
In 1910 Mr. Willmarth was married to Mrs. Lottie Garbutt, and after a few years they moved from the farm east of this city to Sycamore, where they had since resided.<br>
He was a member of the Baptist church, Woodmen and Royal Neighbors.<br>
Besides the wife and daughters he leaves surviving seven grandchildren.<br>
Mr. Willmarth was a kindly agreeable citizen, the soul of honor, and performed conscientiously and to the best of his ability every duty to himself and his fellow men. He had a wide circle of friends. During his last illness, while confined to his home, he was an example of cheerfulness and patience and never complained. His death was sudden; he had been up and around his rooms only a short time before he sank back on his pillows in his last sleep; just as he had often wished he might go. <br>
There was a large attendance of friends and relatives at the funeral services which were held at the home this Tuesday afternoon, Rev. James O'May, pastor of the Methodist church, and Rev. J. W. Patterson, pastor of the Baptist church officiating. The interment was in the family lot in Ohio Grove cemetery.<br>
