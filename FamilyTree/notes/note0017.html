Hugh Bigod, 1st Earl of Norfolk (1095 - 1177) was born in Belvoir Castle, Leicestershire, England.<br />
 <br />
He was the second son of Roger Bigod (d. 1107), Sheriff of Norfolk, who founded the Bigod name in England. Hugh Bigod became a controversial figure in history, known for his frequent switching of loyalties and hasty reactions towards measures of authority. Hence the words bigot and bigotry.<br />
 <br />
Early years<br />
Hugh inherited large estates in East Anglia on the death of his brother William, who perished without issue in the sinking of the White Ship on November 26, 1119. He succeeded his aunt Albreda - and by extension, her eldest brother Berengar - as heir both to Berengar's tenancy-in-chief in Lincolnshire and the Norman lands of Robert de Tosny of Belvoirwas. He became Constable of Norwich Castle and Governor of the City of Norwich in 1122. He enjoyed the favour of Henry I.<br />
 <br />
During King Stephen's reign<br />
At first a supporter of Stephen of Blois during this king's struggle with the empress Matilda. His initiation in history was on the death of Henry I in 1135, when Maud expected to succeed to the throne of England, but her cousin, Stephen of Blois usurped the throne, breaking an oath he had previously made to defend her rights. It was Bigod who claimed that Henry I (Maud's father, and Stephen's uncle) intended for Stephen to become king at the expense of the empress. Civil War followed, but neither side seem to gain the upper hand. It was not until 1139 that Maud could command the military strength necessary to challenge Stephen within his own realm. Maud's greatest triumph came in April 1141, when her forces defeated and captured King Stephen, he was made a prisoner and effectively deposed. Her advantage lasted only a few months. In 1147, Maud was finally forced to return to France, following the death of Robert of Gloucester, her strongest supporter. Hugh is said to have supported Stephen during the conflict. On the death of king Henry he is said to have hastened to London and sworn an oath to the Archbishop that the dying king Henry had left the throne to Stephen of Blois over some quarrel with his daughter. For his actions he was rewarded with the Earldom of Norfolk before 1141.<br />
 <br />
King Stephen's new energy kept his followers together at first, but before long, in the next year Stephen was stricken with sickness. A lethargy fastened on him and the report of his death was quickly spread abroad. A rising of the turbulent barons necessarily followed, and Bigod was the first to take up arms. He seized and held Norwich; but Stephen, quickly recovering laid siege to the city and Hugh was compelled to surrender. Acting with unusual clemency, Stephen spared the rebel, who for a short time remained faithful. The open opposition of the Empress Matilda along with King Stephens's weak hand, gave in to a period of unrest later known as the "General Anarchy". Stephen's time was fully occupied in subduing the so-called adherents of the empress, who were really fighting for their own land.<br />
 <br />
In 1140 the Earl is said to have declared for the empress holding a siege in his castle of Bungay; yet in the next year he is in the ranks of Stephen's army fighting the disastrous Battle of Lincoln, after which the Earl deserted him and assumed a position of armed neutrality during the period of 'General Anarchy'.<br />
 <br />
Later, the disagreement between King Stephen and Archbishop Theobald in 1148, created yet another scenario for Hugh Bigod to come forward; this time, he sided with the archbishop, and received him in his Castle of Framlingham, but joined with others in effecting a reconciliation.<br />
 <br />
Rise of King Henry II<br />
Five years later, in 1153, when Henry, Duke of Anjou, soon to be King Henry II (r.1154 - 1189), landed in England to assert his claim to the throne, Bigod vested his interests with the rising power, and held out in Ipswich against Stephen's forces, while Henry II, on the other side, laid siege to Stamford. Both places fell. In the critical state of his fortunes Stephen was in no position to punish the rebel. Negotiations were also going on between the two parties, and Hugh again eluded retaliation.<br />
 <br />
On Henry II's accession in December 1154, Bigod at once received confirmation of the possession of his earldom and stewardship by charter issued apparently in January of the next year. The first years of the new reign were spent in restoring order to the shattered kingdom, and in breaking the power of the independent barons, which had grown out of control during King Stephen's reign.<br />
 <br />
It was not before long that Bigod became agitated under the rule of law initiated by Henry. He grew restless with measures such as the scutage, a fee paid by vassals in lieu of military service, which became the central feature of Henry II's military system of operation by 1159. The Earl showed signs of resistance, but was at once put down. In 1157 Henry II marched into the eastern counties and received the earl's submission.<br />
 <br />
After this incident Hugh Bigod makes no significant appearances in the chronicles for some time; he is named among those who had been excommunicated by Becket, in consequence of his retention of lands belonging to the monastery of Pentney in Norfolk.<br />
 <br />
The Revolt of 1173<br />
In 1173 the young crowned prince Henry (also known as Henry the Young King), raised a revolt against his father, Henry II. This gave Hugh Bigod, yet another chance for rebellion, along with the league of the English barons with the kings of France and Scotland in his favor. He at once became a leader in the cause, perhaps eager to revive the feudal power, which Henry II had curtailed. In addition to the fact that the inevitable conflict, as far as England was concerned, centered round his possesions. The custody of Norwich Castle was promised by the young prince as his reward.<br />
 <br />
The king's energy and good fortune were equal to the occasion. While he held in check his rebel vassals in France, the loyal barons in England defeated his enemies there. Robert de Beaumont, Earl of Leices (d.1190) landed at Walton, in Suffolk, on September 29, 1173 and marched to Framlingham, joining forces with Hugh. Together they besieged and took the castle of Hagenet in Suffolk on October 13, held by Randal de Broc for the crown. But the Earl of Leices was defeated and taken prisioner setting out from Framlingham at Fornham, St. Genevieve, near Bury by the justiciar, Richard de Lucy and other barons. These, then turned their arms against Earl Hugh, not strong enough to fight, he opened negotiations with his assailants. It is said he bought them off, and at the same time secured a safe passage home for the Flemings in his service.<br />
 <br />
Final days<br />
Though defeated and compelled to surrender his castles, Bigod kept his lands and his earldom, and lived at peace with Henry II until his death reportedly in 1177, in Palestine.<br />
 <br />
It should be noted, however, that on March 1st 1177, his son Roger Bigod appealed to the king on a dispute with his stepmother. Hugh being dead at this time, the date of his death is fixed 'ante caput jejunii,' (i.e. before March 9th). If, then, he died in Palestine, his death must have taken place in the preceding year, 1176, to allow time for the arrival of the news in England. Henry II took advantage of Roger's appeal to seize upon the late Earl's treasure. He possesed vast estates, which he inherited, and was also the recipient of the third penny levied in the county of Norfolk.<br />
 <br />
He married twice.<br />
 <br />
* In 1149 he married Juliane de Vere (1129-c.1199) born in Hedingham, Essex, England. She was Countess of Norfolk, the daughter of Aubrey de Vere, 2nd Earl of Oxford and Adeliza de Clare, a nun who was the daughter of Gilbert Fitz Richard de Clare, 2nd Earl of Clare. Their son:<br />
          o Roger Bigod (b.1150-1220), who would later become his succesor as 2nd Earl of Norfolk.<br />
 <br />
* His second wife was Gundreda Warwick (c.1135-1200), daughter of Roger, Earl of Warwick. They had two children:<br />
          o Hugh Bigod (b.1156)<br />
          o William Hugh (b.1168)<br />

Hugh Bigod (1186-1225) of Thetford, was the eldest son of Roger, Earl of Norfolk, and for a short time the 3rd Earl of Norfolk, Earl Marshall of England, and one of the 25 surites of Magna Carta of King John. He succeeded to his father's estates circa 1220, during the 5th year of the reign of King Henry III. (Richard Thomson: An Historical Essay on Magna Charta, London, 1829; Page 311.)<br />
 <br />
Hugh Bigod, the 3rd Earl of Norfolk, was one of the eight Barons who resisted the King's autocratic maladministration of the economy in what later became known as the barons war which was led by Simon de Montfort, Earl of Leicester, and brother-in-law to Henry III. The revolt now represents the most important demand for parliamentary democracy in England, called for by peers of the realm, after the events that led King John to sign Magna Charta.<br />
 <br />
Simon de Montfort was one of the 12 signitories of the 'April Confederacy', which represented the inception of the revolutionary movement, and one of the 24 authors of the 'Provisions of Oxford'. He was one of the 15 members of the privy council, along with Hugh Bigod and the earls of Gloucester and Hereford, Roger Mortimer, John fitz Geoffrey, Peter de Montfort, (not related to Simon), and the Bishop of Worcester. These barons thought fit to stand against the King and signed an oath to form a commune 'in which they swore to look after each others interests'. Richard de Clare, Earl of Gloucester, and Roger, then the Earl of Norfolk (Hugh Bigod's father), and Peter of Savoy signed the oath.<br />
 <br />
The conservative faction, led by Richard, Earl of Gloucester, supported the Provisions of Oxford and the Ordinance of the Sheriffs, but opposed the Provisions of Westminster. They wanted control over the king and his officials, but rejected a similar control over themselves and their agents. While many of the barons joined this alliance, Hugh Bigod, the justiciar, and Humphrey de Bohun, 2nd Earl of Hereford, remained neutral.<br />
 <br />
King Henry III's foreign advisors were compelled to leave the country, for fear of their lives, following the disruption that followed these events, but were met at the castle of the Bishop of Winchester, Aymer of Valance, one of the foreign advisors employed by Henry, and were besieged by the Barons. The Barons confederaton, lead by Hugh Bigod, banished the French from the country, confiscating their castles issuing a stern warning not to return.<br />
 <br />
De Montfort had the support of the Earl of Gloucester, the 'Cinque Ports', and the citizens of London, besides most of the lesser nobility, and controlled the south of the country. In May 1264, Leicester discovered the king was camped at Lewes, and on 14th, attacked and won the Battle of Lewes, capturing Henry, his brother the Prince Edward, Richard of Cornwall and Henry of Almain.<br />
 <br />
Simon De Montfort later was killed at the Battle of Evesham, but the revolt continued until July of 1267 with small pockets of resistance remaining in different parts of the country.<br />

Taksony (c. 905 - 970) (Slovak: Taksonn) was the fejedelem (rulingprince) of Hungary between 955 and 970. We have few details on his life.His father was Zoltan of Hungary.<br />
 <br />
Taksony's policies were a change from the previous habit of the Hungarian leaders of conducting rapid raids on neighbouring countries, as he was probably present at the Battle of Lechfeld, where the Hungarian army was defeated and lost its leader Bulcs√∫. Relations with the Byzantine Empire progressively deteriorated, possibly due to progaganda from the Holy Roman Emperor Otto who depicted the Hungarians as ungodly. In the second half of his reign Taksony increasingly pursued campaigns against Byzantine Empire. Although Taksony asked the pope to send a bishop to Hungary (a request which was thwarted by Otto), he didn't follow an open policy to the spreading of Christianity within his realm.<br />
 <br />
Taksony arranged the marriage of his son G√©za to Sarolt, the daughter of the Gyula of Transylvania. He also had a son called Michael.<br />

He married twice; first to Sophia von Looz, daughter of the Count of Looz, and secondly to Synadene, a niece of Emperor Nicephorus III. By his first marriage, he had two children:<br />

Scotts Bay.<br />
The death occurred at Scott ºs Bay on May 16th last of Noble Corkum, aged 53 years. Deceased was born in Pereaux. He was converted eighteen years ago and joined the Baptist church at that place, of which the Rev. David Freeman was, at that time pastor. He had for six years been afflicted with asthma which at last developed into consumption. During the latter part of his sickness he suffered very much, but bore it all with Christian fortitude. His daughter Carrie who had been living in Portland, ME, came home April 1st and cared for her father during the remainder of his illness. His son Burton, who was also in Maine, arrived home only two days before his father ºs death. The day before he died he requested the family to sing "Life is the time to serve the Lord," and "On Christ, the Solid Rock, I Stand." He listened throughout with rapt attention, murmuring at the close, "Oh, how blessed!" The funeral took place on Sunday, 18th. The remains were taken into the church at Scotts Bay, where a touching and impressive service was conducted by Rev. Allen Corbett. After the sorrowing relatives and friends had taken their farewell look at the remains, the interment took place in Scotts Bay cemetery. The funeral was largely attended, more than fifty carriages following the remains to the church. Deceased leaves a widow, nine children, and aged father and mother, one sister and five brothers to mourn their loss. While deepest sympathy is felt for the sorrowing family, we greatly rejoice with them that his sleep is in God.<br />

Baldwin I (1172 - 1205), the first emperor of the Latin Empire of Constantinople, as Baldwin IX Count of Flanders and as Baldwin VI Count of Hainaut, was one of the most prominent leaders of the Fourth Crusade, which resulted in the capture of Constantinople, the conquest of the greater part of the Byzantine Empire, and the foundation of the Latin Empire, also known as Romania (not to be confused with modern Romania).<br />
 <br />
Early life<br />
Baldwin was the son of Baldwin V of Hainaut, and Margaret I, sister of Philip of Alsace and Countess of Flanders. When Philip died childless in 1191, he was succeeded in Flanders by Baldwin V, who ruled as Baldwin VIII of Flanders by right of marriage.<br />
 <br />
In 1186, the younger Baldwin married Marie of Champagne, daughter of count Henry I of Champagne. The chronicler Gislebert describes Baldwin as being infatuated with his young bride, who nevertheless preferred prayer to the marital bed. Gislebert claims Baldwin was "tied only to one woman", his wife.<br />
 <br />
Through Marie, Baldwin had additional connections and obligations to the defenders of Holy Land: Her brother Henry II of Champagne had been King of Jerusalem in the 1190s (leaving a widow and two daughters who needed help to keep and regain their territories in Palestine). Marie's uncles Richard I of England and Philip II of France had just been on the Third Crusade.<br />
 <br />
Baldwin's own family had also been involved in defence of Jerusalem: his uncle Philip had died on Crusade. Baldwin's mother's mother was great-aunt of Isabella, Queen of Jerusalem and the Counts of Flanders had tried to help Jerusalem relatives in their struggle. Baldwin wanted to continue the tradition.<br />
 <br />
Margaret died in 1194, and the younger Baldwin became Count of Flanders. His father died the next year, and he succeeded to Hainaut.<br />
 <br />
Count of Flanders and Hainaut<br />
Baldwin took possession of a much-reduced Flanders, for his uncle had given a large chunk, including Artois, as dowry to Baldwin's sister Isabelle of Hainaut on her marriage to King Philip II of France, and another significant piece to his own wife. Isabelle had died in 1190, but King Philip still retained her dowry, on behalf of Isabella's son, the future Louis VIII of France. The eight years of Baldwin's rule in Flanders were dominated by his attempts to recover some of this land, culminating in January 1200 in the Treaty of P√©ronne, in which Philip returned most of Artois.<br />
 <br />
In this fight against the French king, Baldwin allied with others who had quarrels with Philip, including kings Richard I and John of England, and the German King Otto IV.<br />
 <br />
A month after the treaty, on February 23, 1200, Baldwin took the cross (committed to embark on the Fourth Crusade). He spent the next two years preparing, finally leaving on April 14, 1202.<br />
 <br />
As part of his effort to leave his domains in good order, Baldwin issued two notable charters for Hainaut. One detailed an extensive criminal code, and appears to be based on a now-lost charter of his father. The other laid down specific rules for inheritance. These are an important part of the legal tradition in Belgium.<br />
 <br />
Baldwin left behind his two-year-old daughter and his pregnant wife, Countess Marie. By early 1204, she had left both her children behind to join him in the East. They expected to return in a couple of years, but in the end neither would see their children or their homeland again.<br />
 <br />
Marie was regent for Baldwin for the two years she remained in Flanders and Hainaut. Afterward, Baldwin's younger brother Philip of Namur was regent and also had custody of the daughters. Baldwin's uncle William of Thy (an illegitimate son of Baldwin IV of Hainaut) was regent for Hainaut.<br />
 <br />
Meanwhile, the crusade had been diverted to Constantinople, where the crusaders had captured and sacked the city, and decided to set up a Latin empire in place of the fallen Greek one.<br />
 <br />
Latin Emperor<br />
The imperial crown was offered to, and refused by, Enrico Dandolo, Doge of Venice. The choice then lay between Baldwin and Boniface of Montferrat. Baldwin was elected on May 9, 1204, and crowned on May 16. He was young, gallant, pious, and virtuous, one of the few who interpreted and observed his crusading vows strictly; the most popular leader in the host.<br />
 <br />
Baldwin's wife Marie, unaware of these events, had sailed to Acre. There she learned of her husband's election as emperor, but died of the plague in August 1204 before she could join him.<br />
 <br />
The Latin Empire was organized on feudal principles; the emperor was feudal superior of the princes who received portions of the conquered territory. His own special portion consisted of the city of Constantinople, the adjacent regions both on the European and the Asiatic side, along with some outlying districts, and several islands including Lemnos, Lesbos, Chios and Tenos. The territories still had to be conquered; and first of all it was necessary to break the resistance of the Greeks in Thrace and secure Thessalonica. In this enterprise in the summer of 1204, Baldwin came into collision with Boniface of Montferrat, the rival candidate for the empire, who was to receive a large territory in Macedonia with the title of King of Salonica. He hoped to make himself quite independent of the empire, to do no homage for his kingdom, and he opposed Baldwin's proposal to march to Thessalonica. The antagonism between Flemings and Lombards aggravated the quarrel. Baldwin insisted on going to Thessalonica; Boniface laid siege to Adrianople, where Baldwin had established a governor; civil war seemed inevitable. An agreement was effected by the efforts of Dandolo and the count of Blois. Boniface received Thessalonica as a fief from the emperor, and was appointed commander of the forces which were to march to the conquest of Greece.<br />
 <br />
During the following winter (1204-1205) the Franks prosecuted conquests in Bithynia, in which Henry, Baldwin's brother, took part. But in February the Greeks revolted in Thrace, relying on the assistance of John (Kaloyan), king of Bulgaria, whose overtures of alliance had been rejected by the emperor. The garrison of Adrianople was expelled. Baldwin along with Dandolo, the count of Blois, and Marshal Villehardouin, the historian, marched to besiege that city. The Bulgarian king led to its relief an army which far outnumbered that of the crusaders. The Frank knights fought desperately, but were defeated (April 14, 1205); the count of Blois was slain, and the emperor captured (see Battle of Adrianople).<br />
 <br />
For some time his fate was uncertain, and in the meanwhile Henry, his brother, assumed the regency. Not till the middle of July was it definitely ascertained that he was dead. It seems that he was at first treated well as a valuable hostage, but was sacrificed by the Bulgarian monarch in a sudden outburst of rage, perhaps in consequence of the revolt of Philippopolis, which passed into the hands of the Franks. According to a Bulgarian legend, Baldwin tried to seduce Kaloyan's wife. One contemporary writer says that his hands and feet were cut off, and he was thrown into a valley where he died on the third day; but the manner of his death is not confidently known. King John himself wrote to Pope Innocent III, reporting that Baldwin had died in prison. A tower of the fortress of Veliko Turnovo is still called "Baldwin's Tower".<br />
 <br />
Children and Successors<br />
It was not until July 1206 that the Latins in Constantinople had reliable information that Baldwin was dead. His brother Henry was crowned emperor in August.<br />
 <br />
Back in Flanders, however, there seemed to be doubt whether Baldwin was truly dead. In any case, Baldwin's other brother Philip of Namur remained as regent, and eventually both of Baldwin's daughters Jeanne and Margaret were to rule as countesses of Flanders.<br />

Boleslaw I Chrobry ('Boleslaus the Brave') (966/967 - 1025) of the Piastfamily, son of Mieszko I and of his first wife, the Czech princessDobrawa, ruled as duke of Poland from 992 to 1025 and reigned as King ofPoland in 1025.<br />
 <br />
Boleslaus's Career<br />
In 984 Boleslaus married Rikdaga, the daughter of Riddag (Rikdag, Ricdag), the margrave of Meissen. Subsequently he married Judith, the daughter of Geza the Great Prince of Hungary; then Enmilda, the daughter of one Dobromir, a Lusatian prince; and Oda, daughter of the margrave of Meissen. His wives bore him sons including Bezprym, Mieszko II and Otton; and a daughter, Mathilde. After death of his father around 992 he was able to expel the second wife of his father, Oda, with her sons, and unite the country again.<br />
 <br />
In 997 Boleslaus sent Saint Adalbert of Prague to Prussia on the Baltic Sea to attempt to convert the Prussians to Christianity. By this time he already possessed Silesia and Pomerania (with its main city of Gdansk and Little Poland (with its main city of Cracow). In 999 he annexed present-day Moravia and in 1000 or 1001 Slovakia.<br />
 <br />
In A.D. 1000, while on a pilgrimage to the tomb of St. Adalbert at Gniezno, the emperor Otto III invested Boleslaus with the title Frater et Cooperator Imperii ("Brother and Partner of the Empire"). Some historians say that the emperor also pledged the king's crown to Boleslaus. On the same visit Otto III accepted Gniezno's status as an archbishopric. For the consequences see the article on the meeting at the tomb of Saint Adalbert.<br />
 <br />
After the untimely death of Otto III in 1002 at the age of 22, Boleslaus conquered Meissen and Lusatia, in an attempt to wrest imperial territory for himself during the disputes over the throne; he and his father had both backed Henry the Wrangler against Otto earlier, and he accepted the accession of Henry II of Germany, the earlier Henry's son.<br />
 <br />
Boleslaus conquered and made himself duke of Bohemia and Moravia in 1003 - 1004; he defeated the Ruthenians and stormed Kyiv in 1018, annexing the Red Strongholds (Grody Czerwienskie) later called Red Ruthenia and making prince Sviatopolk his vassal there. The intermittent wars with Germany ended with the Peace of Bautzen, Budziszyn in 1018, which left Sorbian Meissen and Lusatia in Polish hands.<br />
 <br />
The emperor Henry II obliged Boleslaus to give a pledge of allegiance again for the lands he held in fief. After the death of Henry in 1024, Boleslaus crowned himself king, raising Poland to the rank of kingdom (1025).<br />
 <br />
The son of Boleslaus, Mieszko II crowned himself immediately after his father's death.<br />
 <br />
Boleslaus sent an army to aid his friend, or more probably to his nephew, Canute in his conquest of England.<br />
 <br />
Boleslaus was the first Polish King, since during his rule Poland became a Kingdom, despite the fact that some of the Polish rulers before 1295 never received a crown. He was the first Polish ruler baptised at birth, the first real Christian ruler. He founded the independent Polish province of the church and made Poland a strong power in Europe. Boleslaus for the first time unified all the provinces that subsequently came to comprise the traditional territory of Poland: Greater Poland, Little Poland, Masovia, Silesia and Pomerania. For the Sorbs of Lusatia he became the national hero.<br />

Mieszko II Lambert, also spelled as Miezko II, was the duke andshort-term king of Poland (990 - 1034). He was the son of Boleslaw IChrobry and Enmilda, the daughter of Dobromir Duke of Lusatia. Theirchildren were Casimir I of Poland, Rixa of Poland, and Gertrude of Poland.<br />
 <br />
Mieszko II was very well educated for the period. He was able to read and write, and knew both Greek and Latin. He is (unjustly) known as Mieszko Gnus'ny which means Lazy, Stagnant or Slothful. He received that name because of the most unfortunate end of his rule; but at the start, he acted as a skillful and talented ruler. Before he became king in 1025, he probably ruled as his father's governor in Krak√≥w, most likely since 1013, when he supposedly built many churches.<br />
 <br />
He waged war against Germany (starting in 1028), quite successfully: he was able to repel the German army, and later he even invaded Saxony. He allied with Hungary, resulting for a while in the Hungarian occupation of Vienna. This war probably was because of family connections of Mieszko in opposition against emperor Conrad II in Germany.<br />
 <br />
To understand what happened later, it is necessary to understand Mieszko's family. His older brother, Bezprym, was the son of an unknown Hungarian wife of Boleslaw, who was later expelled by Boleslaw. He also had a younger brother, Otton. According to old Slavic custom, a father was supposed to divide his heritage between all his sons. However, since kingdoms can not be divided, Mieszko's brothers received nothing from their father's legacy. As Bezprym was the oldest son, many probably felt that he should have succeeded his father as king. However, Bezprym had always been disliked by his father, as denoted by his name (Piasts usually used names like Boleslaw, Mieszko, later also Kazimierz, Wladyslaw, or Emperor's names: Otton, Conrad, Heinrich: but Bezprym was a commoner's name, which implied that Boleslaw did not desire Bezprym to follow him in succession). He was sent to a monastery.<br />
 <br />
Both Mieszko's brothers escaped abroad: Otton to Germany, Bezprym to Kievan Rus. Soon after both the German emperor and the great duke of Kyiv, Yaroslav I the Wise, allied and made simultaneous invasions.<br />
 <br />
Facing two enemies, Germany from the west and Ruthenia from the east, Mieszko escaped to Bohemia where he was probably castrated. Bezprym started his rule by sending his crown and other king's insignia to Germany. Mieszko returned soon, but this time he was forced to pledge allegiance to the German Emperor, and Poland was divided between him, his brothers Otton and Bezprym, and a mysterious Thiedric (probably nephew or cousin). Otton was killed by one of his own men, and Mieszko was able to reunite Poland. What happened next is a great puzzle. Today modern historians think that Mieszko was killed in a plot organised by the aristocracy (1034).<br />
 <br />
After his death, the peasants revolted in the pagan reaction. The exact reasons and date are unknown. Casimir I of Poland, son of Mieszko, was either expelled by this uprising, or the uprising was caused by expelling by aristocracy. Modern historians argue that it was more probably caused by economical issues (huge new taxes for the Church, militarisation of early Polish dukedom/kingdom: almost all the male population were drafted to serve in the army etc.) than religious. Priests, monks and knights were killed; cities, churches and monasteries were burned. The chaos was even greater when the Czechs invaded unexpectedly from the south. The land became divided between local rulers, of whom one is known (Maslav, who ruled Mazovia). Greater Poland was so devastated that it ceased to be the core of the Polish kingdom. New Polish kings moved their capital to Little Poland, to Krak√≥w.<br />

Thierry d'Alsace (c. 1099 - January 1168), sometimes known as Derry or Dirk, was count of Flanders from 1128 to 1168. He was the youngest son of Duke Thierry II of Lorraine and Gertrude of Flanders.<br />
 <br />
After the murder of Charles the Good, Thierry was one the claimants for the county. Due to the support of King Louis VI of France, William Clito became count instead. Thierry succeeded after William's death in 1128.<br />
 <br />
His first wife, Suanhilde, died in 1133, leaving an only daughter, Laurette. Laurette of Flanders married four times: (1) Ivan, Count of Alost; (2) Henry II, Duke of Limburg; (3) Raoul I, Count of Vermandois; and (4) Henry I, Count of Luxembourg. Laurette finally retired to a nunnery, where she died in 1170.<br />
 <br />
Thierry secondly married Sibylle of Anjou, the former wife of William Clito. Their children were:<br />
   1. Philip of Flanders (died 1191)<br />
   2. Matthew of Alsace (died 1173), married Countess Marie of Boulogne<br />
   3. Margaret I of Flanders (died 1194), married Baldwin V, Count of Hainaut<br />
   4. Gertrude of Flanders (died 1186), married Humbert III of Savoy<br />
   5. Matilda, abbess of Fontevrault<br />
   6. Pierre, bishop of Cambrai (died 1176)<br />
 <br />
He was a noted Crusader, having undertaken four pilgrimages from 1139 to 1164. In 1139 he fought alongside his father-in-law Fulk V of Anjou at the invasion of Gilead. Afterwards he joined the Second Crusade, fighting at the Battle of Attalia in 1148; later that year he joined the assembly of King Baldwin III of Jerusalem at Acre. In 1164 he accompanied King Amalric I of Jerusalem to Antioch and Tripoli.<br />

Margaret II of Flanders (1202-1278) was countess of Flanders from 1244 to 1278 and countess of Hainaut from 1244 to 1246. Her coat of arms was "Chevronny or and sable".<br />
 <br />
Biography<br />
She was the younger daughter of Baldwin I of Constantinople, who was also count of Flanders and Hainaut, and Marie of Champagne. He left on the Fourth Crusade before she was born, and her mother left two years later, leaving Margaret and her older sister Jeanne in the guardianship of their uncle Philip of Namur.<br />
 <br />
After her mother died in 1204, and her father the next year, the now-orphaned Margaret and her sister remained under Philip's guardianship until 1208, when he gave their wardship to King Philip II of France.<br />
 <br />
In 1212 Margaret married Bouchard d'Avesnes, a prominent Hainaut nobleman. This was apparently a love match, though it was approved by Margaret's sister Jeanne, who had herself recently married. The two sisters subsequently had a falling out over Margaret's share of their inheritance, which led Jeanne to attempt to get Margaret's marriage dissolved. She alleged that the marriage was invalid, and without much inspection of the facts of the case Pope Innocent III condemned the marriage, though he did not formally annul it.<br />
 <br />
Bourchard and Margaret continued as a married couple, having two children, as their conflict with Jeanne grew violent and Bouchard was captured and imprisoned in 1219. He was released in 1221 on the condition that the couple separate and that Bouchard get absolution from the pope. While he was in Rome, Jeanne convinced Margaret to re-marry, this time to William of Dampierre, a nobleman from Champagne.<br />
 <br />
This situation caused something of a scandal, for the marriage was possibly bigamous, and violated the church's strictures on consanguinity as well. The disputes regarding the validity of the 2 marriages and the legitimacy of her children by each husband continued for decades, becoming entangled in the politics of the Holy Roman Empire.<br />
 <br />
In 1246 king Louis IX of France, acting as an arbitrator, gave the right to inherit Flanders to the Dampierre children, and the rights to Hainaut to the Avesnes children. This would seem to have settled the matter, but in 1253 problems arose again. The eldest son, John d'Avesnes was uneasy about his rights, convinced William II, Count of Holland to seize Hainaut and the parts of Flanders which were within the bounds of the empire. William of Holland was, as emperor-elect, overlord for these territories, and also John's brother-in-law. A civil war followed, which ended when the Avesnes forces defeated and imprisoned the Dampierres at the Battle of Walcheren.<br />

Fergus of Galloway was Lord of Galloway from about 1138 until his death in 1161. He was a noble in the court of King David I of Scotland, and may have been descended from earlier princes of Galloway. He accompanied David to the English court during David's tenure as Prince of Cumbria. His wife's name is unknown, but she may have been an illegitimate daughter of King Henry I of England. They had three children:<br />
   1. Uchtred of Galloway<br />
   2. Gilbert of Galloway<br />
   3. Aufrica of Galloway, married King Olaf I of the Isle of Man<br />
 <br />
Fergus was a prominent noble under King David, and was probably appointed Lord of Galloway after the Battle of the Standard in 1138. He built many religious houses, abbeys, and chapels all across Galloway, and enjoyed a peaceful reign until after King David's death. In 1160 Fergus rebelled against the new king, Malcolm IV of Scotland, and joined Somerled of Argyll in ravaging the west coast. Somerled and Fergus' rebellion was defeated in 1161; Somerled was slain in 1164, but Fergus had retired to the abbey of Holyroodhouse, where he became a canon regular and died shortly thereafter, leaving Galloway to his two sons.<br />

G√©za of Hungary (born around 940-945, died in 997) (possibly Gy√©csa inOld Hungarian, Gejza in Slovak), was the fejedelem (ruling prince) of theMagyars from c. 970 to 997.<br />
 <br />
G√©za was the son of Taksony, ruling prince of the Magyars and his Cuman wife, and was the great-grandson of √Årp√°d, who gave his name to the ruling dynasty. Although still a pagan when he became ruler, the alliance concluded between the Holy Roman Empire and Byzantium in 972 forced G√©za to convert to Christianity in order to secure a lasting peace for Hungary. He turned to the Holy Roman Emperor Otto I, who ordained a Benedictine monk, Bruno of Sankt Gallen, as bishop and sent him to Hungary to baptise G√©za (this occurred in 985 according to some sources). However, although he was mainly accepted as a Christian ruler it is doubtful that he was a Christian at heart. According to the Bishop of Merseburg he continued to worship pagan gods.<br />
 <br />
Although overshadowed by his son, King Stephen I of Hungary, G√©za made considerable achievements during his reign. He established centralised rule over the entire country, except for Transylvania which remained under the separate authority of the gyula. This allowed him to collect taxies and duties far more successfully than his predecessors and thus increase his personal wealth.<br />
 <br />
G√©za's wife was Sarolt, daughter of Gyula of Transylvania, and who was brought up as a Christian. G√©za had a brother named Michael (born in 955 at Esztergom), who became Regent of Poland and died about 978.<br />

Leopold I, also Luitpold or Liutpold, (died 994 in W√ºrzburg) was the first Margrave of √ñsterreich from the Babenberg dynasty.<br />
 <br />
Leopold was a count in the Bavarian Danube district and first appears in documents from the 960s as a faithful follower of Emperor Otto I the Great. After the insurgence by Henry II the Wrangler of Bavaria in 976 against Emperor Otto II, he was appointed as "markgrave in the East", the core territory of modern Austria, instead of a Burkhard. His residence was probably at P√∂chlarn, but maybe already Melk, where his successors resided. The territory, which originally had only coincided with the modern Wachau, was enlarged in the east at least as far as the Wienerwald.<br />
 <br />
Leopold is the first reasonably known historical figure in Austria. The milennial anniversary of his appointment as markgrave was therefor celebrated as Thousand years of Austria in 1976 - celebrations under the same title were held twenty years later at the anniversary of the famous Ostarrichi document first mentioning the Old German name of Austria.<br />
 <br />
Even though he is not mentioned in the Babenberger Chronicle written by his descendant Otto of Freising (which only starts with Leopold's grandson Adalbert) he is known as the progenitor of this dynasty, which put its stamp on Austria. Otto of Freising's claim of ancestry to the Franconian Babenbergers, who are remembered for the Babenberger insurgency of the early 10th century, has not been proven, but cannot be completely ruled out.<br />

Roger Bigod (d. 1107) was a Norman knight who came to England in the Norman Conquest. He held great power in East Anglia, and four of his descendants were Earl of Norfolk.<br />
 <br />
Roger came from a fairly obscure family of poor knights in Normandy. Robert le Bigot, who was probably Roger's father, acquired an important position in the household of William, duke of Normandy (later William I of England), due, the story goes, to his disclosure to the duke of a plot by the duke's cousin William of Mortain.<br />
 <br />
Robert or Roger, or perhaps even both, fought at the Battle of Hastings, and afterwards they were rewarded with a substantial estate in East Anglia. The Domesday Book lists Roger as holding 6 lordships in Essex, 117 in Suffolk and 187 in Norfolk.<br />
 <br />
Bigod's base was in Thetford, Norfolk where he founded a priory later donated to the great monastery at Cluny. In 1101 he further consolidated his power when Henry I granted him licence to build a castle at Framlingham, which became the family seat of power until their downfall in 1307. Two of the places associated with Roger Bigod are Framlingham and Bungay in Suffolk. Framlingham Castle and Bungay Castle were built and improved by successive generations.<br />
 <br />
In 1069 he, along with Robert Malet and Ralph de Gael (the then Earl of Norfolk), defeated Sweyn I of Denmark near Ipswich. After Ralph de Gael's fall in 1074, Roger was appointed Sheriff of Norfolk and Suffolk, and acquired many of the dispossessed earl's estates. For this reason he is sometimes counted as Earl of Norfolk, but he probably was never actually created earl. He acquired further estates through his influence in local law courts.<br />
 <br />
In the Rebellion of 1088 he joined other Anglo-Norman barons against William II, who, it was hoped, was to be deposed in favour of Robert Curthose, Duke of Normandy. He seems to have lost his lands after the rebellion had failed, but got them back again.<br />
 <br />
In 1101 there was another attempt to bring in Robert of Normandy by unseating Henry I, but this time Roger Bigod stayed loyal to Henry.<br />
 <br />
He died on September 9, 1107 and is buried in Norwich. Upon his death there was a dispute between the Bishop of Norwich, Herbet Losinga and the monks at Thetford, the priory founded by Bigod. The monks claimed that Roger's body, along with those of his family and successors, was due to them as part of the foundation charter of the priory (as was common practice at the time). The issue was apparently resolved when the Bishop of Norwich stole the body in the middle of the night and dragged it back to Norwich.<br />
 <br />
For some time he was thought to have two wives, Adelaide/Adeliza and Alice de Tosny. It is now believed these were the same woman, Adeliza(Alice) de Tosny(Toeni,Toeny). She was the sister and coheiress of William de Tosny, Lord of Belvoir.<br />
 <br />
He was succeeded by his eldest son, William Bigod, and, after he drowned in the sinking of the White Ship, by his second son, Hugh Bigod, who later became Earl of Norfolk. He also had 3 daughters: Gunnor, who married Robert, Lord of Rayleigh; Cecily, who married William d'Albini "Brito"; and Maud, who married William d'Albini "Pincerna", earl of Arundel.<br />

This history was written as a part of the Eureka Township Centennial 1954<br />
 <br />
The building of the Dodd road, from Fort Snelling to Saint Peter, passing through Eureka Township, played an important part in the settlement of the town. Early in the fifties, hopes were high throughout Minnesota, that Saint Peter was the coming city of the new territory.<br />
 <br />
In May of 1853, the Kingsley brothers, Cyrus, Dwight, and Ancil, under the direction of a Captain Dodd, began work on this territorial road. By the latter part of June, their work had brought them to a portion of the road, afterward included within the boundaries of Eureka Township. When at the point (now in section 7), where the Dodd road crosses the Vermillion River, Captain Dodd was so impressed with the loveliness of the spot he told Cyrus Kingsley to build a log pen and stakeout a claim of one hundred and sixty acres for him. His interest was short lived, for he soon forgot his claim as his work carried him along the new road. However, his fellow workers, the Kingsley brothers, could not forget.<br />
 <br />
While spending the winter of 1853-54 in St. Paul, where they built the city's first foundry buildings, the brothers met an old friend from the east, Benjamin Caskey, who was looking for a good location. Impressed with the Kingsleys description of lands waiting to be taken along the Dodd road, Caskey set out alone, in May, on a prospecting tour. As chance would have it, he settled on the exact claim staked out the year before by Captain Dodd.<br />
 <br />
A few weeks later, two of the Kingsley brothers, Cyrus, and Dwight came down the road to be Caskeys neighbors, even sharing his cabin for a time. For the first house, in Eureka, was built by Cyrus Kingsley and Benjamin Caskey on the latters claim during July 1854. In terms of today, this first cabin was located near the home of Mr. and Mrs. Harold Pool, present owners of the old claim.<br />
 <br />
The cabin was typical of those days, built of logs and about fourteen by eighteen feet in dimensions. For beds, wooden pins were driven into the logs and slabs or poles were laid upon them. A foot or so of wild hay completed the crude beds. The nearest neighbors were a camp of fifteen lodges of Dakota Indians.<br />
 <br />
That summer, Dwight Kingsley brought his wife from St. Paul and they soon built a cabin on Dwight's claim in the southeast quarter of section 6. Since both claims were located near the Dodd, the only road through the area, Alexander Faribault and other important personages, as well as the most humble of early pioneers shared the warm hearted hospitality of Eureka's first citizens, the Caskeys and the Kingsleys.<br />
 <br />
Writing for the Dakota County Tribune in 1904, Dwight Kingsley, then living in Minneapolis, told this about Old Days in Eureka:<br />
 <br />
"I am one of the first settlers of Eureka Township and the only one now alive that first settled in Eureka. At the beginning, my brother Ancil R. and Cyrus M., with myself, worked cutting the Dodd road through, under the direction of Captain Dodd. We worked from May 3rd to June 20th, 1853, then went across country to what is now Union Lake. We followed the Indian trail to Black Dog and came to St. Paul by way of Mendota. I never received one cent for my work on the Dodd from Captain Dodd or anyone else. I went east and married Ellen Caskey and made for Minnesota again, as I thought the winter was the nicest I ever saw. I came back with my wife in the spring of 1854, on April 13, my birthday, and reached St. Paul in ten days. Stayed there until July and then made a break for a farm and I settled in Eureka at the head of the Vermillion River. It was as handsome a stream as I ever knew. My partners were Ben Caskey and wife. In the course of two or three months, I found I had some neighbors about three miles from me at Chub Lake by the name of Peter Sampson. They had some cows and two horses. In the spring of 1855, James Caskey came in. He had left his wife behind and soon got sick of farming and sold out to his brother Henry.<br />
 <br />
I built a shanty on land Joseph Mallery now owns. There were a good many people traveling to Faribault. They used to stop with us sometimes and we had them lying on the floor two or three thick."<br />
 <br />
On July 18, 1854, Peter Sampson and his son Magnus; Ole Torrison and Ole H. Oleson Halling, all Norwegians, arrived at Chub Lake, from Wisconsin. Mr. Sampson took a claim in section 22 and 27. The Torrisons and Olesons located claims in section 21.<br />
 <br />
During the fall of that year, Peter Sampson and Ole Torrison built cabins on their claims. These two cabins, with those of Benjamin Caskey and Dwight Kingsley, making four in all, were the only houses in Eureka in 1854.<br />
 <br />
The summer of '54 also brought Slyvester Bell to the community. To him goes the credit for breaking the first land in the township, during the summer of 1854, on his claim in section 5. He broke about five acres with a plow drawn by oxen. Corn and a little wheat were planted. The wheat was cut with a cradle, tied in bundles with grass. It was used for hay.<br />
 <br />
Ancil Kingsley arrived in December of 1854 and took a claim in the southwest quarter of section 6, next to his brother Dwight.<br />

Eleanor of Aquitaine (Bordeaux, France, c. 1122 - March 31, 1204 in Fontevrault, Anjou) was one of the wealthiest and most powerful women in Europe during the Middle Ages. She was Queen consort of both France and England in her lifetime.<br />
 <br />
Biography<br />
Childhood<br />
The eldest of three children, her father was William X, Duke of Aquitaine, and her mother was √Ünor de Ch√¢tellerault, the daughter of Aimeric I, Vicomte of Chatellerault. William and √Ünor's marriage had been arranged by his father, William IX of Aquitaine the Troubador, and her mother, Dangereuse, William IX's long-time mistress. Eleanor was named after her mother and called Ali√©nor, which means other Aenor in the langue d'oc, but it became El√©anor in the northern langue d'oil and in English.<br />
 <br />
She was raised in one of Europe's most cultured courts, the birthplace of courtly love. She was highly educated for a woman of the time, and knew how to read, how to speak Latin, was well versed in music and literature, and enjoyed riding, hawking, and hunting. She became heiress to Aquitaine, the largest and richest of the provinces that would become modern France, when her brother, William Aigret, died as a baby.<br />
 <br />
Power and Marriage to Louis VII of France<br />
William X died on Good Friday, 1137 while on a pilgrimage to Spain. At about 15, Eleanor was now Duchess of Aquitaine, and the most eligible heiress in Europe. As these were the days when kidnapping an heiress was seen as a viable option for attaining title, William wrote a will on the very day he died, instructing that his daughter marry Louis VII of France. The marriage, on July 22, 1137, brought to France the area from the river Loire to the Pyrenees: most of what is today the southwest of France. However, there was a catch: the land would remain independent of France, and Eleanor's eldest son would be both King of France and Duke of Aquitaine. Thus, her holdings would not be merged with France until the next generation. She gave him a wedding present that is still in existence, a rock crystal vase on display at the Louvre. Within a month of their marriage, Louis VI died, and Eleanor became Queen of France.<br />
 <br />
Something of a free spirit, Eleanor was not much liked by the staid northerners (particularly, according to sources, her mother-in-law, Ad√©laide de Maurienne), who thought her flighty and a bad influence. Her conduct was repeatedly criticized by Church elders (particularly Bernard of Clairvaux and Abbot Suger) as indecorous. The King, on the other hand, was madly in love with his beautiful and worldly wife, and granted her every whim, even though her behavior baffled and vexed him to no end.<br />
 <br />
Crusade<br />
When Eleanor supported her sister Petronilla of Aquitaine's illegitimate marriage to Raoul of Vermandois, the incident started a war and caused conflict between Eleanor and Louis. She insisted on taking part in the Crusades as the feudal leader of the soldiers from her duchy. The story that she and her ladies dressed as Amazons is disputed by serious historians. However, her testimonial launch of the Second Crusade from V√©zelay, the rumored location of Mary Magdalene's burial, dramatically emphasized the role of women in the campaign, with her, the Queen of France, as their leader.<br />
 <br />
The Crusade itself was something of a disaster. Louis was a weak and ineffectual military leader with no concept of maintaining troop discipline or morale, or of making informed and logical tactical decisions. The French army was betrayed by Manuel I Comnenus, Byzantine Emperor, who feared that their aims would jeopardize the tenuous safety of his empire. A particularly poor decision to camp one night in a lush valley surrounded by tall peaks in hostile territory lead to an attack by the Turks, who slaughtered as many as 7000 Crusaders. As this decision was made by Eleanor's servant, it was generally believed that it was her directive; this did nothing for her popularity in Christendom.<br />
 <br />
Divorce to Louis<br />
Even before the Crusade, Eleanor and Louis were becoming estranged. The city of Antioch had been annexed by Bohemond of Hauteville in the First Crusade, and it was now ruled by her flamboyant uncle, Raymond of Antioch (rumored to be her lover), who had gained the principality by marrying its reigning Princess, Constance of Antioch. Clearly, Eleanor supported his desire to re-capture the nearby County of Edessa, the cause of the Crusade. Louis was directed by the Church to visit Jerusalem instead. When Eleanor declared her intention to stand with Raymond and the Aquitaine forces, Louis had her brought out by force. His long march to Jerusalem and back north debilitated his army, but her imprisonment disheartened her knights, and the divided Crusade armies could not overcome the Muslim forces. For reasons unknown, likely the Germans' insistence on conquest, the Crusade leaders targeted Damascus, an ally until the attack. Failing in this attempt, they retired to Jerusalem, and then home.<br />
 <br />
When they passed through Rome on the way to Paris, Pope Eugene III tried to reconcile Eleanor and Louis. Eleanor conceived their second daughter, Alix of France (their first was Marie), but there was no saving the marriage. In 1152; it was annulled on the grounds of consanguinity. Her estates reverted to her and were no longer part of the French royal properties.<br />
 <br />
However, it was while in the eastern Mediterranean, Eleanor learned about maritime conventions developing there: the beginnings of what would become admiralty law. She introduced those conventions in her own lands, on the island of Oleron in 1160, and then into England. She was also instrumental in developing trade agreements with Constantinople and ports of trade in the Holy Lands.<br />
 <br />
Marriage to Henry II of England<br />
On May 18, 1152, six weeks after her annullment, Eleanor married Henry Plantagenet, Count of Anjou and Duke of Normandy. She was about 11 years older than he, and related to him in the same degree as she had been to Louis. One of Eleanor's rumored lovers was Henry's own father, Geoffrey of Anjou, who, not surprisingly, advised him not to get involved with her. Over the next 13 years, she bore Henry five sons and three daughters: William, Henry, Richard, Geoffrey, John, Matilda, Eleanor, and Joan.<br />
 <br />
Despite her reputation (which all the historical evidence shows was probably deserved), Eleanor was incensed by Henry's philandering; their son, William, and Henry's bastard son, Geoffrey, were born months apart. Henry fathered other bastard children throughout most of their marriage.<br />
 <br />
Some time between 1168 and 1170, she instigated a separation, deciding to establish a new court in her own territory of Poitou. In Poitiers, she reached the height of her powers creating the Court of Love. A small fragment of her codes and practices was written by Andreas Capellanus.<br />
 <br />
Henry concentrated on controlling his increasingly-large empire, badgering Eleanor's subjects in attempts to control her patrimony of Aquitaine and her court at Poitiers. Straining all bounds of civility, Henry had Archbishop Thomas Becket murdered at the altar of the church in 1170 (to be fair, there is debate as to if it truly was Henry's intent to be rid of his Archbishop once and for all). This aroused not only Eleanor's horror and contempt, but most of Europe's.<br />
 <br />
Revolt and imprisonment<br />
In 1173, aggrieved at his lack of power and egged on by his father's enemies, the younger Henry launched the Revolt of 1173-1174, joined by Richard and Geoffrey, and supported by several powerful English barons, as well as Louis VII and William I of Scotland. When Eleanor tried to join them, she was intercepted. Henry, who put down the rebellion, imprisoned her for the next 15 years, much of the time in various locations in England. About four miles from Shrewsbury and close by Haughmond Abbey is "Queen Eleanor's Bower," the remains of a triangular castle which is believed to have been one of her prisons.<br />
 <br />
Henry lost his great love, Rosamund Clifford, in 1176. He had met her in 1166 and begun the liaison in 1173, supposedly contemplating divorce from Eleanor. When Rosamund died, rumours flew that Eleanor poisoned her, but there is no evidence to support this.<br />
 <br />
In 1183, Henry the Young tried again. In debt and refused control of Normandy, he tried to ambush his father at Limoges. He was joined by troops sent by his brother Geoffrey and Philip II of France. Henry's troops besieged the town, forcing his son to flee. Henry the Young wandered aimlessly through Aquitaine until he caught dysentery and died. The rebellion petered out.<br />
 <br />
Upon Henry's death in 1189, Eleanor helped her son Richard I to the throne, and he released her from prison. She ruled England as regent while Richard went off on the Third Crusade. She personally negotatied his ransom by going to Germany. She survived him and lived long enough to see her youngest son John on the throne.<br />
 <br />
Eleanor died in 1204 and was entombed in Fontevraud Abbey near her husband Henry and son Richard. Her tomb effigy shows her reading a Bible. She was the patroness of such literary figures as Wace, BenoÃÇƒ±t de Sainte-More, and Chr√©tien de Troyes.<br />

Amongst the most distinguished companion in arms of the Conqueror wasRobert de Todeni, a nobleman of Normandy, upon whom the victoriousmonarch conferred, with numerous other grants, an estate in the county ofLincoln upon the borders of Leicestershire. Here de Todeni erected astately castle and, from the fair view it commanded, gave it thedesignation of Belvoir Castle, and here he established his chief abode.At the time of the General Survey, this powerful personage possessed noless than eighty extensive lordships, viz., two in Yorkshire, one inEssex, four in Suffolk, one in Cambridge, two in Hertfordshire, three inBucks, four in Gloucestershire, three in Bedfordshire, nine inNorthamptonshire, two in Rutland, thirty-two in Lincolnshire, andseventeen in Leicestershire. "of this Robert," saith Dugdale, "I have notseen any other memorial than that the Coucher-Book of Belvoir recordeth:which is, that bearing a venerable esteem to our sometime much celebratedprotomartyr, St. Alban, he founded near to his castle a priory for monksand annexed it as a cell to that great abbey in Hertfordshire, formerlyerected by the devout King Offa in honour of that most holy man." Robertde Todeni, Lord of Belvoir, d. in 1088, leaving issue by his wife Adela,William, who assumed the surname of Albini; Berenger; Geoffrey; Robert;and Agnes. He was s. by his eldest son, William de Albini, Brito, Lord ofBelvoir.

Baldwin VI of Flanders (1030 - July 17, 1070) was briefly Count ofFlanders, from 1067 to 1070. He was also (as Baldwin I) count of Hainautfrom 1051 to 1070.<br />
 <br />
He was the eldest son of Baldwin V of Flanders and Adela Capet, a daughter of king Robert I of France.<br />
 <br />
In 1051 he married Richilda, widow of count Hermann I of Hainaut. Flanders had taken control of Hainaut, but it was only by this marriage that possession was really secured.<br />
 <br />
Baldwin's early death left Flanders and Hainaut in the hands of his young son Arnulf III, with Richilda as regent. The countship was soon usurped by Baldwin's brother Robert the Frisian, who became count Robert I of Flanders. The young Arnulf III was killed the next year at the Battle of Cassel, and Baldwin's younger son eventually became Baldwin II of Hainaut.<br />

Edmund Wright was another of our oldest graduates, belonging to the fourth class. He was born at Easthampton, Mass., on July 1, 1808 (almost four years before Dr. Thompson).  His college training was at Williams in the class of 1836, and his theological course at East Windsor followed immediately.  From the Seminary he went almost at once into mission work at St. Louis. After three years he was ordained there, and in 1843 was installed over the church at Weston, Mo., in the western part of the state, where he remained six years. The next seven years were spent as a missionary pastor in St. Louis. His longest service was that of District Superintendent for Missouri of the American Bible Society, beginning in 1863 and reaching a full twenty-five years, to 1888. In the time of the war and afterward his labors were particularly fruitful, but that his zeal continued strong to the end is shown by the fact that in his last year in office he traveled almost 25,000 miles and delivered 150 addresses for the cause of Bible dissemination. On his eightieth birthday he resigned, and subsequently removed to Nebraska. In 1893 he went to Seattle, Wash., to live with his daughter, Mrs. William T. Whitney. The testimony borne to the beauty of his character as shown in his last days is that " he was a benediction in our midst." Mr. Wright was married in 1842 to Miss A. F. Hurd, of Bridport, Vt. Their golden wedding was duly celebrated in 1892, and Mrs. Wright survives, with the daughter above named. Mr. Wright.<br />

Edmund Wright, son of Ichabod and Mary Clapp Wright, was born in Easthampton, Mass., July 1, 1808; was graduated from Williams College in 1836, and from the Theological Institute of Connecticut in 1839. Strongly possessed of the missionary spirit he entered at  once into mission work at St. Louis, Mo., where after three  years of service he was ordained. In 1843 ne was installed pastor at Weston, Mo., and continued in the work there six years. Returning to St. Louis he spent the next seven years as a missionary pastor in that city. During the Civil War his labors were abundant and fruitful. From 1863 to 1888 he was District Superintendent for Missouri of the American Bible Society, which position he filled with conspicuous energy and ability. From his last report, rendered on his eightieth birthday, when he resigned the position, it appears that during the last year of his work he traveled 24,467 miles, visited and revisited 80 Auxiliaries, attended 37 Anniversaries, visited 20 Ecclesiastical bodies, sent 440 official letters, distributed 5,450 official documents, and delivered 139 addresses and sermons. From Missouri he went to Nebraska, and later (1893) to Seattle, Wash., to live with his daughter, Mrs. William T. Whitney. During the latter years of his life he was identified with the Presbyterian Church and was deeply interested in its work. From his home in Seattle, July 20, 1901, a few days after his ninety-third birthday, he was summoned to the larger service.   He was married August 11, 1842, to Achsah Fidelia Hurd of Bridport, Vt., who with one daughter survives him. Mr. Hurd occupied an honorable place among that noble company of men of whose work President Roosevelt has so recently spoken these golden words: "Without it the conquest of this continent would have had little but an animal side. Without it the pioneer's fierce and rude virtues and somber faults would have been left unlit by the flames of pure and loving aspiration. Without it the life of this country would have been a life of inconceivably hard and barren materialism. Because of it deep beneath and through the national character there runs the power of firm adherence to a lofty ideal upon which the safety of the nation will ultimately depend.  Honor, thrice honor, to those who for three generations, during the period of this people's great expansion, have seen that the force of the living truth expanded as the nation expanded. They bore the burden and heat of the day, they toiled obscurely and died unknown, that we might come into a glorious heritage." One of his family writes of him in these words: " I would like to tell you how much he thought of all his college associations; looking anxiously for the 'Hartford Seminary Record' and reading it as long as he could read at all, these memories were a constant joy to him during his declining years."<br />

From Wikipedia<br />
 <br />
Richard (5 January 1209 - 2 April 1272) was Count of Poitou (bef. 1225), Earl of Cornwall (from 1227) and King of the (German) Holy Roman Empire (formally "King of the Romans") (from 1257).<br />
 <br />
He was the second son of King John "Lackland" and Isabella of Angouleme, and thus, the younger brother of King Henry III; although all other mediaeval lords of Cornwall have been known as "Earl" (or, later, "Duke"), as he is most known to history through continental accounts his version of that title has come down to us in a French-derived rendering ("Count," as opposed to Earl).<br />
 <br />
In 1231 he married Isabel Marshal, the widow of the Earl of Gloucester, much to the displeasure of his brother King Henry, who had been arranging a more advantageous match for Richard. Isabel and Richard had four children, of whom only their son, Henry of Almain, survived to adulthood. When Isabel was on her deathbed in 1240, she asked to be buried next to her first husband at Tewkesbury, but Richard had her interred at Beaulieu Abbey instead. As a pious gesture, however, he sent her heart to Tewkesbury. Later that year Richard joined the Sixth Crusade and departed for the Holy Land.<br />
 <br />
Richard opposed Simon de Montfort, and rose in rebellion in 1238 to protest the marriage of his sister, Eleanor, to Simon de Montfort.<br />
 <br />
In 1257, he was elected by three German Electoral Princes known as the "English party" (Cologne, Mainz and Palatinate) as King of Germany.<br />
 <br />
On April 2, 1272, Richard died at Berkhamstead Castle in Hertfordshire. He was buried at Hayles Abbey, which he had founded.<br />
 <br />
He married three times:<br />
    * On 30 March 1231 to Isabel Marshal, widow of Gilbert de Clare, Earl of Gloucester and Hertford, and daughter of William Marshal, 1st Earl of Pembroke. She died in childbed 17 January 1240.<br />
    * On 23 November 1243 to Sanchia of Provence, daughter of Raymond Berenger IV, count of Provence. She died 9 November 1261.<br />
    * On 16 June 1269 to Beatrice of Falkenburg, daughter of Dietrich I, Count of Falconburg. There were no children. She was aged about sixteen to Richard's sixty, and was said to be one of the most beautiful women of her time. Beatrice died October 17, 1277 and was buried at Friars Minor in Oxford.<br />
 <br />
Issue<br />
Isabel bore him four children, all of whom died in the cradle, except Henry of Almain (1235-1271), Richard's heir apparent. Henry was the victim of the famous murder at Viterbo, when he was cut down while praying in a church by his cousins, Simon the younger de Montfort and Guy de Montfort, Count of Nola. Richard's successor was his son by Sanchia, Edmund, Earl of Cornwall (1249-1300) but he too died childless.<br />
 <br />
Richard had the reputation of being a womanizer, and indeed his only descendants are found among his illegitimate children. His mistress, Joan de Valletort, was certainly the mother of two of his children. Their daughter Joan de Cornwall married Richard Champernowne, and their son Richard de Cornwall died at the Battle of Berwick in 1297. An illegitimate son, Philip de Cornwall, was a cleric in 1248. Another illegitimate son, Walter de Cornwall, was granted lands by his half-brother Edmund, and died in 1313.<br />

Roger Mortimer (25 April 1287 - 29 November 1330), grandson of the 1stBaron Wigmore, was the best-known of his name. As a result of hisadulterous relationship with Isabella of France, queen of King Edward IIof England, he was responsible for deposing (and probably for murdering)King Edward, and himself became effective ruler of England.<br />
 <br />
Early life, family history<br />
Roger was the eldest son and first child born to Edmund Mortimer, 2nd Baron Wigmore, by his wife, Margaret de Fiennes. His father had been a second son, intended for clerical work, but on the sudden death of his elder brother, Edmund was recalled from Oxford University and installed as heir. As a boy, Roger was probably sent to be fostered in the household of his formidable uncle, Roger Mortimer of Chirk. It was this uncle who had carried the head of Llywelyn the Last to King Edward I of England in 1282.<br />
 <br />
Like many noble children of his time, Roger was married young, to Jeanne de Geneville, the heiress of a neighboring lordship. They were married in 1301, and immediately began a family. Through his marriage with Jeanne de Geneville, Roger not only acquired increased possessions on the Welsh marches, including the important Ludlow Castle, which became the chief stronghold of the Mortimers, but also extensive estates and influence in Ireland.<br />
 <br />
Then, suddenly, childhood came to a crashing halt when Edmund Mortimer was mortally wounded in a skirmish near Builth in July 1304. Since Roger was underage at the death of his father, Edmund Mortimer, he was placed by Edward I under the guardianship of Piers Gaveston, and was knighted by Edward in 1306. In that year also Roger was endowed as Baron Wigmore, and came into his full inheritance. His adult life began in earnest.<br />
 <br />
Military adventures in Ireland, Wales<br />
In 1308 he went to Ireland in person, to enforce his authority. This brought him into conflict with the De Lacys, who turned for support to Edward Bruce, brother of Robert Bruce, king of Scotland. Mortimer was appointed lord-lieutenant of Ireland by Edward II. In 1316, at the head of a large army, he drove Bruce to Carrickfergus and the De Lacys into Connaught, wreaking vengeance on their adherents whenever they were to be found.<br />
 <br />
He was then occupied for some years with baronial disputes on the Welsh border until about 1318.<br />
 <br />
Opposition to Edward II<br />
In 1318, Mortimer joined the growing opposition to Edward II and the Despensers, and he supported Humphrey de Bohun, 4th earl of Hereford, in refusing to obey the king's summons to appear before him in 1321.<br />
 <br />
Forced to surrender to the king at Shrewsbury in January 1322, Mortimer was consigned to the Tower of London, but escaped to France in August 1324. In the following year Queen Isabella, wife of Edward II, anxious to escape from her husband, obtained his consent to her going to France to use her influence with her brother, King Charles IV, in favour of peace. At the French court the queen found Roger Mortimer; she became his mistress soon afterwards, and at his instigation refused to return to England so long as the Despensers retained power as the king's favourites.<br />
 <br />
Invasion of England and defeat of Edward II<br />
 <br />
The scandal of Isabella's relations with Mortimer compelled them both to withdraw from the French court to Flanders, where they obtained assistance for an invasion of England. Landing in England in September 1326, they were joined by Henry Plantagenet, 3rd Earl of Leicester; London rose in support of the queen, and Edward took flight to the west, pursued by Mortimer and Isabella.<br />
 <br />
After wandering helplessly for some weeks in Wales, the king was taken prisoner on 16 November, and was compelled to abdicate in favour of his son. Though the latter was crowned as Edward III on January 25, 1327, the country was ruled by Mortimer and Isabella, who are believed to have arranged the murder of Edward II in the following September at Berkeley Castle.<br />
 <br />
Powers won and lost<br />
Rich estates and offices of profit and power were now heaped on Mortimer, and in September 1328 he was created Earl of March. However, he was no more competent than the Despensers to conduct the government of the country. His own son, Geoffrey, mocked him as "the king of folly". The jealousy and anger of Lancaster had been aroused by Mortimer's rise, and Lancaster prevailed upon the young king, Edward III, to assert his independence. At a parliament held at Nottingham in October 1330 a plot was successfully carried out by which Mortimer was arrested in the castle. In spite of Isabella's entreaty to her son to "Fair son, have pity on the gentle Mortimer," was conveyed to the Tower.<br />
 <br />
Accused of assuming royal power and of various other high misdemeanours, he was condemned without trial and hanged at Tyburn on 29 November, 1330, his vast estates being forfeited to the crown. Mortimer's widow, Jeanne, received a pardon in 1336 and survived till 1356. She was buried beside Mortimer at Wigmore, but the site was later destroyed. They had 12 children together:<br />
 <br />
   1. Edmund Mortimer (1302-1331)<br />
   2. Margaret Mortimer (1304-1337), married Thomas de Berkeley, 3rd Lord Berkeley<br />
   3. Roger Mortimer (1305-1338)<br />
   4. Maud Mortimer (1307-aft.1345), married John de Charlton, Lord of Powys<br />
   5. Geoffrey Mortimer (1309-1372/1376)<br />
   6. John Mortimer (1310-1328)<br />
   7. Joan Mortimer (1311/1313-1337/1351), married James Audley, 2nd Baron Audley<br />
   8. Isabella Mortimer (1311/1313-aft.1327)<br />
   9. Catherine Mortimer (1311/1313-1369), married Thomas de Beauchamp, 11th Earl of Warwick<br />
  10. Agnes Mortimer (1315/1321-1368), married Lawrence Hastings, 1st Earl of Pembroke<br />
  11. Beatrice Mortimer (1315/1321-1383), married (1) Edward, 2nd Earl of Norfolk; (2) Thomas de Braose, 1st Baron Brewes<br />
  12. Blanche Mortimer (1314/1322-1347), married Piers de Grandison, 2nd Lord Grandison<br />
 <br />
His eldest son, Edmund, was father of another Roger Mortimer, who was restored to his grandfather's title.<br />

Alan FitzRoland (c.1175-1234) was the last of the MacFergus dynasty ofquasi-independent Lords of Galloway. He was also hereditary Constable ofScotland. He was the son of Roland of Galloway and Helen de Moreville.His date of birth is uncertain, but he was born in or before 1175, as heis considered an adult in 1196.<br />
 <br />
He married firstly to an unnamed daughter of John, Baron of Pontefract and Constable of Chester; they had two daughters, one named Helen (married Roger de Quincy, 2nd Earl of Winchester) and another who died in 1213. His first wife was dead or divorced by 1209, when he married Margaret of Huntingdon, great granddaughter of David 1st of Scotland. By this marriage he had two more daughters: Derbhorgail and Christian (who married William de Forz, Count of Aumale). Alan married his last wife, Rohese de Lacy, in 1229, she being the daughter of Hugh de Lacy, 1st Earl of Ulster. By one of his marriages he had a son, Thomas, who predeceased his father (not to be confused with his illegitimate half-brother, also named Thomas).<br />
 <br />
In 1212 Alan responded to a summons from King John I of England by sending 1,000 troops to join the war against the Welsh. In this year he also sent one of his daughters to England as a hostage. She died in 1213 in the custody of her maternal uncle. Alan is listed as one of the 16 men who counseled King John regarding Magna Carta.<br />
 <br />
Alan, like his forebears, maintained a carefully ambiguous relationship with both the English and Scottish states, acting as a vassal when it suited his purpose and as an independent monarch when he could get away with it. His considerable sea power allowed him to supply fleets and armies to aid the English King John in campaigns both in France and Ireland.<br />
 <br />
In 1228 he invaded the Isle of Man and fought a sea-war against Norway in support of Reginald, Prince of Man, who was engaged in a fratricidal struggle with his brother Olaf for possession of the island.<br />
 <br />
Alan died in 1234 and is buried at Dundrennan Abbey in Galloway. With Alan's death his holdings were divided between his three daughters. A popular attempt was made within Galloway to establish his illegitimate son, Thomas, as ruler, but this failed, and Galloway's period as an independent political entity came to an end.<br />

Hubert de Burgh (c. 1165 - May 12, 1243) was Earl of Kent, Justiciar ofEngland and Ireland, and one of the most influential men in Englandduring the reigns of John and Henry III.<br />
 <br />
De Burgh came from a minor gentry family about which little is known. He was possibly a brother of William de Burgh, Governor of Limerick. He was a minor official in the household of Prince John in 1197, and became John's chamberlain the next year. He continued as John's chamberlain when the latter became king in 1199.<br />
 <br />
In the early years of John's reign de Burgh was greatly enriched by royal favour, receiving the honor of Corfe in 1199 and three important castles in Gwent in 1201 (Grosmont, Skenfrith, and Llantilo). He was also sheriff of Dorset, Somerset, and Herefordshire, and castellan of Laucester and Wallingford castles.<br />
 <br />
The next year de Burgh was appointed Constable of Dover Castle, and also given charge of Falaise, in Normandy. He is cited as having been appointed a Lord Warden of the Cinque Ports by 1215, and although the co-joint position of this office to that of the constableship of Dover Castle was not fully established until after the Baron's War, a rather long period seems to have elasped between the two appointments. (White and Black books of the Cinque Ports Vol XIX 1966)<br />
 <br />
Now comes the part of his early career for which he is best remembered. After John captured his nephew Arthur of Brittany, niece Eleanor and their allies in 1202, de Burgh was made their jailor. There is a story (used, for example, by Shakespeare in his play King John) that the king ordered de Burgh to blind Arthur, but that de Burgh refused. The truth of this has been much doubted, however.<br />
 <br />
In any case de Burgh retained the king's trust, and in 1203 was given charge of the great castle at Chinon, in Touraine, a key to the defence of the Loire valley. There de Burgh held out while the rest of the English possessions fell to the French. Chinon was besieged for a year, and finally fell in June, 1205.<br />
 <br />
During the year he was trapped in Chinon, and the two following years when he was a prisoner of the French, de Burgh lost most of his estates and posts. The reasons are much debated. After his return to England in 1207, he acquired new and different lands and offices. These included the castles of Lafford and Sleaford, and the shrievalty of Lincolnshire. Probably, however, de Burgh spent most of his time in the English holdings in France, where he was seneschal of Poitiers.<br />
 <br />
De Burgh remained loyal to the king during the barons' rebellions at the end of John's reign. The Magna Carta mentions him as one of those who advised the king to sign the charter, and he was one of the 25 guarantors of its execution.<br />
 <br />
De Burgh played a prominent role in the defence of England from the invasion of Louis of France, the son of Philippe II who later became Louis VIII. Louis' first objective was to take Dover Castle, which was in de Burgh's charge. The castle withstood a lengthy siege in the summer and fall of 1216, and Louis withdrew. The next summer Louis could not continue without reinforcements from France. De Burgh gathered a small fleet which defeated a larger French force, and ultimately lead to the complete withdrawal of the French from England.<br />
 <br />
After the death of William Marshal in 1219, de Burgh effectively became regent of England. In this position de Burgh acquired a number of enemies and rivals, who were to dog him for the rest of his life.<br />
 <br />
When Henry III came of age in 1227 de Burgh was made Earl of Kent, and he remained one of the most influential people at court. But in 1232 the plottings of his enemies finally succeeded and he was removed from office and soon was in prison. Two years later, the Archbishop of Canterbury effected a reconciliation.<br />
 <br />
De Burgh married three times: (1) Beatrice de Warrenne; (2) Avisa heiress of Gloucester, ex-wife of King John of England (~1217); (3) Princess Margaret of Scotland, daughter of King William I of Scotland (1221). With his third wife he had a daughter Margaret (~1226-1243), called "Megotta." She married Richard de Clare, Earl of Gloucester. Before the marriages he had a marriage contract with Joan, daughter of William de Reviers, 6th Earl of Devon, but that engagement was broken off in 1200.<br />
 <br />
He had two sons, John and Hubert, by his first wife Beatrice. The former inherited de Burgh's estates but not his earldom or other titles.<br />
 <br />
The relationship between Hubert de Burgh and the later de Burgh's Earl of Ulster and Lord of Connaught is not clear. They descend from William de Burgh (c.1160?-1204) but the relationship between Hubert and William, while generally believed to be true, has never being exactly verified; at most they were brothers, at the very least, cousions.<br />

From Wikipedia<br />
 <br />
Constantine IX Monomachus (c. 1000 - January 11, 1055) reigned as Byzantine emperor from June 11, 1042 to January 11, 1055. He had been chosen by Zo√´ as a husband and co-emperor in 1042, although he had been exiled for conspiring against her previous husband Michael IV. They ruled together until Zo√´ died in 1050.<br />
 <br />
In 1043 he relieved General George Maniaces from his command in Italy, and Maniaces declared himself emperor. His troops were about to defeat Constantine in battle, but he was wounded and died on the field, ending the crisis. Immediately after the victory, Constantine was attacked by a fleet from the Kievan Rus', which had probably been hired by Maniaces. They too were defeated, with the help of Greek fire.<br />
 <br />
In 1046 the Byzantines came into contact for the first time with the Seljuks. They met in battle in Armenia in 1048, and settled a truce the following year. However, Constantine was forced to disband the Armenian troops for financial reasons in 1053, leaving the eastern frontier poorly defended.<br />
 <br />
In 1054 the centuries-old differences between the Greek and Roman churches led to their final separation. Legates from Pope Leo IX excommunicated the Patriarch of Constantinople Michael Cerularius when Cerularius would not agree to adopt western church practises, and in return Cerularius excommunicated the legates. This annulled Constantine's attempts to ally with the Pope against the Normans.<br />
 <br />
Constantine tried to intervene, but he fell ill and died on January 11 of the following year. Theodora, the elderly daughter of Constantine VIII who had ruled with her sister Zo√´, was recalled and named empress.<br />
 <br />
Constantine was also a patron of the scholar Michael Psellus the Younger, whose Chronographica records the history of Constantine's reign.<br />
 <br />
Constantine's nickname, Monomachos (one who fights alone) was inherited by his grandson, Vladimir Monomakh.<br />

Iziaslav Yaroslavich (1024-1078), Prince of Turaw, Grand Prince of Kiev(since 1054), the oldest son of Yaroslav I the Wise. Iziaslav was one ofthe authors of "Pravda Yaroslavichey" - a part of the first Russian legalcode called Russkaya Pravda.<br />
 <br />
In 1043 his father Prince Yaroslav made an agreement with King Casimir I of Poland that recognized Cherven as part of Kiev. The agreement was sealed with a double marriage-Casimir to Dobronega, Yaroslav's sister; and Iziaslav to Gertrude, Casimir's sister. From this marriage was born Iziaslav's son Yaropolk. His other son, Sviatopolk, was illegitimate.<br />
 <br />
As a result of the popular uprising in 1068, Iziaslav was deposed and fled to Poland. In 1069 he retook Kiev with the help the Polish army, however, he was ousted again by his brothers in 1073. Iziaslav turned to German emperor, Polish king and the Pope for help on several occasions. In 1077 he succeeded in retaking Kiev once again, but soon died in an internecine war against princes Oleg Svyatoslavich and Boris Vyacheslavich.<br />

Bj√∂rn J√°rnsÃÅƒ±ƒëa or Bj√∂rn J√§rnsida, Swedish king (ca 785-800) was alegendary viking from the 8th century. He was one of the sons of RagnarLodbrok. He pillaged in Italy and took part in the conquest of Paris withhis father Ragnar Lodbrok.<br />
 <br />
He acquired the name ironside because he was never wounded in battle. This invulnerability was attributed to his mother Aslaug's use of seid in order to make him impervious to iron and steel.<br />
 <br />
According to Hervarar saga he inherited Sweden from his father while his brother Sigurd Snake-Eye inherited the remainder of Scandinavia.<br />
 <br />
The dynasty he founded is called the House of Muns√∂ by modern historians, because a local tradition claims that he is buried in Bj√∂rnsh√∂gen at Husby on the island of Muns√∂. Many of his dynasty were to be named Bj√∂rn.<br />
 <br />
He had two sons, Refil and Erik Bj√∂rnsson, and Erik succeeded him on the throne.<br />

Svyatopolk II Izyaslavich (1050-April 16, 1113) was a supreme ruler ofKievan Rus for 20 years, from 1093 to 1113. He was not a popular princeand his reign was marked by incessant rivalry with his cousin VladimirMonomakh. Upon his death the Kievan citizens raised a rebellion againstthe Jewish merchants and Varangian officials who speculated in grain andsalt.<br />
 <br />
Svyatopolk was the illegitimate1 son of Izyaslav Yaroslavich by his mistress. During his brother Yaropolk's life, Svyatopolk was not regarded as a potential claimant to the Kievan throne. In 1069 he was sent to Polotsk, a city briefly taken by his father from the local ruler Vseslav, and then he spent ten years (1078-88) ruling Novgorod. Upon his brother's death he succeeded him in Turov, which would remain in possession of his descendants until the 17th century.<br />
 <br />
When Vsevolod Yaroslavich died in 1093, Svyatopolk was acknowledged by other princes as a senior Grand Duke's son and permitted to ascend the Kievan throne. Although he participated in the princely congresses organized by Vladimir Monomakh, he is sometimes charged with encouraging internecine wars among Rurikid princes. For instance, he sided with his cousin David of Volynia in capturing and blinding one of Halychian princes. He also sided with Vladimir Monomakh in several campaigns against the Kypchaks but was defeated in the Battle of the Stugna River (1097).<br />

Svyatopolk's Christian name was Michael, so he encouraged embellishment of St Michael's Abbey in Kiev, which has been known as the Golden-Roofed up to the present. The history now known as the Primary Chronicle was compiled by the monk Nestor during Svyatopolk's reign.<br />
 <br />
Svyatopolk married twice; to a Bohemian princess and then in 1094 to a daughter of Tugor Khan of the Kypchaks. By his first wife he had two daughters, Zbyslava, whom he married to king Boleslaw III of Poland, and Predslava to Prince √Ålmos of Croatia. His son Yaroslav reigned in Volynia and was married three times - to Hungarian, Polish, and Kievan princesses. In consequence of Yaroslav's early death, his descendants forfeited any right to the Kievan throne and had to content themselves with Turov and Pinsk.<br />

Erik Refilsson was a Swedish king of the House of Muns√∂. According toHervarar saga, he succeeded his uncle Erik Bj√∂rnsson as the king ofSweden. He was succeeded by his cousins Anund Uppsale and Bj√∂rn at Hauge.<br />
 <br />
According to Hervarar saga, he was a powerful warlord and a rich king: √° t√≥k rÃÅƒ±kit EirÃÅƒ±kr, sonr Refils; hann var mikill hermaƒër ok allrÃÅƒ±kr konungr.<br />
 <br />
Apparently, he was such a successful king that Rimbert relates that at Ansgar's second visit in Birka it was suggested among the people that Erik (Erik who preceded Bj√∂rn) was to be elevated to god instead of the new god.<br />

IRWIN HUBBARD BEADLE, Trust Official.<br />
  Irwin Hubbard Beadle came to Hawaii as a teacher, arriving on the ship "Australia" in 1899 to become an instructor at the Kamehameha School for Boys.

  In 1904 Mr. Beadle was connected with the California Gas & Electric Co. Since that time he has been identified with business enterprises in Honolulu, being one of the incorporators of the Trent Trust Co., Ltd., in 1905. He has been secretary of the firm since its incorporation.<br />
  Mr. Beadle was born in Oswego, N.Y., the son of G. N. and Melissa (Hubbard) Beadle. He is a descendant of G. N. Beadle, who settled in Connecticut before the American Revolution. He married Grace Moore of Hudson Falls, N.Y., in Honolulu, Oct. 25, 1900. They have two children, Irwin and Jack Beadle.<br />
  Mr. Beadle is a member of the Oahu Country, Commercial and Rotary clubs.<br />

TEACHING IN HONOLULU<br />
George N. Beadle, of Scriba, has received an interesting letter from his son, Irwin H. Beadle, teacher in the Kamehameha school at Honolulu, HI. Mr. Beadle graduated from the Oswego Normal school in the class of '97 and went to~ his present position in August last. He speaks well of the school and enjoys the work, but says that they are having a sad time there at present because of a large number of the boys being sick with the measles. Two of the boys died. In speaking of the funeral of one of them the writer says:<br />
"The flag I was at half-mast on the campus and the service was held in our little chapel which, by the way, is as fine a building as there is in Oswego in the shape of a church. The boys all marched down to the steamer, where the body was carried to be shipped home to his parents. The boys were all dressed in their gray uniforms and carried the flag. They presented a fine appearance and I wish those old farmers who talk about cannibals could hare seen them. Everything, in some respects, is as modern as in the States. There are more rubber tired wagons here than in any city I have been in excepting New York.<br />
"I want to tell you about poi and poi making. It is made from the root of the taro plant which grows in the irrigated fields. Taro looks something like turnip. The thick, flashy roots. are cleaned and ground and then made into a thick paste. This has a pleasant, sour taste, which one likes when accustomed to it. I have learned to like it. It is a distinctly native dish and f sis fish or salt pig is usually eaten with it. To eat it, you stick your fork into it and with a quick, deft twist put it into your mouth.<br />
"The poi looks like thick, gray gravy. The natives in the olden times dispensed with forks and simply used the finger, and thumb. When the poi is thin, they use three fingers. Then they call It three finger poi, the other two finger poi. They would sit around a big calabash filled with poi and all eat from the same dish. This habit is supposed to have been one of the means of spreading the leprosy. Poi is very healthy and that is the reason the natives are so fat.<br />
"Some people have an idea that there are lepers on the inland, which is not true. There are no lepers on any of the islands except Molokai. "Here everyone rides horseback, although it is not necessary, for we have better roads than you find any where in the northern part of New York State. One sees as great a proportion of bicycles here as on Long Island.<br />
"Honolulu has a population of nearly 50,000. It is a very beautiful place and lies at the foot of two lofty volcanoes, which are now extinct, called Diamond Head and Punch. Bowl.<br />
"The chief crops here are taro and rice, which is raised in the low lands, and bananas and pineapples, which grow on the higher lands. Along the beach are thousands of coconut trees. Oranges, dates, guava, tamarind, mangoes, grapes, bread fruit and every other sort of tropical fruit is seen in abundance,<br />
"There is no weather here that even approaches to winter, but there is a wet and dry season. Some days it rains three or four times and some it doesn't rain at all.<br />
"Since I have been herd the thermometer has not registered below 69¬∞, nor above 76¬∞, most of the time it does vary two degrees from 76¬∞."<br />
In speaking of his assent of a mountain with a friend Mr. Beadle says:<br />
"We went on horseback and when we arrived at the highest point to which we could urge the animals we picketed them and began the remainder of the ascent on foot. After climbing for an hour we reached a point where the rocks began to ascend almost vertically. By hard climbing we at last reached the highest point. It was a very sharp, ragged peak; the top of it was not over two rods in diameter. On the windward side it descended in sheer precipice of several thousand feet and on the leeward tile, toward Honolulu, it sloped away at a very sharp angle. This precipice is called Kalihi Pai. Several miles away we could see Honolulu, and away in the other direction we saw the mountains, while the sea could be seen beyond. On the way back ire stopped at the hut of an old Chinaman, and he gave us a big bowl of Poi, and at another Chinese farmer's we got a papaito to eat. If you could see the Chinamen hero you would have more respect for them than yon do now."<br />
Mr. Beadle closes with messages to his relatives and another expression of his liking for the school and its work.<br />

William de Burgh (c. 1160 - 1204) was born in the village of BurghCastle, Norfolk, East Anglia, Kingdom of England and died at AthassellAbbey, Golden, County Tipperary, Munster, Ireland.<br />
 <br />
William took his surname from the village of Burgh Castle, Norfolk, England. Very little can be ascertained about his background other than his family were minor gentry, and that his probable younger brother was Hubert de Burgh, later Earl of Kent.<br />
 <br />
William apparently arrived in Ireland in 1184 among the retinue of Prince John of England, son of Henry II of England and Eleanor of Aquitaine.<br />
 <br />
John apparently appointed him Governor of Limerick. Within a few years he was granted the manors of Kilsheeland and Ardpatrick, and in time, the castle of Tibraghty in County Kilkenny.<br />
 <br />
Sometime in the 1190s, William married a daughter of Donal Mor mac Turlough O'Brian, King of Thomond (died 1194). This alliance probably took place during the reign of his son, Murtough, as up to the time of his death Donal had being at war with the Normans. At any rate no more wars are recorded between the two sides for the rest of the decade.<br />
 <br />
Alliance with Connacht<br />
In 1200, "Cathal Crobderg Ua Conchobair went into Munster, to the son of Mac Carthy and William Burke to solicit their aid." This marked the start of de Burgh's interest in the province. Though King of Connacht Cathal Crobderg Ua Conchobair (reigned 1190 - 1224) faced much opposition, mainly from within his own family and wished to engage Burke's aid to help secure his position. The following year William and Ua Conchobair led an army from Limerick to Tuam and finally to Boyle. Ua Conchobair's rival, Cathal Carragh Ua Conchobair marched at the head of his army to give them battle but was killed in a combined Burke/Ua Conchobair onslaught after a week of skirmishing between the two sides.<br />
 <br />
William and Ua Conchobair then travelled to Iar Connacht and stayed at Cong for Easter. Here, William and the sons of Rory O'Flaherty conspired to kill Ua Conchobair but the plot was foiled, apparently by holy oaths they were made to swear by the local Coarb family. However, when de Burgh demanded payment for himself and his retinue, battle finally broke out with over seven hundred of de Burgh's followers said to have being killed. William, however, managed to return to Limerick.<br />
 <br />
Death<br />
The Annals of the Four Masters recorded his passing in 1204:<br />
"William Burke plundered Connaught, as well churches as territories; but God and the saints took vengeance on him for that; for he died of a singular disease, too shameful to be described."<br />
