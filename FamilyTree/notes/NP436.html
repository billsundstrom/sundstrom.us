Mark Daniel POVOLNY
<p>
<a name ="I026747"><b>[I026747]</b></a><br />
After two year break, Povolny returns to Eau Claire<br>
By Erica Dakins Thursday, Dec. 11, 2003<br>
Imagine warm, sunny days spent at the beach, surfing the cerulean blue waves, seeing the tan, blond-haired natives in a diverse culture highlighted by Hollywood and the Golden Gate Bridge.<br>
After experiencing life in California, Mark Povolny chose to leave the warmth behind and return to Eau Claireʼs cold, snowy winters.<br>
From the time Povolny graduated high school in 2000 from Immanuel Lutheran High School, College and Seminary (ILC) in Eau Claire, until he returned in the fall of 2002 as a freshman at the University of Wisconsin-Eau Claire, Povolny had gained life experience and decided what he wanted to do with his life.<br>
After Povolny graduated, he decided to not go straight to college for two reasons, he said.<br>
His first reason, according to him, was because he just did not know where he wanted to go or what he wanted to do.<br>
Povolnyʼs father graduated from seminary at ILC the same time as Povolny graduated high school, so the family would be moving to a new church in a new area, though they did not know where it would be, Povolny said. This provided his second reason, picking out a college was extremely difficult, since he had no idea which part of the country he would call home.<br>
In the April of 2000, the Povolny family found that they would be moving to Mountain View, California and Povolny decided he would go with. While there, he said he gained valuable work experience at Electronic Arts, listed as one of the best 100 companies to work for, according to Fortune Magazine.<br>
After a year of working in California, Povolny decided it was time to continue his education. In order attend the university he chose, UW-Eau Claire, he needed to gain back a resident status. He and his brother Steve Povolny, who also moved back to Eau Claire for college, both worked and lived in Eau Claire for the 12 months required by the UW System for their resident status.<br>
Povolnyʼs mother, Susi Povolny, misses her sons, but she understands why they went back to Wisconsin.<br>
"They had grown up in Wisconsin, and spent their high school years in Eau Claire," She said. "Their church fellowship, and especially with the other kids from high school, was really important to them."<br>
Povolnyʼs approach to college was not the traditional route that most students take, yet this does not make him a non-traditional student, according to UW-Eau Claire requirements.<br>
Students considered to be non-traditional meet one of three requirements, said Bonnie Isaacson, the Adult Student Advisor in the Adult Opportunity Center. They must be married, a parent or over the age of 24, to be considered non-traditional.<br>
After Povolny marries his fiancée, Erin Nolting in May 2005, he will become a non-traditional student. Povolny met Nolting in California while she was on her senior class trip from Immanuel Lutheran High School in Mankato, Minn. The students stayed with families in the area, and Nolting said she met Povolny at church, the day after she arrived. Povolny accompanied her class on a few of the trips, and they stayed in touch after she went back to Minnesota. They started dating at the end of that summer, after both had moved to Eau Claire, and got engaged two years later.<br>
Povolny hopes that when he graduates in 2006 he will be on his way to a career in broadcast journalism. Becoming a national evening news anchor is his dream job, he said.<br>
"I like following the news," Povolny said. "I enjoy staying connected. Being a news anchor plays into my strengths. Iʼm a good speaker and a good writer."<br>

James"Jim" B. Powell, 63, of Ontario, WI, passed away Saturday, September 8, 2012, at the Vernon Memorial Healthcare Center in Viroqua.<br>
Jim was born in Sparta, WI, May 2, 1949, to Roland and Harriet (Stedman) Powell. Jim grew up and attended school in Ontario and graduated in 1967. After graduation he hauled milk for Edwin Bredlow then, worked in masonry for Boldon Brothers construction. When his father became ill, Jim took over the family farm. He loved working the farm while teaching his boys all the knowledge he had of farming.<br>
On October 6, 1984, he was united in holy matrimony to Nancy Ferries. Together they took over Ferries Oil when Nancy's father passed away. Along with the oil deliveries he handed out tootsie-rolls and bubble gum for 18 years to many Monroe and Vernon County families. After his retirement from the oil business, Jim was a bus driver for the Norwalk-Ontario-Wilton School District. This was a job that he really liked, but most importantly, the children loved him.<br>
Jim always found time for his boys. Their favorite times together were spent hunting or fishing and cutting wood. Jim had just returned from a great fishing trip with his sons and grandson in Homer, Alaska. These special memories will never be forgotten. Jim was a genuinely good guy with a wonderful sense of humor, warm smile, and true love for people. He was never too busy to stop and talk or offer a helping hand. He will be missed by many.<br>
Jim is survived by his wife, Nancy of Ontario; two sons, Jason (Shasta) and their children, Jonathon, Hannah and Gabrielle of Holmen, WI; and Matt (fiancé, Nicolle), and their children, Caitlin and Breanna Powell and Austin, Bailey and Seth Granger of Mauston, WI; siblings, Anita Gibson of Ontario, and David (Lisa) Powell of Wilton; mother-in-law, Fern Ferries of Ontario; Sisters-in-law, Juanita Vitcenda of Janesville, Bette Ferries of Ontario, Lori Laufenburger of Winona, and Cindy Ferries of Ontario; along with many nieces, nephews, other relatives and dear friends.<br>

Joseph Howard POWELL
<p>
<a name ="I077726"><b>[I077726]</b></a><br />
When Joseph Powell spoke, people listened, his son Kirk Powell recalls. <br>
"My dad was never one to yell and scream and throw things," the younger Powell recalled Wednesday, the day after his father's death at age 85. "He never got mad ... but if he spoke, when he spoke, they listened to what he said: It was like a big stick." <br>
The elder Powell , a retired biology professor at Sonoma State University, used his encyclopedic knowledge of the Gospels to guide his friends and family through hard times. <br>
"Depending on the situation, he could go to Scripture and point you in the direction you needed to go in whatever crisis you were in," he said. "He knew the Scriptures up and down and east and west." <br>
Powell spent about three decades at Sonoma State, teaching a variety of classes from basic biology to specialized classes on mushrooms, said long-time colleague Phil Northen. <br>
He maintained an extensive collection of mushroom samples and developed an in-depth knowledge of the algaes native to the North Coast. <br>
"He was a very, very friendly guy; he related on a personal level to his students," Northen said. "He was a really good guy." <br>
Powell started life as an electrician, said his wife of nearly 60 years, Eloise Powell . <br>
After a period in the Army, serving in Korea after the war there ended, Powell decided to go to college. He studied science, a lifelong interest, and took a job as a middle-school teacher. <br>
He eventually pursued his graduate degree from the University of Washington and began his career in higher education. <br>
He taught for several years in the mid-1960s at the American University in Beirut, Lebanon, until the political situation in the Middle East became too unstable. <br>
The family, including their four adoptive children, chose to move to Sonoma County in 1968, passing up teaching positions in Florida and Southern California. <br>
The move was in part because Sonoma State University was near the ocean, where he could pursue his research, and in part because his wife had disliked the humidity of Lebanon, making the other options unattractive for the family. <br>
Although he devoted his career to academia, Powell remained interested in his roots as a craftsman, his son said. He filled his homes with hand-crafted wooden shelves and cabinetry. <br>
"He did a lot of really neat finishes on redwood boards he would clean up," his son said. <br>
Northen said Powell used his handy skills to good advantage in the Sonoma State labs, where he could build or repair just about anything. <br>
Faith was a central part of Powell 's life, family members say, and he was active in the Santa Rosa Nazarene Church. <br>
Powell was raised in Idaho by a religious mother but a more secular father. It was not until he and his future wife met that he made a deep commitment to Christ, following the Bible passage that had inspired his mother: Matthew 7:13, which calls on Christians to follow the "narrow path" that leads to heaven. <br>
"He followed that narrow path that leads to life everlasting," his wife said, "and I will see him again." <br>
He combined his faith with his biology background in a 1996 book, "Grapes of Righteousness: Spiritual Grafting into the True Vine," comparing a person's spiritual growth with the careful tending and development of a vineyard by a grape grower. <br>
In addition to his wife, Powell is survived by his four children, Jonathan Powell of San Diego; Susan Cummerford of Santa Rosa; Scott Powell of Vallejo; and Kirk Powell of Santa Rosa. He had six grandchildren and four great-grandchildren. <br>
Kirk Powell said his father enjoyed time with his grandkids, and he took them on camping trips in the 1990s after he retired. <br>
Powell suffered from heart problems for more than a decade, his family said. He died of congestive heart failure. <br>
A memorial service will be held at 1 p.m. Saturday at Santa Rosa Nazarene Church, 1135 Farmers Lane in Santa Rosa. <br>
