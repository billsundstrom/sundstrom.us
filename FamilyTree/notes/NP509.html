McHenry Tries To Stop A Parole<br>
McHenry County officials have argued against parole for a man sentenced to two consecutive 150 to 200-year prison sentences for killing two county residents in 1970.<br>
The Illinois Prisoner Review Board has already denied parole seven times for Phillip Lee Soper, 43, who is also serving a concurrent life term for the killing of a Wisconsin nursing home resident.<br>
Soper also has admitted to the murder of a nursing home resident in Ohio but has never been convicted in that case, officials said.<br>
How much more dangerous must a man be before we recognize that prison is the only safe place to keep him from hurting us again, McHenry County First Assistant State's Atty. Michael Vujovich said in a statement.<br>
Soper was convicted in 1971 of the shooting murders of Marlene Ahrens of Woodstock and Guenther Dolenske of McHenry. Soper is serving his sentence at the Menard Correctional Center in Chester, Ill., Vujovich said.<br>
Ahrens was fatally shot Dec. 17, 1970, when Soper surprised her in the back of the dentist's office where she was working as a receptionist. He had intended to rob an adjacent tavern but mistakenly entered the office.<br>
At the same time, Soper shot John Bocker, the owner of the building where the office was located. Bocker survived.<br>
The next day Soper shot Dolenske five times while robbing the Farmhouse Tavern in McHenry. After Soper robbed the bar and its patrons, Dolenske followed him outside to write down the car`s license plate number.<br>
Soper reportedly warned him to stop, but Dolenske refused and he was shot. A short time later Soper was arrested at a McHenry hotel where he had been living for about two months.<br>
Because of scheduling conflicts, Vujovich can not attend Soper's hearing Wednesday, so he appeared before the Prisoner Review Board last week to argue that Soper should never be released.<br>
Soper has been eligible for parole since 1980. He has applied for parole seven times and been denied each time. At his last appearance, in 1988, the board agreed to hear his request every three years.<br>
