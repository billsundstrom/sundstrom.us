Ronald Clayton "Ron" Johnson   ( Saturday, 31 Jul 2010 )<br>
Ron, in his 61st year, passed away peacefully in his home in Vernon, B.C. Born in Golden, BC, on Dec.10 1949, Ron was the oldest son of Clayton and Edith Johnson (McCaull), of Parson, BC. Ron lived in Parson most of his young life except for the times he spent in the Children?s Hospitals in Calgary AB and Vancouver BC; having had problems with his feet when he was born. He rode the bus to High School in Golden. Ron liked to ride snow machines & motorcycles and to fix old cars. He also liked to paddle small boats in the sloughs and the river near his home in Parson. Ron always had a big smile on his face for all the years we knew him. We will always remember him driving around in one of his many big old cars. After being employed at Evans Forest Products (now L.P.), Ron moved around quite a bit. He drove grader in Cranbrook, worked paving in Kamloops & Revelstoke, and drove truck to Yellowknife and Alaska. He was a companion to Kurt Hahn, and traveled with him and his paintings. He spent time in Dawson Creek laying pipes, and in Salmon Arm picking fruit before he found his way to Vernon where he worked for Ace Contracting driving truck, and doing mechanic work on various machines. Ron was predeceased by his brother Ralph in 1970, and his cousin David Johnson in 1975, plus many uncles and aunts. Ron is survived by his parents, Clayton and Edie; his sister Jeni (Gary) Brock and family; his brother Jerry (Nancy), and family and his brother Lyle and family. Ron also leaves behind numerous aunts, uncles, cousins, nieces and nephews and extended family members. Ron?s family would like to send a huge thank you for the flowers, cards, phone calls and all expressions of condolence; and also to the staff at the Vernon Hospital for Ron?s care prior to his death. We are especially thankful to his brother Lyle for taking on the responsibilities of the details of Ron?s death, as well as those friends who helped Lyle make some weighty decisions in Vernon. To all Ron?s friends in Vernon: Thank you for your kindnesses. To him you are the greatest. We will all miss him dearly. Upon Ron?s request there will be no funeral service or tea.<br>
