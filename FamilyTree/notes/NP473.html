She was born November 29, 1953, in Milwaukee, the daughter of Richard and Marion (Leonard) Saulig. Sue graduated from Wauwatosa East High School in 1972. On December 16, 1972, she married Steven Clark Sherman at Wauwatosa Presbyterian Church.<br>
Following her marriage, Sue was a homemaker while Steve was in the Air Force. She later went to work as a teller for Security Savings and Loan where she worked her way to Regional Manager for Security Savings Bank. She always wanted to come back to Door County, where she and Steve met, and in 1996, they bought the Village Green Lodge in Ephraim. They eventually built their home on the property in 2008.<br>
Sue was an active member of the Ephraim Moravian Church where she served as church trustee. She served her community on the Ephraim Village Board and on the Ephraim Business Council. She was honored to be voted 51st Fyr Bal Chieftain in 2015 by her community peers. Sue was also on the board of directors for the Door County Visitor Bureau.<br>
Those left behind to mourn her passing include her loving husband, Steve Sherman of Ephraim; her mother, Marion Saulig of Sister Bay; two sons, Jason (Misty) Sherman of Caledonia, Ryan (Angela) Sherman of Fish Creek; two grandsons, Mylo and Theo Sherman; four siblings, Kathy (John) Eldridge of Colgate, Kim (Dan Friend) Saulig of Hayward, Thomas (Cathy) Saulig of Algoma, Debra (Dave) Koch of Cedar Grove; in-laws, Scott (Heidi) Sherman of Vero Beach, FL, Barb (Charles Shelton) Schwartz of Cincinnati, OH, Marietta Sherman of Sturgeon Bay; and many nieces and nephews.<br>

Sue was devoted to her family, especially being a grandma. She was an amazing cook, having perfected her own recipes as well as those of her mother and grandmother's; she was featured on the television show Living With Amy many times making her signature dishes. Sue took pride in making the gardens of her home and the Village Green Lodge stunning and cut many of her favorite hydrangeas to brighten someone's day, or even wedding. Sue was the first one to step up if she saw someone in need, even when she was sick she continued to organize and take care of details for family, business, and friends. Sue was sweetness, selfless-to a fault, inspiring, faithful, and big hearted.<br>
A celebration of her life will be held at 11:00 a.m. on Monday, August 10, 2015, at the Ephraim Moravian Church with Rev. Dawn Volpe officiating.<br>
