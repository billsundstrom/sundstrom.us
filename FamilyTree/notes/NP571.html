<h2>Notes</h2>
Richard WARREN
<p>
<a name ="I006103"><b>[I006103]</b></a><br />
Richard Warren appears to have been a merchant, who resided in London, and became associated with the Pilgrims and the Mayflower through the Merchant Adventurers. Richard Warren participated in several of the early explorations made by the Pilgrims in 1620, while looking for a place to settle. He appears by land records to have been fairly well-to-do.<br>
<br>
When he came over on the Mayflower, he left behind his wife and five daughters, planning to have them sent over after things were more settled in the Colony. His wife and daughters arrived in America in 1623, on the ship Anne.<br>
<br>
Nathaniel Morton wrote in his book New England's Memorial, first published in 1669, the following about Richard Warren:<br>
<br>
This year [1628] died Mr. Richard Warren, who was a useful instrument and during his life bare a deep share in the difficulties and troubles of the first settlement of the Plantation of New Plymouth.<br>
<br>
Richard Warren is an ancestor to many famous Americans. Among them are Presidents Ulysses S. Grant and Franklin D. Roosevelt; and Alan B. Shepard, Jr., the first American in space and fifth man to walk on the moon.<br>

Information from Seymour Paul (originally from Don Abbott, Southern California Genealogical Society):<br>
Richard Warren of London, England; merchant, "a useful instrument."<br>
Member of exploration parties along Cape Cod; Probably Assistant Governor 1624-8. The 12th signer of the Mayflower Compact. Married Elizabeth Jouett Marsh in 1605 in London, England. Born 1580 to Christopher Warren and Alice Webb. Elizabeth Jouett Marsh was born 1583 and died 1673.<br>
An article, "Richard Warren and his Descendants" appearing in MD 3:45-51 covers all known records of him and his wife Elizabeth. Also a booklet published by the Mayflower Society covers him and his descendants to 4 generations. Little is known about Richard Warren, owing most probably to his death so shortly after settling in Plymouth. His wife Elizabeth was quite prominent in the colony afterwards. The only provably known source for his place of origin (according to [MD 3:45-6]) is from Mourt's Relations, where a short quote on p.15 says he was "a Londoner".<br>
___________________________<br>
<br>
Richard Warren's parents have not been identified. Therefore, he does not have any known or proven royal ancestry as often claimed. A report on some of the searches for Richard Warren's parents can be found in MQ 51:109+. His wife Elizabeth's maiden name is unknown--it is not Marsh, Evans, or Jewett, three commonly thrown around myths. Richard's wife Elizabeth came to America on the Anne, 1623, bringing their five daughters.<br>

RICHARD WARREN AND HIS DESCENDANTS.<br>
Compiled from Original Sources, by GEORGE ERNEST BOWMAN.<br>
<br>
Richard Warren was from London and joined the Leyden Pilgrims in July 1620 at Southampton, whence the Mayflower and the Speedwell first set sail for America. He was married in England, before 1611, to Elizabeth-, whose maiden name is unknown, and had by her five daughters, Mary, Anna (born about 1612), Sarah, Elizabeth and Abigail, who were left in England and came to Plymouth with their mother in 1623. Nothing more is known of his life before he joined the Pilgrims on the Mayflower, and there are very few references to him in the Plymouth Colony records and the works of contemporary writers, doubtless owing to his early death in 1628.Bradford's History mentions him only in the list of the Mayflower passengers,* and includes him among the few who were of enough importance to be distinguished by the title of "Mr." Nathaniel Morton, in the New England's Memorial, published at Cambridge, Mass., in 1669, was the first to print the names of the forty-one men who signed the Compact in the cabin of the Mayflower on Saturday, 11/21 November, 1620, and Richard Warren's name appears in this list. The following extract from Mourt's Relation contains the only reference yet found to the place from which Richard Warren came. It also shows us that he was a member of the third exploring party sent out while the Mayflower lay at anchor in Cape Cod Harbor. This party set out in the shallop on Wednesday, 6/16 December, 1620, and after many hardships, including a fight with the Indians early Friday morning, landed at Plymouth on the following Monday, 11/21 December, 1620.Wednesday the sixt of December, it was resolved our discoverers should set forth, for the day before was too fowle weather, and so they did, though* Mayflower Descendant, 1: 10, 24.

A Personal Tribute to Shields Warren, M.D. (1898-1980)<br>
Dr. Shields Warren, pioneer pathologist and expert in medical radiation, died in July at his summer home in Mashpee, Massachusetts. Dr. Warren's restless intellectual curiosity brought him international recognition for his contributions to the pathology of endocrine diseases, as well as for his study of the biologic effects of ionizing radiation.<br>
Long concerned about the medical benefits and hazards of radiation, Dr. Warren made the first systematic examination of radioactive fallout, and as a Navy officer aided and studied the surviving victims of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Convinced that atomic energy could be made to serve rather than destroy humanity, he worked to identify and control the dangers of radiation. As a pathologist, he searched for ways to apply the products of atomic energy to diagnosis and therapy, most notably by his use of radioisotopes, which virtually revolutionized earlier techniques. <br>
His scientific achievements brought him numerous prestigious awards, including the American Cancer Society National Award for 1968, the Enrico Fermi Award, and the Albert Einstein Medal and Award. His forward leadership extended to many years of distinguished government service with the Atomic Energy Commission, Department of Defense, National Academy of Sciences, National Aeronautics and Space Administration, and Veterans' Administration.<br>
Born in 1898 in Cambridge, Massachusetts, Dr. Warren was graduated from Boston University, where his grandfather had been the first president and his father had been dean of the college of liberal arts. After graduation from Harvard Medical School, Dr. Warren worked in diabetes research, writing the first of his nine textbooks, before turning his attention to cancer research.<br>

Harvey Alexander WATERMAN
<p>
<a name ="I026400"><b>[I026400]</b></a><br />
When Harvey was 14 he left home. He was apprenticed to a blacksmith-wheelwright. He got his room and board and three dollars a month. There was no particular pay day. He asked for money when he wanted or needed it and usually received 50 cents at a time. When he completed his apprenticeship he did not go back home to live. He went over to Maine to work in the lumber woods as a blacksmith shoeing the horses, sharpening axes and saws, replacing sled runners, and making general repairs. He was in the vicinity of Mount Katahdin. The custom was to go into the woods in the fall, live in the bunkhouses in a lumber camp, and come out in the spring. Harvey said that the first stop when you hit town was to buy new clothes, go to a turkish bath and leave your old clothes to be burned. He was prone to exaggerate a bit, but he said he never took his clothes off all winter. He came to Sterling, Massachusetts because his father spent a summer working there on the Butterick farm (this farm belonged to the man who invented the paper dress pattern). He met his wife in Sterling. Back then in 1899, when a young man took a lady "out" he had to take a chaperone along. On their first day, he took her plus the chaperone to Fitchburg to see the play "The Old Homestead" by Danham Thompson (from Swanzey, NH). When he first came to Sterling he worked for Lemuel Millet in a blacksmith shop. <br>

Worcester Telegram & Gazette, 18 January 1997<br>
------------------------------------<br>
Vernon was born in Greendale (a part of Worcester) where my father worked for Young Brother's Ladder Co. When he was a baby he was allergic to milk, and was therefore sickly, skinny and fretful. Gram Boynton said that when she came to help my mother, she would say to her, "You hold the baby and I'll do the housework." She was afraid he might die in her arms.<br>
My father said that when he was attempting to teach Vern the alphabet the child would not say the letter "a." Dad would say, "Say "a" Vernon." Vern would say "b, c, d." Dad would then say, "Say "a" Vernon." Then Vern would burst into tears and say, "I can't say "a"."<br>
Around this time it is said that Vern sawed his rocking horse (two horses with a seat between them) in half because he wanted to ride bare-back.<br>
He was ill so much that my mother held him a great deal. When baby Wenona would cry, he would slide down her lap and say, "Feed her." (All of us were breast-fed.) Then he would go and stand in the corner and cry, saying, "I cry all the time, all the time, all the time."<br>
