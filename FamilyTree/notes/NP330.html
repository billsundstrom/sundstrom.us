Breauna M. Logan wrote the following a few months before she committed suicide at the age of 13:<br>
Love<br>
Love is the element that everyone has inside of them. Some express it greatly while others keep it bottled up deep inside. No matter if they express it or not it's still there. Sometimes love hurts deeply and other times it fills us with joy. We need love to live, without it we are dead inside. <br>
We all love someone whether a family member, friend, or someone special. So in fact we are all loved, it might not be the person you love, but someone none the less. If you love someone that loves you back then you should cherish it and try not to lose it. Losing love is always hard whether you fall out of love or someone falls out of love with you, but always know you can find someone else to love you back. You can not force someone to love you so don't pretend to be someone that your not because then that person will love who your pretending to be not who you are inside. <br>
If your not in love with someone don't say you are because in the end you'll hurt not only that person but also yourself. But life goes on so you can find your true love, someone that you want to spend the rest of your life with. Love can be cruel but it can also be the best thing in life when your with the one.<br>
Don't abuse love and take it for granted or it will end. So if you love someone tell them so they know how you really feel, and who knows they could love you back.<br>
