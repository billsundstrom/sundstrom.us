</p>
Richard Seifert GASPAROTTI
<p>
<a name ="I047481"><b>[I047481]</b></a><br />
Richard was first married 30 November 1943 to Pearl Jansky at Royal Oak, MI.Richard S. Gasparotti, 96 passed away on October 9, 2018. <br>
Richard (Dick) was born on March 12, 1922 in Collinsville, Illinois to John J. and Elizabeth (Seifert) Gasparotti. His wife Beverly Ann (Swanson), older brother John Joseph III (Jack) and a younger brother Paul Anthony preceded him in death. The brothers are survived by their youngest sibling, Anna Catharine (Felter). <br>
As a child, Richard and his family moved to Moberly, a railroad town in north central Missouri. Dick and his brothers loved the big steam locomotives and that may have been where Dick's fascination with all things mechanical began. Richard studied art at the University of Iowa as an ROTC student. In the spring of 1942, Dick used his ROTC status and joined the Army, reporting for training at Fort Benning in Columbus, GA. His answers on early tests confirmed his mechanical aptitude. Dick was assigned to the Army Air Corps and sent to technical and Flight Engineer training for B-24 Liberators at Chanute Field in Illinois. He was then stationed at Boise's Gowen Field for the duration of the war where he worked as a trainer for war bound B-24 bomber flight engineers. After the war he worked for Empire Airlines then returned to Missouri and became a member of the Missouri Air National Guard. He missed the weather and geography of Idaho and moved back to Boise and transferred to the Idaho Air National Guard as a full-time airman maintaining aircraft. The Air National Guard sent Dick to Alaska during the Korean conflict where he was flight engineer on B-29s towing practice targets for anti-aircraft ground crews. He retired from the Air National Guard in 1967 and began work as an aircraft A & P mechanic in the private sector. After restoring a WWI bomber, a 1917 Avro for Joe Terteling, Dick enjoyed a long career working on the aircraft of the Simplot "air force." When he retired from Simplot in 1989 he was working in the same Gowen Field hangar where he started his aircraft maintenance career in 1942. <br>
Richard had a passion for antique cars and was an early member of the Southwest Idaho Regional Group of the Horseless Carriage Club of America. On the HCC Labor Day tour to McCall, Idaho in 1954, Richard married Beverly Swanson at the Shore Lodge.<br>
After their marriage Richard and Beverly were members of Immanuel Lutheran Church where Dick who was an Eagle scout was the Scoutmaster for Troop 81 for over five years. Later, the family joined Redeemer Lutheran Church in Boise.<br>
He restored and assisted others in restoring many "pre-1915" cars and was often seen driving his 1911 E-M-F around southern Idaho. Richard also owned and restored Locomobile steam cars; his 1900 Locomobile is believed to be the oldest registered automobile in Idaho. Dick's love for antique cars "infected" his kids who still collect, restore, maintain, and drive their charming brass, nickel and classic cars.<br>
Dick and Beverly had three children, Richard of Los Angeles, Roy of Emmett, and Ann (Atkinson) of Miles City. The couple had five grandchildren and there are currently four great-grandchildren.<br>
Richard moved to Emmett, Idaho from Boise in 2007.<br>
Richard was a member of Our Redeemer Lutheran Church in Emmett, Idaho where his funeral service will be held on October 27, 2018 at 11:00 am<br>

Posted on Find-a-Grave:<br>
The June, 1880 Federal census shows Jesse as a harness maker and boarder living in the town of Madison, South Dakota. Jesse then came to Miner County, South Dakota as one of the early settlers in 1881 and made a homestead claim (southeast edge of town of Vilas, Section 8, Township 106 North, Range 56 West, patent dated April 10, 1884). In 1882 he opened a harness and repair shop on the east side of Main Street in Howard, South Dakota and operated it until 1929. His original store burned in the "Big Fire" of 1892. Jesse rebuilt a two storefront block at same location. In 1930 he and Josie opened a variety (department) store in Howard which was also run by their daughter Jessie. Jesse also operated a farm about 11 miles north of Howard. Jesse was a long-time Howard city offical and served as Mayor for several years in the early 1900s and later city auditor.<br>
Jesse married Rena G. Langland about 1882 and they had two children, Grant (b. January 1884, d. 1941, married Florena ?) and Maude (b. October 1885, married Frank Zickrick July 16, 1907). Rena died in August 1900 and Jesse and Grant are both buried next to Rena in Graceland cemetery south of Howard.<br>
Family moved into Joseph & Barbara Formanack house in Howard, South Dakota ( Lot 3, Block 1, Farmer's Addition) in October 1917 (purchased from Joseph & Barbara September 23, 1918).<br>
Jesse was one of the "troops" (50-60 Howard men) who in 1882 attempted to remove the Miner County records from Forestburg to Howard in the struggle between the two towns over which would be the site of the county courthouse. At the James River crossing on the night of the"raid", Jesse was one of the men detailed to hold the horses and wagons at the river.<br>
Jesse was an early member of the Masonic lodge in Howard and later of the IOOF.<br>

John of GAUNT
<p>
<a name ="I008254"><b>[I008254]</b></a><br />
John of Gaunt, 1st Duke of Lancaster (June 24, 1340 - February 3, 1399), the third surviving son of King Edward III of England, he gained his name because he was born at Ghent in 1340. He became Duke of Lancaster by his first marriage to his cousin, Blanche (1359), heiress to the Palatinate of Lancaster, a title which gave its holder considerable independence from the crown. John became a fabulously wealthy prince with thirty castles and vast estates across England and France. His household was comparable in scale and organization to that of a monarch.<br>
<br>
After the death of his elder brother, Edward, the Black Prince, John of Gaunt became increasingly powerful. He contrived to protect the religious reformer, John Wyclif, with whose aims he sympathized. However, Gaunt's ascendancy to political power coincided with widespread resentment at his influence. At a time when English forces encountered setbacks in the Hundred Years' War against France and Edward III's rule had started to become domestically unpopular due to high taxation and to the King's affair with Alice Perrers, political opinion closely associated the Duke of Lancaster with the failing government of the 1370s. Furthermore, while the king and the Prince of Wales had the status of popular heroes due to their success on the battlefield, Gaunt had never known any such military success which might have bolstered his reputation.<br>
<br>
When King Edward III died (1377) and John's nephew, the ten-year-old Richard II of England, succeeded to the throne, Gaunt's influence strengthened further, but mistrust remained and some suspected him of wanting to seize the throne for himself. He took pains to ensure that he never became associated with the opposition to Richard's kingship, but as virtual ruler of England during Richard's minority, some unwise decisions on taxation led to the Peasants' Revolt in 1381, during which the rebels destroyed his Savoy Palace.<br>
<br>
In 1386, Richard, who had by now assumed more power for himself, dispatched Gaunt to Spain as an ambassador. However, crisis ensued almost immediately and in 1387 Richard's misrule took the country to the brink of civil war. Only John of Gaunt, on his return to England, was able to bring about a compromise between the Lords Appellant and King Richard, ushering in a period of stability and relative harmony. During the 1390s, John of Gaunt's reputation of devotion to the well-being of the kingdom became much restored. Gaunt died of natural causes on February 3 1399 at Leicester Castle, with his beloved third wife Katherine by his side. Their abiding love and union altered the course of English history as we know it today.<br>
<br>
John of Gaunt's later marriages and descendants<br>
Blanche died in 1369. In 1371, John married Constanza of Castile, daughter of King Peter I of Castile, thus giving him a claim on the kingdom of Castile, which he would pursue unsuccessfully.<br>
<br>
In the meantime, John of Gaunt had fathered four children by a mistress, Katherine Swynford (whose sister married the poet, Geoffrey Chaucer). Constanza died in 1394. He married Katherine in 1396 or 1397, and their children, the Beauforts, were legitimized but barred from inheriting the throne. From the eldest son, John, came a granddaughter, Margaret Beaufort, whose son, later King Henry VII of England, would nevertheless claim the throne.<br>
<br>
John of Gaunt's legitimate son from his first marriage, Henry Bolingbroke, proved less of a diplomat than his father, and Richard II banished him from the kingdom in 1398. When John of Gaunt died in 1399, his estates were declared forfeit to the crown. This caused Bolingbroke to return, and he deposed the unpopular Richard to reign as King Henry IV of England (1399-1413).<br>

</p>
 GAUT
<p>
<a name ="I010798"><b>[I010798]</b></a><br />
Gaut, Gauti and Guti are name forms based on the same Proto-Germanic root. Gapt is by many considered to be a corruption of Gaut (Gaut?Gavt?Gaft?Gapt, cf. eftir and eptir, "after" in Old Norse).<br>
<br>
The names may represent the eponymous founder of an early tribe, *G(a)utoniz (?), ancestral to the Gautar (Geats), Gutans (Goths) and Gutar (Gotlanders). Gaut was one of Odin's names and the name forms are thought to be echoes of an ancient ancestry tradition among Germanic tribes, such as that of Yngvi and the Ingaevones.<br>
<br>
Some versions of the English royal line of Wessex add names above that of Woden, purportedly giving Woden's ancestry, though the names are now usually thought be in fact another royal lineage that has been at some stage erroneously pasted onto the top of the standard genealogy. Some of these genealogies end in Geat, whom it is reasonable to think might be Gaut. The account in the Historia Britonum calls Geat a son of a god which fits. But Asser in his Life of Alfred writes instead that the pagans worshipped this Geat himself for a long time as a god. In Old Norse texts Gaut is itself a very common byname for Odin.<br>
<br>
Jordanes in The origin and deeds of the Goths traces the line of the Amelungs up to Hulmul son of Gapt, purportedly the first Gothic hero of record. This Gapt is felt by many commentators to be an error for Gaut or Gauti.<br>
<br>
The Gutasaga, which treats the history of Gotland before its Christianization, begins with Tielvar and his son Havde, who had three sons, Graip, Guti and Gunfjaun, who were the ancestors of the Gotlanders, the Gutar (which is originally the same name as Goths).<br>

Algaut GAUTREKSSON
<p>
<a name ="I008122"><b>[I008122]</b></a><br />
Algaut was a Geatish king who ruled West Götaland according to the Heimskringla. Snorri Sturluson relates that he was burnt to death by his son-in-law, the Swedish king Ingjald ill-ruler.<br>
</p>
Gautrek GAUTSSON
<p>
<a name ="I008123"><b>[I008123]</b></a><br />
Gautrek it seems was mentioned in many tales, according to a passage near the end, for generosity and bravery but not for deep thinking. It is probable there were many more amusing ancecdotes to that effect that the author planned to include.<br>
<br>
The tale begins with one explanation of Gautrek's strangeness, relating how Gautrek's father-to-be, King Gauti of West Götaland, became lost while hunting and spent the night in a isolated homestead of strange, arguably insane, backwoods bumpkins: a stingy farmer named Skafnörtung 'Skinflint', his equally stingy wife Tötra 'Tatters', and their three sons and three daughters. That night Gauti fathered fathered Gautrek on Snotra who was the eldest of the farmer's daughters and supposedly the most intelligent of the bunch. The account bristles with grisly humor as it relates how one by one the members of this family of boobies committed suicide over the most trivial losses until at last only Snotra and her child survived. At that point Snotri took the child Gautrek to Gauti's court and King Gauti, years later on his deathbed, made Gautrek his heir.<br>
<br>
Then, in a very different style, the story jumps to an account of the ancestry, birth, and earliest exploits of Starkad who is perhaps the grimest and strangest of Scandinavian legendary heroes. This account was probably extracted or retold from a lost saga about Starkad and included only because King Vikar, who appears prominently in it, is father of Jarl Neri who plays a very important role in the material following and also because Eirı́k king of Sweden who appears in it was prominent in Hrólfs saga Gautrekssonar. A high point of this section is the evocative episode where Starkad's foster-father Grani Horsehair awakened his foster-son Starkad at about midnight, took him to an island where eleven men were at council, and sitting in a twelfth chair revealed himself as the god Odin. A long dialogue occurred between the gods Thor and Odin in which Thor and Odin alternately bestowed different curses and blessings upon Starkad.<br>
<br>
The tale then tells of Gautrek's marriage to Alfhild daughter of King Harald of Wendland and Alfhild's subsequent death by illness years later for which reason the grieving Gauthrek went somewhat out of his mind, ignored all matters of state, and spent all his time on Alfhild's burial mound, flying his hawk.<br>
<br>
The final section is an account of folk tale kind relating how Ref, the lazy son of a farmer, forced his father's stupendous ox as gift upon the stingy but extraorindarily intelligent Jarl Neri and requested only Neri's advice in return. Jarl Neri normally never accepted gifts because he was too stingy to repay them. But he took the ox and gave Ref a whetstone in return, telling him how to employ it as a gift to King Gautrek to get greater wealth. On Neri's advice, Ref visted king after king, in each case giving part or all of that which he received from the previous king and getting in return a greater gift. At last, through Neri's advice and trickery, Ref gained the hand of Gautrek's daughter Helga and an earldom that Neri held from King Gautrek.<br>
