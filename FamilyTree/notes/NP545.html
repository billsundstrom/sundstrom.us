Forrest Arthur THROOP
<p>
<a name ="I051043"><b>[I051043]</b></a><br />
FORREST THROOP'S REAL CAREER BEGAN AFTER A FALL ENDED HIS FIRST<br>
The accident, a small slip and a long fall, changed Forrest Throop 's life, although it was years before he realized just how much.<br>
In 1960, while working on a roof, Forrest slipped and fell to the ground. The resulting back injury kept him in and out of hospitals for years and eventually ended his carpentry career.<br>
Between the constant pain and the lack of mobility, Forrest searched for an escape. He found it in woodwork. He spent hours creating children's toys and figurines, jewelry and decorator accessories.<br>
The work saved his sanity.<br>
Forrest died April 3 at the age of 71, felled by a sudden heart attack that took him in a matter of minutes. But his legacy lives on in the artwork he left behind.<br>
Forrest was born March 28, 1926, in Tama, Iowa. During World War II, he enlisted in the Navy and became a cook. Eventually, he ended up at Treasure Island. When the war ended, he left the Navy and immediately went to work as a carpenter in Livermore, Concord and Martinez.<br>
Friends teased him that his interest in carpentry must have come from his woodsy name, Forrest. But the love of woodworking was something born with him. The feel of the grain beneath his hands, the smell of fresh sawdust, the joy of turning a block of wood into something functional and beautiful. Those were the things that filled Forrest's life.<br>
His father had taught him some about woodworking. Buddies in the Navy taught him some more, and the men he worked with on carpentry jobs gave him more tips. He would carefully watch a master carpenter build a cabinet or a table, then he'd try it himself. More times than not, he produced a work of art.<br>
In the meantime, life moved on. He married, had four children, divorced. Recovering from back surgery and living in a Martinez hotel, fate stepped to shape Forrest's future.<br>
On July 4, 1961, Forrest entered the hotel and came face-to-face with its lovely young switchboard operator. Their eyes locked and she fell instantly in love with him. His eyes, Maryanne says, seemed to look into her soul. He had beautiful hands, too. Strong yet graceful. He was as much in love with her as she was him.<br>
Maryanne and Forrest talked of getting married shortly after they met. They held out for four months and had a November wedding. Suddenly, they were a family of eight Forrest, Maryanne, Forrest's four children and Maryanne's two children from a previous marriage.<br>
Forrest returned to work, but his back still bothered him. He had another operation, then another and another. Eventually, he had six surgeries, but none fixed him up. Forrest became a contractor, but as the pain increased, his mobility decreased and in 1975, he retired.<br>
Retirement was hard on Forrest. He didn't know what to do with himself, and the inactivity allowed him to focus on his pain. He was going crazy, Maryanne says, looking for something to do. Soon, he was out in the carport with his saws and tools, making children's toys planes, trains, cars.<br>
Forrest became a regular at the arts and crafts shows. He sold his toys and took lessons from other crafters, who taught him to nurture his natural talent for carving. Before long, Forrest was practicing marquetry creating gorgeous wooden inlaid tables and lamps and little doodads. He became a staple at the "Arts in the Park" shows.<br>
When his back so got so bad he couldn't use his power tools any more, Forrest moved his hobby indoors and began carving jewelry, creating earrings and pins in the shapes of dolphins, whales, dogs and cats. Then he began carving figurines and finally, miniatures.<br>
Forrest sold much of his work at Crafter's Junction in Martinez. Many of his figurines and miniatures are still available there. Shortly before his death, Forrest had delivered a new shipment to the store.<br>
Forrest's death was so sudden and so unexpected, there had been no time to say goodbye. Maryanne says it is somewhat comforting to know that part of Forrest lives on in his work.<br>
In addition to Maryanne, his wife for 36 years, Forrest is survived by his daughter, Patricia Lindahl of Gualala; sons, Chris Throop of Antioch, Michael Throop of Martinez and Keith Throop of Santa Rosa; stepsons, Donald Luperi of Minden, Nev., and Michael Luperi of Bothell, Wash.; sisters, Ardis O'Brien of Watertown, Wis., and Arlene Otto of Marshalltown, Iowa; five grandchildren; and two great-grandchildren.<br>
He was a member of the Carpenters Union in Martinez, and the Marquetry Society.<br>
Forrest was buried at San Joaquin Valley National Cemetery in Santa Nella. Memorial gifts may be made to favorite charities.<br>

Radegunda of THURINGIA
<p>
<a name ="I010068"><b>[I010068]</b></a><br />
Radegund was born to King Berthar, one of the three kings of Thuringia (a kingdom located in present day Germany), some time in the first half of the 6th century.<br>
<br>
Radegund's uncle, Hermanfrid, killed Berthar in battle, orphaning her. Then, after allying with the Frankish King Theuderic, Hermanfrid defeated his other brother Baderic. However, having crushed his brothers and seized control of Thuringia, Hermanfrid reneged on his deal with Theuderic to share sovereignty.<br>
<br>
In 531 Theuderic returned to Thuringia with his brother Clotaire I. Together they defeated Hermanfrid and conquered his kingdom. Clotaire I also took charge of Radegund, taking her back to Merovingian Gaul with him and making her his wife.<br>
<br>
Radegund was one of Clotaire I ºs four wives (the other three being Chunsina, Ingund and Ingund ºs sister Aregund). She bore him no children, and, after Clotaire I had her brother assassinated, she turned to God, founding a nunnery in Poitiers.<br>
<br>
She was a friend of the poet Venantius Fortunatus and a contemporary of Gregory of Tours. She died on 13 August 586 and her funeral, which both men attended, was three days later.<br>
