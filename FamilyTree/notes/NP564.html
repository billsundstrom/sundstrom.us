<p>
<a name ="I018307"><b>[I018307]</b></a><br />
Lisa Lynnette Vrooman of Lodi, CA, passed away from cancer at her home on Friday, March 10, 2017 at the age of 56. She was born in San Gabriel, CA on December 28, 1960 and placed into the loving arms of her adoptive parents Ray and Arlene (Clewett) Vrooman at age four days. She lived and was schooled in Fullerton, CA until December, 1973 when the family moved to the newly purchased Walnut Grove Marina in Walnut Grove, CA, where she worked side by side with her father until his death in 2008 and the marina was sold.<br>
My amazing daughter went to be with God and her loved ones as she truly believed she would. She left a trail of broken hearts behind. Lisa loved people, all people. She knew everyone by first name at the places she frequented; markets, restaurants and the bank. When she asked "How is your day going?", she really wanted to know. She was kind, loving and most of all, compassionate. She was everyone's caregiver. She always paid it forward. She fiercely loved her family, friends and animals. Lisa loved holidays and parties, especially if they were with little kids. She loved to cook and with that skill she turned a new neighborhood into a family with once a week pot-lucks. At Christmastime her specialty was biscuits and gravy distributed to all her friends. Once while buying the groceries for this at Raley's, she was talking to the checker and the lady behind her commented that she "loved biscuits and gravy". Lisa's reply was a quick "give me your address and I will bring you some", and she did. She was my daughter who grew to be my friend, my shopping buddy, my everything.<br>
She is survived by her daughter Heather Pratt Vuica (Joseph) of Surprise, AZ; her mother, Arlene Vrooman of Woodbridge, CA; Brothers Gary Vrooman (Kay) of Sacramento, CA and Steve Vrooman (Norma) of Moreno Valley, CA; and biological sister Terri Bellin Mutch (Thomas) of Schertz, TX. She was preceded in death by her father, Ray Vrooman and first husband and friend forever, Stuart Pratt, and two biological brothers, Richard and Marty Bellin, and far too many close friends and family. At her request, there will be no services. Her desire was to be cremated and swim with the dolphins.<br>

Raymond Gilbert VROOMAN
<p>
<a name ="I001730"><b>[I001730]</b></a><br />
VROOMAN, Ray G. Marina Owner Surrounded by his family, longtime owner and operator of Walnut Grove Marina died Saturday evening, May 17, 2008 at Lodi Memorial Hospital from congestive heart and renal failure. He was 74 years old. Ray was born on Christmas Day, 1933 in Huntington Park, CA. He was the first of three sons born to Nevon E. and Esther (Gilbert) Vrooman. He was raised and schooled in that city, as was his high school sweetheart, Arlene Clewett. They were married November 14, 1953 in South Gate, California and lived in that area until 1961 when they relocated to Fullerton in Orange County with their three children. Ray was very athletic in his youth, playing varsity baseball and football. Upon graduation he refused a college football scholarship to pursue a tool and die apprenticeship, which in time, led to a very successful business career. He was President and co-owner of Atlas Fabricators in Long Beach, California, a hugely successful company founded in 1957 and located on 20 acres with buildings totaling about 300,000 square feet of floor space. The company was a major supplier of stampings, assemblies and other products to truck manufacturers, automotive accessory producers, the electric and plumbing industries and the Government. He held the office as President of the Southern California Tool & Die Assoc. and traveled extensively to foreign countries on trade missions; Mexico, Japan and Russia among them. In 1973, heart health issues forced a change of lifestyle. After a family vacation houseboating on the delta, they purchased the marina and relocated to Walnut Grove and everyone went to work! He was dedicated to making it a family-oriented facility. There were "Friday Night Steak Frys" and he did the grilling, 4th of July contests and fireworks, Easter egg hunts, and decorated yacht parades to name a few. So many good memories and a few bad ones like fire and flood. But, he persevered and in 34 years the "retired man" tripled the marina's size. Through the years he was a member of the Lutheran church, Woodbridge Golf & Country Club, B.P.O.E. Elks, Rotary Club, and other business associations. He is survived by his wife, Arlene of Woodbridge; two sons, Steve Vrooman of Moreno Valley and Gary Vrooman of Sacramento; one daughter, Lisa Vrooman of Walnut Grove; one granddaughter, Heather (Joe) Vuica of Phoenix, AZ; two brothers, Walter (Joanne) Vrooman of Santa Maria and Warren (Beth) of Fountain Valley; many nieces, nephews, extended family and a multitude of friends that will miss him greatly. A Celebration of Life will be held Saturday, June 7 from 12-5pm at Walnut Grove Marina. For more information, call 916-776-1181. In lieu of flowers, memorial contributions may be given to Lucile Packard Children's Hospital (Stanford University) 400 Hamilton Ave, Ste 340, Palo Alto, Ca 94301, Animal Friends Connection Humane Society, PO Box 2314, Lodi, Ca 95241, or the charity of your choice. <br>

<a name ="I120331"><b>[I120331]</b></a><br />
It is with great sadness that we report the death of Joan Anne Blanche (Waddell) Carr of Fredericton, NB on November 6th, as the result of complications from cancer. Joan was born in Ottawa on March 12, 1936, the daughter of William and Helen (Van Wart) Waddell. Survived by her children Jodi (Leonard) Lee-White and Jennifer (Charles Wilby) Carr of Fredericton, she was the proud grandmother to Alec and Nina Lee-White and Molly and Zakk Wilby. She is also survived by her dear sister June Greig of Edmonton, as well as many nieces and nephews across Canada. Joan was predeceased by her parents, a brother William Waddell, and sons Bruce and Jeffrey Carr. Joan left home at an early age and travelled the country before enlisting with the Royal Canadian Navy, serving on HMCS Cornwallis and Stadacona. After raising a family and working in a local doctorʼs office, she attended UNB to earn her B.A and M.A. in Sociology. She then worked for a number of years as a social worker for the Childrenʼs Aid Society in Sault Ste. Marie and Brampton, ON, but retired to Fredericton to be closer to her grandchildren. Well read, Joan had strong beliefs in opportunities and equality for all, especially women and children.<br>
At Joan's request, there will be a private family viewing, followed by a gathering of friends and family for a joyful celebration of her life, to be held at the Fredericton Train Station on Friday, November 15th, from 5:30 to 8:00 pm. In lieu of flowers, donations may be made via the McAdamʼs Funeral Home to the Mgr-Henri-Cormier Lodge in Moncton, where she was treated so well during her treatments -- a place where she made many beautiful friends and wonderful memories under such unlikely circumstances, for which she was very thankful.
