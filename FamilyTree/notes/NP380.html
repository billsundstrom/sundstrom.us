Olwen E Welk <br>
Saturday, August 09, 1913  -  Thursday, June 29, 2006<br>
Olwen Morgan Welk, age 92, of Ripon, passed away Thursday, June 29, 2006, at Ripon Medical Center. <br>
Born Olwen Evelyn Morgan on August 9, 1913 on the family farm outside of Pickett, Wisconsin to Moses and Martha Morgan, Olwen Welk died at nearly 93 years of age. Olwen grew up on Oak Grove Farm or "Tyddyn Llwyn Derw", attended country school, and graduated from Ripon High School and the Oshkosh Business College. She married Erwin Harold Welk on November 25, 1936 and lived in Ripon at 321 E. Sullivan Street for 65 years. She loved spending summers with family, grandchildren and friends at their Cottage #153 on Green Lake. <br>
Family, music, church and "all things Welsh" were the focus of her life. She and Erwin raised 4 children, but after Erwin died unexpectedly in 1962 at the age of 54, she returned to Oshkosh Business College to refresh her skills. Olwen then joined the Research and Development Department as secretary of what was then Speed Queen Washer and Dryer Company in Ripon and continued there until she retired 15 years later. She was involved in the Ripon Community, participating in the Ripon Hospital Auxiliary, Ripon Fest Parade, Dickens of a Christmas, and numerous other community events; she frequently supplied "period costumes" to various groups.<br>
She was "born into music". Not only did she enjoy all kinds of music, she was a performer, conductor and composer. Her childhood experiences involved singing with her family members, and with groups in their church, school and community choirs, as well as giving readings and performing in plays at church and school. She played both piano and guitar. Peniel Gymanfa Ganus (Festival of Hymn Singing) were significant occasions. The family would attend other regional Gymanfa Ganus throughout the state as well as in neighboring states. <br>
In 1957, Olwen began conducting Gymanfas and in 1959, she studied conducting with Ripon College Professor Edwin Wilson. Subsequently, she directed many church groups, the childrenʼs choir, the youth choir, and the chancel choir. In Wisconsin, she conducted the Rockhill Gymanfa Ganu in the original 1851 Chapel for 42 years as well as Gymanfas throughout the state. She was also selected to conduct Gymanfa Ganus in the states of Pennsylvania, Ohio, Indiana, Minnesota, Nebraska, Kansas, Colorado, and Oregon, and in New York City and San Francisco. <br>
Olwen enjoyed poetry and writing words to music, adding verses to known hymns, or writing new words to existing hymns so they would be appropriate for some current project theme, or composing both the words and the music. Her good friend, Ann Davies Thomas, wrote the music for "Niagara" to commemorate the 50th anniversary Golden Jubilee of the Welsh National Gymanfa Ganu Association (1929-1979) and Olwen wrote the words to this music which was sung at the National Gymanfa in Niagara Falls in 1979. In addition to the Niagara composition, she wrote the music and words for 2 other hymns: the "Consecration Hymn" and "The Light from the Cross" as well as sacred verses for the Welsh National Anthem, named "Our Heritage". <br>
Her church was central to her existence. Olwen was a member of Immanuel United Methodist Church for 70 years. In addition to her musical contributions, she taught Sunday School for various ages as well as Vacation Bible School and Confirmation Classes. Olwen was involved in various capacities with the womenʼs groups, served for several years on Immanuel's Administration Board and as a District Officer of United Methodist Women. In addition to conducting, she was a member of the Chancel Choir until she was 90 years old. <br>
Olwen LOVED being Welsh. Peniel Chapel, known as "Capel Cymraeg", outside of Pickett was the church of her youth and so remained an important church to her throughout her life. She was a member of the local St. Davidʼs Society as well as the Druids, a Welsh womenʼs group. Olwen and family members attended approximately 41 National Gymanfa Ganus throughout the country and Canada. In 1969, she and her sister, Ilah, traveled to Wales to witness the investiture of Prince Charles at Caernarfon Castle and attended the subsequent International Gymanfa Ganu in Cardiff. Although raised in an English-speaking household, she learned to speak Welsh. She served as vice president, president and secretary of the Wisconsin State Gymanfa Ganu Association. In 1991, 1997 and 2002, Olwen was recognized by state, national and international Welsh organizations for many years of dedicated service to Welsh heritage and Welsh organizations. Along with others, she was involved in revising the Wisconsin State Gymanfa Ganu Associationʼs Hymnbook. When asked to name her favorite Welsh hymn, she replied, "all of them". <br>
She is survived by her 4 children and their spouses, Robert Wayne and Judy Welk of Omaha, NE, Elizabeth Anne and Roger Griffith of Scotts Valley, CA, Thomas Morgan and Holly Welk of Green Lake/Markesan and Mary Gwendolyn and Randy Steffen of Ripon as well as her sister, Ilah Enid Morgan of Ripon and nephew, Lynn Erwin Morgan of Pickett. She was preceded in death by her husband, Erwin Harold Welk in 1962, as well as her brother and sister-in-law, Lee Edward and Nora Morgan, sister-in-law Florence Harpe, and brother-in-law and sister-in-law Franklin and Laura Welk. Additionally, she is survived by 11 grandchildren and 12 great-grandchildren. She had many friends in the church, community and in the state and nationwide Welsh Community.<br>
Olwen Morgan Welk lived a long, strong, loving, energetic and productive life.<br>
Visitation will be held on Friday evening, July 7, 2006 from 5 to 8 pm at the Butzin-Marchant Funeral Home, 515 Mayparty Drive, Ripon, Wisconsin.<br>
Funeral Services are scheduled for Saturday, July 8, 2006 at 11 AM at Immanuel United Methodist Church, corner of Elm Street and Hwy. 23 in Ripon, followed by burial in Woodlawn Cemetery, Ripon, Wisconsin.<br>

A submission about Delbert's sister Claire:<br>
Claire is the nineth child of ten proven children of William and Effa Morris. I'd like to remind people of the time frame that this family went through, 1900's to 1920's. To make a long story short. Claire's oldest sister Etta left home leaving her daughter with Effa & Wm. A few years later after Delbert was born Effa left Wm. leaving Wm to to take care of three very young children. Wm couldn't take care of them. The Idaho Court took the kids from Wm & placed them in the Northwest Children's Home in Lewiston, ID. Claire his brother Delbert & Alice the granddaughter were the children placed in the Home. From what we could gather talking with Ida that was a very bad time for the kids. Claire married Elinor in 1934, & had two daughters. Claire & Elinor are resting next to each other. If Claire's family reads this we would love to hear from them. <br>
