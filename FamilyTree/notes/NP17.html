<h2>Notes</h2>
Adalbert of AUSTRIA
<p>
<a name ="I007812"><b>[I007812]</b></a><br />
Adalbert the Victorious (died May 26, 1055 in Melk) war Margrave of Austria from 1018 until his death. He extended the Eastern border of the then small Eastern Mark of Bavaria as far as the rivers Morava/March and Leitha and supported King Henry III in his battles against Hungary and Bohemia. He resided in the Lower Austrian Babenberg castle of Melk, where Stift Melk was to develop later.<br>
</p>
Leopold I of AUSTRIA
<p>
<a name ="I007823"><b>[I007823]</b></a><br />
From Wikipedia<br>
<br>
Leopold I, also Luitpold or Liutpold, (died 994 in Würzburg) was the first Margrave of Österreich from the Babenberg dynasty.<br>
<br>
Leopold was a count in the Bavarian Danube district and first appears in documents from the 960s as a faithful follower of Emperor Otto I the Great. After the insurgence by Henry II the Wrangler of Bavaria in 976 against Emperor Otto II, he was appointed as "markgrave in the East", the core territory of modern Austria, instead of a Burkhard. His residence was probably at Pöchlarn, but maybe already Melk, where his successors resided. The territory, which originally had only coincided with the modern Wachau, was enlarged in the east at least as far as the Wienerwald.<br>
<br>
Leopold is the first reasonably known historical figure in Austria. The milennial anniversary of his appointment as markgrave was therefor celebrated as Thousand years of Austria in 1976 - celebrations under the same title were held twenty years later at the anniversary of the famous Ostarrichi document first mentioning the Old German name of Austria.<br>
<br>
Even though he is not mentioned in the Babenberger Chronicle written by his descendant Otto of Freising (which only starts with Leopold's grandson Adalbert) he is known as the progenitor of this dynasty, which put its stamp on Austria. Otto of Freising's claim of ancestry to the Franconian Babenbergers, who are remembered for the Babenberger insurgency of the early 10th century, has not been proven, but cannot be completely ruled out.<br>
</p>
Leopold III of AUSTRIA
<p>
<a name ="I007712"><b>[I007712]</b></a><br />
From Wikipedia<br>
<br>
<br>
Leopold III (born 1073; died November 15, 1136), Margrave of Austria 1095-1136, also known as Saint Leopold (his feast day being November 15), patron saint of Austria in general and of Vienna, Lower Austria and jointly with Saint Florian of Upper Austria in particular.<br>
<br>
Leopold was the son of Margrave Leopold II and Ida of Formbach-Ratelnberg; his sons were Leopold IV and Henry II Jasomirgott. His second wife was Agnes, the sister of Emperor Henry V, since he had supported the latter against his father Henry IV. This connection to the Salians raised the importance of the House of Babenberg, to which important royal rights on the territory of its margraviate were granted. Leopold called himself "Princeps Terrae", which rose from a consciousness of independent territorial rule. He was considered as a candidate for the election of the King of Germany in 1125, but declined this opportunity.<br>
<br>
He is mainly remembered for the development of the country, which is associated with him founding monasteries. His most important foundation is Klosterneuburg (1108). According to legend, the Lady Mary appeared to him and led him to a position where he found the veil of his wife Agnes, lost years before. At that place, the monastery of Klosterneuburg was founded. He subsequently expanded this city to become his residence.<br>
<br>
Other foundations were Heiligenkreuz, Kleinmariazell and Seitenstetten. All of those induced the church to canonize him in 1485. In fact, the monasteries served the purpose of developing a territory still largely covered by forest at that time.<br>
<br>
Leopold also fostered the development of cities, namely besides Klosterneuburg and Vienna also Krems, which was endowed with a mint, which, however, never attained great importance.<br>
<br>
The first literary texts from the area of Austria date back to Leopold's time, which are the writings of Henry of Melk and Ava of Göttweig.<br>
<br>
He is buried in the Klosterneuburg monastary, which owes him its existence. In 1663, under the rule of his namesake Emperor Leopold I he was declared patron saint of Austria instead of Saint Koloman. There is no school on November 15 in Vienna, Lower Austria and Upper Austria.<br>

James AVERY
<p>
<a name ="I005921"><b>[I005921]</b></a><br />
Capt. James Avery, the only child of Christopher, was born 1620. Cameto America with his father, and lived at Gloucester for several years. The Rev. Mr. Blinman, who had been minister of Gloucester for eight years, was engaged to become the minister of the Pequot Plantation. Aparty of his friends proposed to move with him, and came on to make preparatory arrangements, Oct. 19, 1650. It appears that James Avery went back to Gloucester sold his possession there to his father[Christopher], and in 1651 returned to New London. In March of that year the principal body of these eastern families arrived. Capt. James acquired large tracts of land at what is now Poquonoc Bridge, Groton, east of New London. About 1656 he built the hive of the Avery's at the head of Poquonoc Plain, a mile and a half from the river Thames. In 1684, the old Blinman edifice, first church of New London, the unadorned church's and water-tower of the wilderness, which had stood for thirty years, was sold to Capt. Avery for six pounds, with the condition that he should remove it in one month's time. According to tradition, the church was taken down, it [sic] materials carried across the river, and added to the house he had already built at Poquonoc. In spite of this analytic and synthetic process, the ancient dwelling seemed to have retained some of its sacred character, for a century later it was occupied until July 21, 1894, when a spark from a passing, locomotive ignited its well seasoned frame, and in a short time only ancient chimney remained to mark the spot of this historic house of Eastern Connecticut. A few years later the chimney was, taken down, the grounds graded, and a tasteful monument was erected by the descendants of James Avery. He was ensign, lieutenant and Captain of the New London companies and served throughout King Phillip's war in command of forty Indians from Stonington, New London and Lyme. In 1676 he was captain of one of the four companies which protected the frontier, and for twenty-three years an officer of the town, and twelve times deputy to the General Court, 1656-80; also assisting Judge in the Prerogative Court, and was most prominent in matters relating to the church, as references to him in such connections are numerous. He married 1st Nov. 10 1643, Jonna Greenslade, born about 1622. She died after 1693. He married 2nd.Abigail (Ingraham) Chesebrough, widow of Joshua Holmes, July 4, 1698, #2 Holmes Family. He died April 18, 1700. His widow was living as late as 1714.<br>
-----------------------------<br>
James Avery was baptized at Wolborough, Devonshire (near Abbotskerswell) on Apr 22,1621, the son of Christopher Avery and Margaret (Abraham) Stevens Avery of Ipplepen, Co.Devonshire, England. Christopher Avery, along with his son James, migrated to Groton,CT about 1636. Christopher's wife (James' mother) Margaret never came to New England. In fact, she died in 1626, and Christopher Avery married Alice Berdon in 1630 in England. Christopher and James left Alice behind in England, never to return.<br>
All Averys in America descend from either this James Avery or from another Avery immigrant progenitor, William Avery of Dedham. It is not yet proven whether any relationship exists between the two Avery branches.<br>
His first wife was Joanna Greenslade Avery, married at Gloucester,MA on Nov 10,1643. His second wife was Abigail (Ingraham) Cheeseboro Holmes Avery, the widow of Samuel Cheeseboro and of Joshua Holmes, married July 4,1698. (Her marriage to James Avery was brief....she is buried under the name of Abigail Holmes.)<br>
Children(by first marriage): Hannah Avery Minor, James Avery Jr, Mary Avery Minor, Thomas Avery, John Avery, Rebecca Avery Potts, Jonathan Avery, Christopher Avery, and Samuel Avery. <br>
Children:<br>
  Hannah Avery Minor (1644 - 1721)<br>
  James Avery (1646 - 1728)<br>
  Mary Avery Minor (1648 - 1708)<br>
  Thomas Avery (1651 - 1736)<br>
  John Avery (1654 - 1724)<br>
  Rebecca Avery Potts (1656 - 1707)<br>
  Jonathan Avery (1659 - 1681)<br>
