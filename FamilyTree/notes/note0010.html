Charles II, known as the Lame (Fr. le Boiteux) (born c. 1248, died 5 May 1309, Naples) was the King of Naples and Sicily, titular king of Jerusalem, and Prince of Salerno. He was a son of Charles I of Naples.<br />
 <br />
He had been captured by Roger of Lauria in the naval battle at Naples in 1284. When his father died, he was still a prisoner of Peter III of Aragon.<br />
 <br />
In 1288 King Edward Longshanks mediated to make peace, and Charles was liberated only to retain Naples alone. Sicily was left to the Aragonese. Charles was also to induce his cousin Charles of Valois to renounce for twenty thousand pounds of silver the kingdom of Aragon which given him by Pope Martin IV to punish Peter for having invaded Sicily, but which the Valois had never effectively occupied.<br />
 <br />
Charles was then released, leaving three of his sons and sixty Provençal nobles as hostages, promising to pay 30,000 marks and to return a prisoner if the conditions were not fulfilled within three years. He went to Rieti, where the new Pope Nicholas IV, immediately absolved him from all the conditions he had sworn to observe, crowned him King of Sicily in 1289, and excommunicated King Alfonso III of Aragon. Charles of Valois, in alliance with Castile, prepared to take possession of Aragon. Alfonso, being hard pressed, had to promise to withdraw the troops he had sent to help his brother James in Sicily, to renounce all rights over the island, and pay a tribute to the Holy See.<br />
 <br />
Alfonso died childless in 1291 before the treaty could be carried out, and James took possession of Aragon, leaving the government of Sicily to the third brother Frederick.<br />
 <br />
The new Pope Boniface VIII, elected in 1294 at Naples under the auspices of King Charles, mediated between the latter and James, and a most dishonourable treaty was signed: James was to marry Charlesʼs daughter Bianca and was promised the investiture by the pope of Sardinia and Corsica, while he was to leave the Angevin a free hand in Sicily and even to assist him if the Sicilians resisted.<br />
 <br />
An attempt was made to bribe Frederick into consenting to this arrangement, but being backed up by his people he refused, and was afterwards crowned king of Sicily. The ensuring war was fought on land and sea but Charles, though aided by the pope, his cousin Charles of Valois and James, was unable to conquer the island, and his son the prince of Taranto was taken prisoner at the battle of La Falconara in 1299. Peace was at last made in 1302 at Caltabellotta. Charles gave up all rights to Sicily and agreed to the marriage of his daughter Leonora and King Frederick; the treaty was ratified by the pope in 1303. Charles spent his last years quietly in Naples, which city he improved and embellished. He died in August 1309, and was succeeded by his son Robert the Wise.<br />
 <br />
In 1270, he married Maria of Hungary (c. 1257 - March 25, 1323), the daughter of Stephen V of Hungary. They had fourteen children:<br />
   1. Charles Martel d'Anjou, titular King of Hungary<br />
   2. Louis (February 9, 1275, Nocera - August 19, 1298, Chateau de Brignoles), Bishop of Toulouse<br />
   3. Robert of Naples, King of Naples<br />
   4. Philip I of Taranto, Prince of Achaea and Taranto, Despot of Romania, Lord of Durazzo, titular Emperor of Constantinople<br />
   5. Raymond Berengar (1281-1307), Count of Provence, Prince of Piedmont and Andria<br />
   6. John (1283 - aft. March 16, 1308), a priest<br />
   7. Tristan (1284-bef. 1288)<br />
   8. Peter (1291 - August 29, 1315, Battle of Montecatini), Count of Gravina<br />
   9. John of Gravina (1294 - April 5, 1336, Naples), Duke of Durazzo, Prince of Achaea, and Count of Gravina, married March 1318 (div 1321) Matilda of Hainault (November 29, 1293-1336), married November 14, 1321 Agnes of Périgord (d. 1345)<br />
  10. Marguerite (1273- December 31, 1299), Countess of Anjou and Maine, married at Corbeil August 16, 1290 Charles of Valois<br />
  11. Blanca (1280 - October 14, 1310, Barcelona), married at Villebertran November 1, 1295 James II of Aragon<br />
  12. Leonora, (August 1289 - August 9, 1341, Monastery of St. Nicholas, Arene), married at Messina May 17, 1302 Frederick III of Sicily<br />
  13. Maria (1290 - c. 1346), married at Palma de Majorca September 20, 1304 Sancho I of Majorca, married 1326 Jaime de Ejerica (1298 - April 1335)<br />
  14. Beatrice (1295 - c. 1321), married April 1305 Azzo VIII, Margrave d'Este (d. 1308), married 1309 Bertrand III of Baux, Count of Andria (d. 1351)<br />

Garcia Iniguez (d. 870) was King of Pamplona bef. 860-870. He was educated in Cordoba, as a guest of the Muslims.<br />
 <br />
He was the son of Eneko Aritza, the first king of this dynasty. When his father was stricken by paralysis in 842, he became Regent.<br />
 <br />
His kinsman Musa ibn Musa of Banu Qasi rebelled against the Cordoban emir in 843. This rebellion was put down by Emir Abd al-Rahman II, who also attacked the Kingdom of Pamplona, vanquishing Garcia Iniguez and Musa.<br />
 <br />
Garcia succeeded as undisputed monarch only after his kinsman, Ximeno Garces, heir of Alava, who had in 851/2 succeeded Aritza and united more territories to the new kingdom. In 860, the united Pamplonese and Navarrese gave the Crown to him.<br />
 <br />
In 859 a contingent of Vikings made an expedition to Navarrese lands. The Pamplonan government abandoned the old alliance with Banu Qasi and made a new pact with the kings of Asturias. Ordono I of Asturias and Garcia Iniguez triumphed in the Battle of Albelda in 859.<br />
 <br />
Garcia's son and heir Fortun was imprisoned by the Moors in 860 and was kept in Cordoba for the next 20 years.<br />
 <br />
Garcia I favored the pilgrims who travelled to Santiago de Compostela, and attempted to guarantee peace for that traffic.<br />
 <br />
Garcia zealously defended his country against the encroachments of Islam.<br />
 <br />
In 870, Garcia died. As his heir was in the hands of his enemies, a kinsman Garcia Jimenez governed the kingdom as Regent or even as co-king. Garcia's son Fortun Garces was released in 880, and when returned, became king of Pamplona.<br />
 <br />
Garcia I married firstly in 858 Oria (Leodegundis), daughter of Musà ibn Musà Ibn Fortún of Banu Qasi, and secondly Urraca Giménez, Countess of Aragón (852-870).<br />

Born: in 651 in Neustrie, son of Clovis II, King de Bourgogne and SainteBathilde. Some sources assert that Thierry III was born in 651 whileothers claim it was circa 654. Note - between 673 and 690: Thierri IIIbecame King of Neustrie upon the death of Clotaire III between 10 Marchand 15 May 673. The Crown was given him by Ebroin, Major Domo. It isEbroin's excesses which caused the Greats [Optimates] to rebel in 674 andto call upon Childeric II, King of Austrasia for help. Thierri III wasde-throned in 674 by Childeric II who died in 675 allowing Thierri III tore-claim the throne. In 674, he was shaven and relegated to Saint-Denis.Ebroin was exiled to the Monastery of Luxeuil [Haute-Saone]. In 676,Thierry III left Saint-Denis to become King of Neustria and of Burgundywith the help of Major Domo Leger. Ebroin, however, first supportsClotaire III, a son of Clovis III, and then he swings to Thierry III.<br />
 <br />
Thierry III for his part is first and foremost King of Neustria and of Burgundy and the Greats [Optimates] of Austrasia want a King of their own. Thus, they find Dagobert II, son of Sigebert III, who had been exiled in Ireland. For all practical purposes, Dagobert II is King of Austrasia, whereas Ebroin rules Neustria and Burgundy in the name of Thierry III. By 680, through the death in 679 of Dagobert II, Thierry III is sole King of Gaule. But in reality the antagonism between the Neustrians and the Austrasians was quite aggravated. Austrasia is at that time governed by the grandson of Pepin de Landen, Pepin II, who makes himself Duke of Austrasia, supported by his brother Martin. In the Summer of 680, the two armies join in battle at Leucofao [known today as Bois-du-Fay] in the Ardennes. The Austrasians are defeated and Pepin escapes. Martin is taken prisoner in Laon, where he had sought refuge. Ebroin had promised to let him live, and of course, he rushed to have him executed. Within 3 years Ebroin is himself assassinated by one Ermenfroy who takes refuge in Austrasia. In 687, Pepin II with the help of the Greats [Optimates] of Neustria, invades Neustria from the North-East. Though Thierry III was vanquished at the Battle of Tertry [three leagues from Saint-Quentin] by Pepin II, the latter still recognized Thierry III as King of Neustrie. Married before 674: Amalberge, daughter of Wandregisis and Farahild. Died: between March 691 and April 691.<br />
 <br />
Thierry III died in March or April, and his son Clovis IV succeeds him, though he is barely 9 years of age. Thus, Pepin II [Pepin of Herstal] remains the true ruler.<br />

King Eneko Aritza (Iñigo Iñiguez Arista, in Basque, Eneko Aritza) (c. 781-852) was the first King of Navarre in the 9th century.<br />
 <br />
He was apparently also count of Bigorre and Sobrarbe.<br />
 <br />
His parents were Íñigo Jiménez and Oneca.<br />
 <br />
Eneko's elder brother or kinsman, Garcia Jimenez, (had) held a veritable principality in Vasconia, the original Navarre.<br />
 <br />
After the death of his father, his mother married secondly Musá ibn Fortún, Lord of Banu Qasi, Muslim king of Tudela, who was one of the lords of Valley of Ebro. This marriage made Eneko influential over large territories in the Pyrenean valleys. Additionally, the clan of Banu Qasi controlled a long stretch of the fertile valley of the river Ebro.<br />
 <br />
The family of Velasco was a rival of Eneko and the Banu Qasi and the nucleus of the pro-French party in northern Spain. In 799, the pro-French party assassinated Mutarrif ibn Muza, Governor of Pamplona, who belonged to the family of Banu Qasi. A Velasco became governor and the French controlled Navarrese territories.<br />
 <br />
In 824 French counts Elbe and Aznar made another expedition against Pamplona. This led Eneko overthrow the Franks and pronounce the Kingdom of Pamplona. Eneko was a "Christicolae princeps" (Christian prince), according to Eulogio de Córdoba. This kingdom combined both Muslims and Christians to maintain independence against outside powers.<br />
 <br />
Abd al-Rahman II of Cordoba made some reprisal against Pamplona.<br />
 <br />
In 841 Eneko fell victim to paralysis. His son Garcia Iniguez acted as regent.<br />
 <br />
Eneko died in 851 or 852, and apparently was succeeded by his kinsman Jimeno Garces, lord, holder of Alava etc, apparently simultaneous ruler in Vasconia, now also king of Pamplona, thus uniting the two independent Basque terrotories. Eneko, however, also left a son, Garcia Iñiguez, who managed to become the sole king in c. 860. The Basque dynasty (in form of the Jimenez line) ruled Navarre from the 9th century to 1234. Eneko's own male line lost the throne in 905. Later kings of Pamplona were Eneko's descendants through the female line. Variations in the spelling of this Basque surname are Arista and Aiza.<br />
 <br />
 <br />
Eneko married Oneca Velázquez, daughter of don Velasco, lord of Pamplona, and had following children:<br />
    * Assona Íñiguez, wife of Musa ibn Musa ibn Fortún, lord of Tudela and Huesca.<br />
    * Garćıa Íñiguez, the future king.<br />
    * Galindo Íñiguez of Pamplona, father of:<br />
          Musa Ibn Galindo, Waĺı of Huesca 860, assassinated in 870 in Córdoba.<br />
    * Nunila, wife of count Garćıa "el Malo" (the Bad) of Aragón.<br />

Boleslaus III the Wrymouth (Boleslaw III Krzywousty), (1086-1138) was duke of Poland from 1102. He was a son of Ladislaus Herman of Poland and Judith of Bohemia, daughter of emperor Henry III. Boleslaus III was thus the brother in law of emperor Henry IV.<br />
 <br />
He defeated the Pomeranians at the battle of Naklo in 1109, and took control of Pomerania between 1119 and 1123, once again by conquest regaining temporary Polish access to the Baltic Sea. The government of the local Pomeranians was left in place. He also defeated Henry V, Holy Roman Emperor in 1109, in the Battle of Hundsfeld. However in 1135 he became a vassal of Henry's son Lothair II, Holy Roman Emperor, from whom he received the lien of Pomerania, Poland and Ruegen.<br />
 <br />
Boleslaus also campaigned in Hungary from 1132 to 1135, but to little effect.<br />
 <br />
First he married Zbyslava of Kiev, daughter of Sviatopolk II of Kiev grand duke of Kiev. They had one son:<br />
    * Ladislaus (b. 1105), King of Poland<br />
 <br />
Second he married Salome von Berg-Schelklingen, with whom he had 14 children (6 sons + 8 daughters) from whom we know of 4 sons and 5 daughters:<br />
    * Boleslaus IV the Curly (b. 1125)<br />
    * Mieszko III the Old (b. 1126)<br />
    * Henry of Sandomierz (b. 1127)<br />
    * Casimir the Just (b. 1138)<br />
    * Rycheza of Poland (b. 12 April 1116), married to grandduke Volodar<br />
    * Dobronega of Poland (b. 1128), married Markis Dietrich of Niederlausitz<br />
    * Gertruda of Poland<br />
    * Judith of Poland (b. 1132), married Otto I of Brandenburg<br />
    * Agnes of Poland (b. 1137), married Mstislav II of Kiev<br />
 <br />
Before his death in 1138 he announced the testament (Boleslaw the Wrymouth's testament) dividing his land between four of his sons. The "senioral principle" established in the testament stated, that at every time the oldest member of the dynasty was to have a supreme power over the rest and also control an indivisible "senioral part" - a vast stripe of land running N-S through the middle of Poland, with Krakow as the main city. Senior's prerogatives included also control over Pomerania, which was a fief of the Empire. The principle was quickly broken, which began an almost 200 years period of feudal dissolution in Poland.<br />

Leopold III (born 1073; died November 15, 1136), Margrave of Austria 1095-1136, also known as Saint Leopold (his feast day being November 15), patron saint of Austria in general and of Vienna, Lower Austria and jointly with Saint Florian of Upper Austria in particular.<br />
 <br />
Leopold was the son of Margrave Leopold II and Ida of Formbach-Ratelnberg; his sons were Leopold IV and Henry II Jasomirgott. His second wife was Agnes, the sister of Emperor Henry V, since he had supported the latter against his father Henry IV. This connection to the Salians raised the importance of the House of Babenberg, to which important royal rights on the territory of its margraviate were granted. Leopold called himself "Princeps Terrae", which rose from a consciousness of independent territorial rule. He was considered as a candidate for the election of the King of Germany in 1125, but declined this opportunity.<br />
 <br />
He is mainly remembered for the development of the country, which is associated with him founding monasteries. His most important foundation is Klosterneuburg (1108). According to legend, the Lady Mary appeared to him and led him to a position where he found the veil of his wife Agnes, lost years before. At that place, the monastery of Klosterneuburg was founded. He subsequently expanded this city to become his residence.<br />
 <br />
Other foundations were Heiligenkreuz, Kleinmariazell and Seitenstetten. All of those induced the church to canonize him in 1485. In fact, the monasteries served the purpose of developing a territory still largely covered by forest at that time.<br />
 <br />
Leopold also fostered the development of cities, namely besides Klosterneuburg and Vienna also Krems, which was endowed with a mint, which, however, never attained great importance.<br />
 <br />
The first literary texts from the area of Austria date back to Leopold's time, which are the writings of Henry of Melk and Ava of Göttweig.<br />
 <br />
He is buried in the Klosterneuburg monastary, which owes him its existence. In 1663, under the rule of his namesake Emperor Leopold I he was declared patron saint of Austria instead of Saint Koloman. There is no school on November 15 in Vienna, Lower Austria and Upper Austria.<br />

From a letter written by Alice's mother:<br />
You asked me in your letter how Alice got acquainted with Mr Turner. Well I will tell you. It was through a Matrimonal Paper while at Hatties in Excelsior, 3 years ago last fall. She happened to come across a peice of one printed in Chicago with Mr Turners add. in it. She answered it and he selected her from several others to correspond with. They coresponded three years. Last fall he proposed sending the money for her to meet him part way and her father to accompany her. After due reflection, she decided to do so. They met in Oklahoma City and were married there Dec 3rd, at noon and then took the afternoon train for his home. Father was very much pleased with him and his personal appearance. They seem to be well satisfied with each other. I get a long letter from her quite often. Mr Turner & bros. have 200 acres partly timber. They raise corn and cotten. She writes that they will have lots of fruit this season. Peaches, plums, grapes & berries with all kinds of vegitables. They have wild Dewberries. They are begining to turn now and such a variety of wild flowers, she writes.<br />

Agnes of Germany (1074 - September 24, 1143), was the daughter of HenryIV, Holy Roman Emperor and Bertha, daughter of Otto, Count of Maurienneand Adelaide.<br />
 <br />
She married firstly, in 1080, Frederick I, Duke of Swabia. They had several sons and daughters, amongst whom were Frederick II of Swabia (1090 - 1147) (the father of Frederick Barbarossa) and Conrad III of Germany (1093 - 1152).<br />
 <br />
Following Frederick's death in 1105, Agnes married secondly, Leopold III (born 1073; died 15 Nov. 1136), Margrave of Austria from 1095 to 1136. Leopold was the son of Margrave Leopold II and Ida of Formback-Ratelnberg. According to legend, a veil lost by Agnes and found by Leopold years later while hunting instigated him to found the monastery of Klosterneuburg.<br />
 <br />
Agnes and Leopold III were the parents of Agnes of Babenberg (d. January 25, 1157), who married, in 1125, Ladislaus the Exile of Poland, High Duke of Poland from 1138 to 1146. Agnes is said to have been "one of the most famous beauties of her time." A leader of the Crusade of 1101, she may have been captured and placed in the harem of Sultan Kilidj Arslan.<br />

 <br />
Carloman (716-754) was the son of Charles Martel, major domo or Mayor of the Palace of Austrasia and Chrotrud. He was a member of the family later called the Carolingians and it can be argued that he was instrumental in consolidating their power at the expense of the ruling Merovingian kings of the Franks.<br />
 <br />
After the death of his father in 741, power was initially divided among Carloman and his brothers Pippin III and Grifo. By 742, Carloman and Pippin had ousted Grifo, and each turned his attention towards his own area of influence as major domo, Pippin in the West and Carloman in the East.<br />
 <br />
Carloman strengthened his authority in part via his support of the Anglo-Saxon missionary Winfrid (Boniface), the so-called "Apostle of the Germans", whom he charged with restructuring the chuch in the Frankish Empire. This was in part a continuation of a policy begun under his grandfather Pippin of Herstal and continued to a lesser extent under Charles Martel. Carloman was instrumental in convening the Concilium Germanicum in 742, the first major Church synod to be held in the eastern parts of the Frankish kingdom. Chaired jointly by him and Boniface, the synod ruled that priests were not allowed to bear arms or to host females in their houses and that it was one of the primary tasks to eradicate pagan beliefs. While his father had frequently confiscated church property to reward his followers, Carloman sought to increase the assets of the church. He donated, for instance, the land for one of Boniface's most important foundation, the monastery of Fulda.<br />
 <br />
Carloman could be ruthless towards real or perceived opponents. In 746, he convened an assembly of all alamanni dukes and nobles at Cannstatt and then had most of them, numbering in the thousands, arrested and executed for high treason in the bloody judgment of Cannstatt. This eradicated virtually the entire tribal leadership of the Alamanni and ended the independence of the tribal duchy of Alamannia which was thereafter governed by counts appointed by their Frankish overlords.<br />
 <br />
These actions strengthened Carloman's position, and that of the family as a whole, especially in terms of their rivalries with other leading families such as the Bavarian Agilofings.<br />
 <br />
In 747, Carloman renounced his position as major domo and withdrew to a monastic life in Monte Soracte und Monte Cassino. He died on 17 July 754 and was buried in Monte Cassino.<br />

Robert de Torigny and the family of Gunnor, Duchess of Normandy by ToddA. Farmerie (modified from article that appeared in Dec 1996 onsoc.genealogy.medieval<br />
 <br />
"There is much confusion about this, mostly because people did not understand the original source material or never consulted it directly, basing their account on a previous author, who had confused it himself.<br />
 <br />
Gunnor had four known siblings - Arfast/Herfast, father of Osbern, guardian of William the Conqueror; Senfria/Sainsfrida, wife of the forester of St. Vaast d'Equiqueville; Wevia, wife of Osbert de Bolbec and mother of the "first" Walter Giffard; and Duvelina, wife of Turulf de Pont Audemer, and ancestor of the Beaumont family. She also had a long list of nieces. For the majority of these, we do not know for certain which of Gunnor's siblings was their parent, because the original source for Gunnor's family, Robert de Torigny, does not say. There is one exception, and that is Joscelina, mother of Roger de Moontgomery.<br />
 <br />
With Joscelina, the original document states only that "Roger was the son of one of Countess Gunnor's nieces and therefore held immense possessions in different parts of Normandy." However, in the author's own copy, he has added that this was "Joscelina, daughter of Wevia". In the same paragraph, the author states that Roger was son of Hugh de Montgomery. This results in a pedigree in which Roger is son of Hugh by Joscelina, daughter of Wevia.<br />
 <br />
This solution is in conflict with two other sources. One is a genealogy prepared in the 1110s by Bishop Ivo of Chartres. He was addressing the proposed marriage of a daughter of Roger de Montgomey to an illegitimate son of Henry I of England. He was documenting the fact that the two were too closely related to be allowed to marry. He shows that Roger de<br />
Montgomery was son of "Joscelina, daughter of Seufria" rather than daughter of Wevia. Given these two conflicting sources, we can only go on indirect evidence. Most important is the fact that Roger, through his link with Gunnor's niece, held immense possessions throughout Normandy. This would be more likely if Joscelina was a (co-)heiress of her parents, rather than being a daughter in a family where the majority of the property went to sons. Thus Senfria is the more likely parent, since Wevia had two sons, who would have gotten the bulk of her land.<br />
 <br />
The other conflict comes from a charter recorded at the monastery at Thorn, in which Roger was recorded as son of another Roger. Thus Robert de Torigny must be wrong in calling Roger son of Hugh. Some have 'solved' this problem by displacing Hugh with an earlier Roger, and making him the husband of Joscelina, but this breaks the linkage of Joscelina and Hugh suggested by Robert. An alternative now seems the prefered solution. In at least two other places, the author appears to have compacted two generations with the same name into one, so perhaps he has done it here, and that Roger was son of Roger, who in turn was son of Hugh and Joscelina. This solution is prefered chronologically, since Roger was a contemporary of William the Conqueror, and yet without the forgotten generatin, would be expected to have been much older.<br />
 <br />
Thus current thinking is that Roger de Montgomery (husband of Mabel de Belleme) was son of Roger, son of Hugh and Joscelina, daughter of Senfria, sister of Gunnor. " Todd A. Farmerie in an email response to questions about article<br />

Ferdinand I of Castile, known as El Magno or "the Great," (d. 1065), wasKing of Castille and King of Léon from 1035 to 1065.<br />
 <br />
Life<br />
Ferdinand was the eldest son of Sancho III of Navarre. He was barely in his teens when he was put in possession of Castile in 1028 with his father's backing, on the murder of the last Count, as the heir of his mother Munia , daughter of a previous count of Castile and sister of the deceased count. The count, Don Garćıa, was about to be married to Doña Sancha, sister of Bermudo, king of León, but was assassinated as he was entering the church of St.John Baptist in León by a party of Castilian nobles, exiles from their own land, who had taken refuge in Leon.<br />
 <br />
Ferdinand now married Sancha of Leon instead. He reigned in Castile with the title of king from 1033. His father king Sancho died in 1036, and Ferdinand became the "high king" of the dynasty. In 1038, when his brother-in-law Bermudo was killed in battle with Ferdinand at Tamaron, Ferdinand took possession of León as well, by right of his wife who was the heiress presumptive of Bermudo. He overran the Moorish section of Galicia, and set up his vassal as count in what is now northern Portugal. With northern Spain consolidated, Ferdinand, in 1056, proclaimed himself emperor of Hispania. The use of the title was resented by the emperor Henry II, Holy Roman Emperor supported by Pope Victor II in 1055, as implying a claim to the headship of Christendom, and as a usurpation on the Holy Roman Empire. It did not, however, mean more than that the sovereign of León was the chief of the princes of the peninsula, and that Spain was independent of the Empire. Ferdinand's brothers Garcia V of Navarre and Ramiro I of Aragon opposed his power, but were killed in ensuing battles.<br />
 <br />
Although Ferdinand had grown in higher power by this strife with Bermudo of León, and though at a later date he defeated and killed his brother Garćıa of Najera, he ranks high among the kings of Spain who have been counted religious, as religion often subconsciously favors violence. To a large extent he may have owed this reputation to the military victories over the Moors, in which he initiated the period of the Christian reconquest of the peninsula.<br />
 <br />
Santa Justa<br />
Ferdinand was probably a pious man. Towards the close of his reign he sent a special embassy to Seville to bring back the body of Santa Justa. The then king of Seville, Motadhid, one of the local princes who had divided the caliphate of Cordova, was himself a sceptic and poisoner, but he stood in wholesome awe of the power of the Christian king. He favoured the embassy in every way, and when the body of Santa Justa could not be found, helped the envoys, who were also aided by a vision seen by one of them in a dream, to discover the body of Isidore of Seville instead. The Doctor's body was reverently carried away to León, where the church of San Juan Bautista (St.John Baptist) was reconsecrated to receive the relics.<br />
 <br />
 <br />
Death<br />
Ferdinand died on the feast of Saint John the Evangelist, June 24, 1065, in León, with many manifestations of ardent piety, having laid aside his crown and royal mantle, dressed in the robe of a monk and lying on a bier covered with ashes, which was placed before the altar of the church of Saint Isidore.<br />
 <br />
At his death, Ferdinand divided up his kingdom between his 3 sons, Sancho, Alfonso, and Garcia, and his two daughters, Elvira and Urraca. By giving them his dominion, he wanted them to abide by the split in the kingdom and respect his wishes. However, Sancho (born 1030), being the oldest, believed that he deserved more of the kingdom, and therefore sought to gain possession of the divided parts of the kingdom that had been given to his brothers and sisters. Elvira of Castille (born 1038) married Garcia II Aza, the son of Garcia Fernandez Aza 3rd Lord.<br />

Sancho III "The Great" of Navarre (c. 985-October 18, 1035) was Count of Aragon and King of Navarre from 1000 or 1004 until his death, as well as overlord of Castile (from 1029). In his lifetime, he was the most important Christian monarch of Spain. Having gone further than any of his predecessors in uniting the principalities of Spain, his life's work was undone, from a modern point-of-view, when shortly before his deathhe divided his domains to provide for each of his sons.<br />
 <br />
Born to Garćıa the Tremulous of Pamplona and Jimena Fernández, daughter of the Count of Cea (in the Galician frontier), he ascended the throne in 1000 or 1004, inheriting Navarre and Aragon. He later profited from the internal difficulties of Sobrarbe-Ribagorza utilizing his interests and rights as descendant of Dadildis of Le Pailhars and annexed that kingdom in 1016-1019.<br />
 <br />
With his nephew, king Alfonso V of Leon and Count Garćıa Sánchez of Castile, he led a combined attack against Almanzor, conquering further territories in the south. After the crisis in the Caliphate, initiated by the death of Almanzor and leading to fragmented principalities, so-called Taifa kingdoms, Sancho aspired to unify the Christian principalities.<br />
 <br />
However, relation between the three Christian entities soured after the assassination of Count Garćıa of Castile in 1027. He had been bethrothed to Sancha of Leon, with Alfonso V of Leon gaining from Castile lands between river Cea and Pisuerga as his price for approving the pact. As Garcia arrived in Leon for his wedding, he was killed by sons of a noble he had expelled from his lands.<br />
 <br />
Sancho III had opposed the wedding and the ensuing Leonese expansion and got his chance to act after Garcia's death. As the late count's brother-in-law he immediately occupied Castile and was soon engaged in full-scale war with Leonese forces under King Bermudo. The combined Castilean and Navarrese armies quickly overran Bermudo's kingdom, occupying Astorga and even the city of León in 1034. This was the height of Sancho's rule which now extended from the borders of Galicia in the west to the county of Barcelona in the east and he styled himself Rex Hispaniarum, "King of the Spains".<br />
 <br />
Taking residence in Najera instead of the traditional capital of Pamplona, as his realm grew larger, he considered himself a European monarch, establishing relations on the other side of the Pyrenees with the Duchy of Gascony.<br />
 <br />
Issue and succession:<br />
    * Ramiro Sánchez de Aragón, bastard, born of Sancha de Aibar<br />
    * Fernando I "The Great" (1017-1065), king of Castile (1035-1065) and León (1037-1065)<br />
    * Garćıa Sánchez "of Nájera", king in Pamplona<br />
    * Gonzalo Sánchez, king of Sobrarbe and Ribagorza, died 1038.<br />
    * Bernardo Sánchez de Navarra.<br />
 <br />
Sancho was married to Muña Mayor Sánchez, daughter of count Sancho I of Castile. Besides four legitimate sons he also fathered one by his mistress Sancha de Aybar, named Ramiro, who was the eldest of his sons but as bastard not entitled to succeed. Before his death in 1035 Sancho divided his possessions among his sons. Fernando received Castile and the high kingship, Garćıa received Navarre and the Basque country and Gonzalo got Sobrarbe and Ribagorza. The illegitimate son Ramiro obtained the county of Aragon, which was elevated to a kingdom, though very small as it was at that era, hence Ramiro was known as "the petty king".<br />

 <br />
Cerdic of Wessex (c. 467-534), the Patriarch of the Blood Royal of Saxony, was an early King of Wessex (519-534). He is first mentioned in the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle when he landed in Hampshire in 495 and in 519 gained a great victory at Charford, "but Hengest and Adelle's men had touched hardly more than the coast, and the true conquest of Southern Britain was reserved for a fresh band of Saxons, a tribe known as the Gewissas, who landed under Cerdic and his son Cynric on the shores of the Southampton Water, and pushed in 495 to the great Downs of Gwent where Winchester offered so rich a prize. Nowhere was the strife fiercer than here; and it was not till 519 that a decisive victory at Charford ended the struggle for the "Gwent" and set the crown of the West-Saxons on the head of Cerdic." The West Saxons also fought a British king named Natanleod in Wiltshire and slew him. Under his leadership the West Saxons also advanced into Dorset and Somerset. Cerdic was defeated at Mount Badon in Dorsetshire in 520. The conquest of the Isle of Wight is also mentioned among his campaigns, and it was later given to his nephews, Stuf and Wihtgar (who brought many other Saxons with them).<br />
 <br />
In 530 he and his son gradually conquered the country from Sussex to the River Avon in Hampshire; they also passed the Thames and subdued the country as far as Bedford. They were called the West Saxons and the Kingdom of Cerdic was named Wessex. Cerdic died in 534 and was succeeded by his son Cynric.<br />
 <br />
Curiously, the name Cerdic is thought to be British-a form of the name Ceretic-rather than Germanic in origin. One explanation for this is the possibility that Cerdic's mother was British and that he was given a name used by his mother's people; if so, this would provide evidence for a degree of mixing, both cultural and biological, between the invaders and the native British.<br />

Harold Godwinson, or Harold II of England (c. 1022 - October 14, 1066)was the last Anglo-Saxon king of England. He ruled from January 5 toOctober 14, 1066 when he was killed at the Battle of Hastings.<br />
 <br />
Harold's father was Godwin, the powerful Earl of Wessex. Godwin was himself a son to Wulfnoth Cild, Thegn of Sussex and had married twice. First to Thyra Sveinsdóttir (994 - 1018), a daughter of Sweyn I who was King of Denmark, Norway and England. His second wife was Gytha Thorkelsdóttir who was a granddaughter to the legendary Swedish viking Styrbjörn Starke and great-granddaughter to Harold Bluetooth, King of Denmark and Norway, father of Sweyn I. This second marriage resulted in the birth of two sons Harold and Tostig Godwinson, and a sister Edith of Wessex (1020 - 1075) who was Queen consort of Edward the Confessor.<br />
 <br />
Created Earl of East Anglia in 1045, Harold accompanied Godwin into exile in 1051 but helped him to regain his position a year later. When Godwin died in 1053, Harold succeeded him as Earl of Wessex (a province at that time covering the southernmost third of England). This made him the second most powerful figure in England after the king.<br />
 <br />
In 1058 Harold also became Earl of Hereford, and he replaced his late father as the focus of opposition to growing Norman influence in England under the restored Saxon monarchy (1042 - 1066) of Edward the Confessor, who had spent more than a quarter of a century in exile in Normandy.<br />
 <br />
He gained glory in a series of campaigns (1062 - 1063) against the ruler of Gwynedd, Gruffydd ap Llywelyn, who had conquered all of Wales; this conflict ended with Gruffydd's defeat (and death at the hands of his own troops) in 1063. About 1064, Harold married Edith, daughter of the Earl of Mercia, and former wife of Gruffydd ap Llywelyn. By Harold, Edith had two sons - possibly twins - named Harold and Ulf, both of whom survived into adulthood and probably ended their lives in exile. Harold also had several illegitimate children by his famous mistress (or wife, according to Danish law), "Ealdgyth Swan-neck" or "Edith Swan-neck" or "Edith Swanneck".<br />
 <br />
In 1065 Harold supported Northumbrian rebels against his brother Tostig who replaced him with Morcar. This strengthened his acceptability as Edward's successor, but fatally divided his own family, driving Tostig into alliance with King Harald Hardrada ("Hard Reign") of Norway.<br />
 <br />
Upon Edward the Confessor's death in (January 5, 1066), Harold claimed that Edward had promised him the crown on his deathbed, and made the Witenagemot (the assembly of the kingdom's leading notables) approve him for coronation as king, which took place the following day.<br />
 <br />
However, the country was invaded, by both Harald of Norway and William, Duke of Normandy, who claimed that he had been promised the English crown by both Edward (probably in 1052) and Harold, who had been shipwrecked in Ponthieu, Normandy in 1064 or 1065. It was alleged that, on the latter occasion, William forced Harold to swear to support his claim to the throne, only revealing after the event that the box on which he had made his oath contained holy relics. After Harold's death, Normans were quick to point out that in accepting the crown of England, Harold had perjured himself of this oath.<br />
 <br />
Invading what is now Yorkshire in September, 1066, Harald Hardrada and Tostig defeated the English earls Edwin of Mercia and Morcar of Northumbria at the Battle of Fulford near York (September 20), but were in turn defeated and slain by Harold's army five days later at the Battle of Stamford Bridge (September 25).<br />
 <br />
Harold now forced his army to march 240 miles to intercept William, who had landed perhaps 7000 men in Sussex, southern England three days later on September 28. Harold established his army in hastily built earthworks near Hastings. The two armies clashed near Hastings on October 14, where after a hard fight Harold was killed and his forces routed. According to tradition, and as depicted in the Bayeux Tapestry, Harold was killed by an arrow in the eye. Whether he did, indeed, die in this manner (a death associated in the middle ages with perjurers), or was killed by the sword, will never be known. Harold's wife, Edith Swanneck, was called to identify the body, which she did by some private mark (the face being destroyed) known only to herself. Although one Norman account claims that Harold's body was buried in a grave overlooking the Saxon shore, it is more likely that he was buried in his church of Waltham Holy Cross in Essex.<br />
 <br />
Harold's illegitimate daughter Gytha of Wessex married Vladimir Monomakh Grand Duke (Velikii Kniaz) of Kievan Rus' and is ancestor to dynasties of Galicia, Smolensk and Yaroslavl, whose scions include Modest Mussorgsky and Peter Kropotkin. Consequently the Russian Orthodox Church recently recognised Harold as a martyr with October 14 as his feast day.<br />
 <br />
A cult of hero worship rose around Harold and by the 12th century legend says that Harold had indeed survived the battle, had spent two years in Winchester after the battle recovering from his wounds, and then traveled to Germany where he spent years wandering as a pilgrim. As an old man he returned to England and lived as a hermit in a cave near Dover. As he lay dying, he confessed that although he went by the name of Christian, he had been born Harold Godwineson. Various versions of this story persisted throughout the Middle Ages, and have little claim to fact.<br />

From Wikipedia<br />
 <br />
Godwin (sometimes Godwine) (c.1001 - April 15, 1053), was one of the most powerful lords in England under the Danish king Canute the Great and his successors. Canute made him the first Earl of Wessex. Godwin was the father of Harold II and of Edith of Wessex, wife of Edward the Confessor.<br />
 <br />
Biography<br />
Godwin was a seventh generation descendant of King Ethelred of Wessex, the elder brother of Alfred the Great. His descendants were passed over in the royal succession, but became prominent nobles in the kingdom. Godwin's father was Wulfnoth Cild (c.983-1015) who was Thegn of Sussex. Wulfnoth led a section of the royal fleet into piracy and as a consequence had his lands forfeited, and was exiled. It was left to his young son, Godwin, to improve the family fortunes after his father's death in 1014.<br />
 <br />
Godwin was a major supporter of Edmund Ironside, the son of King Aethelred the Unready. While Edmund was in rebellion against his father, Canute and his army invaded England. Edmund was killed, along with many of his supporters, but Godwin survived and pledged his loyalty to Canute. He became one of Canute's advisors, and accompanied him to Denmark to suppress a rebellion there. In 1022 he married Thyra Sveinsdóttir, Canute's sister. She died soon afterwards, but Godwin continued to gain prestige and in 1023 he was the most powerful earl in England.<br />
 <br />
Godwin married again to another Danish noblewoman, Gytha Thorkelsdóttir, granddaughter of the legendary Viking Styrbjörn Starke and great-granddaughter to Harold Bluetooth. The marriage resulted in the birth of many children:<br />
   1. Sweyn Godwinson, Earl of Mercia (c. 1025-1052). At some point he declared himself an illegitimate son of Canute the Great but this is considered to be a false claim.<br />
   2. Harold II of England (c. 1025-October 14, 1066)<br />
   3. Tostig Godwinson, Earl of Northumbria (c. 1026-September 25, 1066).<br />
   4. Edith of Wessex, (c. 1030-December 19, 1075), queen consort of Edward the Confessor<br />
   5. Gyrth Godwinson (c. 1030-October 14, 1066)<br />
   6. Gunhilda of Wessex, a nun (c. 1035-1080)<br />
   7. Ælfgifu of Wessex (c.1035)<br />
   8. Leofwine Godwinson, Earl of Kent (c. 1035-October 14, 1066)<br />
   9. Wulfnoth Godwinson (c.1040)<br />
 <br />
On November 12, 1035, Canute died. His kingdoms were divided among three rival rulers. Harold Harefoot, illegitimate son by Aelgifu of Northampton, usurped the throne of England. Harthacanute, legitimate son by Emma of Normandy, reigned in Denmark. Norway rebelled under Magnus the Noble. On 1037, the throne of England was reportedly claimed by Alfred of Wessex, son of Emma of Normandy and Ethelred the Unready and half-brother of Harthacanute. Godwin is reported to have either captured Alfred himself or to have deceived him by pretending to be his ally and then surrendering him to the forces of Harold Harefoot. Either way Alfred was blinded and soon died.<br />
 <br />
On March 17, 1040, Harold Harefoot died and Godwin supported the accession of Harthacanute to the throne of England. When Harthacanute himself died (June 8, 1042), Godwin supported the claim of his half-brother Edward the Confessor to the throne. Edward was another son of Emma and Ethelred, having spent most of the previous thirty years in Normandy. His reign restored the native royal house of Wessex to the throne of England. Despite his alleged responsibility for the death of Edward's brother Alfred, Godwin secured the marriage of his daughter Edith (Eadgyth) to Edward in 1045. Godwin soon became the leader of opposition to growing Norman influence as Edward drew advisors, nobles and priests from his former place of refuge.<br />
 <br />
Exiled from the kingdom in September 1051 for refusing to punish the people of Dover for a violent clash with the visiting Eustace II, Count of Boulogne, Godwin returned the following year with an armed force, compelling Edward to restore his earldom.<br />
 <br />
On April 15, 1053, Godwin died. His son Harold succeeded him as Earl of Wessex, an area then covering roughly the southernmost third of England. Harold later succeeded Edward the Confessor and became King of England in his own right.<br />

Gytha of Wessex was one of several daughters of Ealdgyth Swanneck byHarold II, the last Anglo-Saxon king of England.<br />
 <br />
According to Saxo Grammaticus, two of Harold's sons and a daughter escaped to the court of their uncle, king Sweyn Estridsson of Denmark. They were treated by Swein with hospitality, while their sister was married to Waldemar, king of Ruthenia. This could be no other prince than Vladimir Monomakh, one of the greatest rulers of Kievan Rus.<br />
 <br />
Gytha was the mother of Mstislav the Great, the last ruler of united Kievan Rus. In the Norse sagas, Mstislav is called Harald after his grandfather. The pateric of St Pantaleon Cloister in Cologne says that "Gytha the Queen" died as a nun on the 10th of March. It is assumed that she followed Godfrey of Bouillon in the first Crusade and died in Palestine, most likely in 1098, as a year later Vladimir Monomakh married another woman.<br />

Gyda Torkelsdotter was the daughter of Torkel Styrbjörnsson. Consequentlyshe was the granddaughter of the disinherited Swedish prince StyrbjörnStarke, the conqueror of Jomsborg, and Tyra, the daughter of HaroldBluetooth king of Norway and Denmark.<br />
 <br />
In 1019, she married the Anglo-Saxon nobleman Godwin of Wessex. Among their children were Harold II of England and Tostig Godwinson, who later faced each other at the Battle of Stamford Bridge.<br />

Bor(ivoj I was Duke of Bohemia (852/853 - 888/889).<br />
 <br />
The head of the Premyslid Czechs who dominated the environs of Prague, Bor(ivoj in c. 870 declared himself kńıe (later translated by German scholars as 'Duke') of the Czechs (Bohemians). Bor(ivoj was recognised as such by his overlord Svyatopluk of Great Moravia around 872 who dispatched Bishop Methodius to begin the conversion of the Czechs to Christianity. Bor(ivoj and his wife Saint Ludmila were baptised by Methodius in 874 and the latter especially became an enthusiastic evangelist, although the religion failed to take root among Bor(ivoj's subjects.<br />
 <br />
Around 883 Bor(ivoj was deposed by a revolt in support of his kinsman Strojmir, and restored only with the support of Svyatopluk of Moravia.<br />
 <br />
As with most of the early Bohemian rulers, Bor(ivoj is a shadowy figure and exact dates and facts for his reign can never be considered as completely reliable, although several major fortifications and religious foundations are said to have dated from this time. In old Czech legends he is said to be son of a prince of Bohemians called Hostiv́ıt.<br />

Vladimir Monomakh (Russian Christian name Vasiliy, or Basil) (1053 -- May19, 1125) was undoubtedly the best loved prince of Kievan Rus. He was theson of Vsevolod I by an anonymous daughter of Emperor Constantine IXMonomachos, from whom he takes his nickname of Monomakh ("One who fightsalone").<br />
 <br />
In his famous Instruction to his own children, Monomakh mentions that he conducted 83 military campaigns and 19 times made peace with the Polovtsi. At first he waged war against the steppe jointly with his cousin Oleg of Chernigov, but after Vladimir was sent by his father to rule Chernigov and Oleg made peace with the Polovtsi to retake that city from him, they parted company. Since that time, Vladimir and Oleg were bitter enemies who would often engage in internecine wars. The enmity continued among their children and more distant posterity.<br />
 <br />
From 1094, his chief patrimony was the Southern town of Pereyaslav, although he also controlled Rostov, Suzdal, and other Northern provinces. In these lands he founded several towns, notably his namesake, Vladimir, the future capital of Russia. In order to unite Russian princes in their struggle against the Great Steppe, Vladimir initiated three princely congresses, the most important being held at Lyubech in 1097 and Dolobsk in 1103.<br />
 <br />
When Sviatopolk II died in 1113, the Kievan populace revolted and summoned Vladimir to the capital. The same year he entered Kiev to the great delight of crowd and reigned there until his death in 1125. As may be seen from his Instruction, he promulgated a number of reforms in order to allay the social tensions in the capital. These years saw the last flowering of Kievan Rus, which was torn apart 10 years after his death.<br />
 <br />
Vladimir was married three times: firstly to Gytha of Wessex, then to a Byzantine noblewoman and finally to a daughter of Kypchak khan. By his first marriage he had Mstislav, his illustrious heir. Among the children by second wife were Yury Dolgoruky, the founder of Moscow, and two daughters: Eufemia who married King Coloman of Hungary and Maria, married to the Byzantine pretender who called himself Leon Diogenes. Vladimir's only sister Praxedis is notorious for her divorce with Emperor Henry IV on the ground that he had attempted a black mass on her naked body.<br />
 <br />
Vladimir Monomakh is buried in the Saint Sophia Cathedral in Kiev. Succeeding generations often referred to his reign as the golden age of that city. Numerous legends are connected with Monomakh's name, including the transfer from Constantinople to Rus of such precious relics as Our Lady of Vladimir and the Muscovite crown called Monomakh's Cap.<br />

Vratislav had two sons, Václav and Boleslav. The Chronicle of Fulda reports that in 900 the Bavarians attacked Moravia in alliance with the Bohemians. Vratislav died (possibly in 919, although 921 is more often conjectured) in battle against the Magyars.<br />

He ruled until he became very old. Then he fell in love with a beautiful girl, Alvsol of Vendsyssel, but was not allowed to marry her. Sigurd attacked Alvsol's brothers, but was mortally wounded during the battle. Alvsol had already died of poison so as not to be taken by Sigurd.<br />
 <br />
Sigurd had the girl and her brothers put on a ship which he steered out to the sea as the ship burnt.<br />
 <br />
He was the father of Ragnar Lodbrok.<br />

Boleslav (or Boleslaus) I the Cruel (? - 972), was the Duke of Bohemia from 929 or 935 to July 15, 972.<br />
 <br />
His father was Vratislav I of Bohemia, Duke of Bohemia. Boleslav I had a son named Boleslav II the Pious of Bohemia, Duke of Bohemia, and a daughter named Dobrava/Dubrawka of Bohemia.<br />
 <br />
Boleslav is notorious for the murder of his brother St. Wenceslas, the result of which brought him to the Czech (ducal) throne. Nevertheless Boleslav is generally respected by Czech historians as an energetic ruler. Citing Wenceslas' religious policies as the cause of Boleslav's fratricide seems unlikely as Boleslav in no way impeded the growth of Christianity in Bohemia, and in fact he actually sent his sister Mlada (a nun) to Rome to ask permission to make Prague a bishopric.<br />
 <br />
One major policy shift after the death of Wenceslas was regarding Czech-German relations. It is usually asserted that Wenceslas was an obedient client of the German King Henry the Fowler. Boleslav on the other hand, found himself almost immediately at war with Henry's successor Otto I the Great. This conflict, presumably consisting of border raids between Boleslav on one side and the Margrave of the Ostmark on the other (the general pattern of warfare in this region at the time) reached its conclusion in 950 when Boleslav signed a peace with Otto. It cannot be said for certain if Boleslav became a vassal of the German King, but it is known that he led a Czech force in alliance with Otto at the great victory over the Magyars at the Lech river (August 10, 955). He had also helped Otto to crush an uprising of Slavs on the Lower Elbe in 953.<br />
 <br />
Czech historians also claim that Boleslav expanded his power into Silesia, Lusatia and Moravia, but no dates are given for these alleged conquests. If they did occur, they must have been only transistory gains because Boleslav's successors had to conquer them all over again. Boleslav realised the growth of Polish strength to the north of his borders and he accordingly arranged for his sister Dobrava to marry the Piast prince Mieszko I in 965.<br />

Randvér or Randver was according to Sögubrot and the Lay of Hyndla, the son of Radbart the king of Gardariki and Aud the daughter of Ivar Vidfamne. In these two sources Aud had Randver's brother Harald Hildetand in a previous marriage.<br />
 <br />
According to Hervarar saga both Randver and Harald Hildetand and were the sons of Valdar and Alfhild, the daughter of Ivar Vidfamne. This saga relates that Ivar appointed Valdar the king of Denmark, and when Valdar died, he was succeeded by Randver. When his brother Harald, had reclaimed Götaland (or Gotland depending on the manuscript), Randver died hastily in England, and was succeeded by Sigurd Ring as the king of Denmark (probably as Harald's viceroy).<br />
 <br />
He was married to Ingild, the daughter of an unknown Swedish king. He was succeeded by his son Sigurd Ring.<br />

About her Book: Argosy<br />
"A book, an easy chair, and I can sail vast seas" The above line of poetry indicates the breadth of vision in this book of poems written by Beulah Windle Scallin and published after her death in 1938. In this book appears most of the poems she wrote throughout her life. The beauty of many of her poems is that there are lines that linger in memory. Among them is Remembrance, whose first and last lines are, "I keep no days for fast and mourning lay.....Memorial Day, for me, is every day." In nearly all her poems there is a line to remember. In Struggle the last line stands out, "Who would know life, attends a rugged school." Mrs. Scallin's poems will live in South Dakota literature for their depth of sympathy and their keen understanding of humanity. From A Tribute we read in the last line "To study glories of the past, and still not scorn the present --Progress and forward gaze."<br />

Sweyn I "Forkbeard" (Svein Otto Haraldsson; Danish: Svend Tveskæg, originally Tjugeskæg or Tyvskæg, Norwegian: Svein Tjugeskjegg) (c. 960 - February 3, 1014). Sveyn I succeeded his father Harold I as king of Denmark, probably in late 986 or early 987. Sweyn had coins made with his likeness, being the first Danish king to do so. The inscription read "Zven, Rex ad Dener".<br />
 <br />
Adam of Bremen, who is strongly anti-Sweyn, claims that Sweyn Forkbeard was deposed by king Eric the Victorious of Sweden, who ruled Denmark "for fourteen years". However, Eric died in 994 and would thus have had to conquer Denmark around 980, long before Sweyn became king and at a time when his father Harold was the king of Denmark, so the long time of Eric's rule may be wrong.<br />
 <br />
Following the battle of Swold in the year 1000, and the death of Norway's king Olaf I, Sweyn established Danish control over a part of Norway, with Eirik Håkonsson Earl as his vassal. The year of his birth is unknown, but he had almost certainly been born when his father accepted Christianity, probably around 960, and he (Sweyn) was given the Christian name Otto after the German emperor. After participating in a Norwegian-led raid against England in 994-995, Sweyn embarked on a series of full-scale invasions (1003-1005, 1006-1007, 1009-1012 and 1013) following the St. Brice's Day massacre of England's Danish inhabitants (November 1002). In 1013 the king himself led the Danish fleet in a full-scale invasion, and the Danes landed at Sandwich and turned towards London. But the Londoners are said to have destroyed the bridges that spanned the river Thames ("London Bridge is falling down"), and Sweyn suffered heavy losses and had to withdraw. He then led his army far into the old Danelaw territory north of Humber and the inhabitants hailed him as their king with barely a drop of blood spilled along the way. One by one, the northern kingdoms fell to Sweyn Forkbeard, and then the southern kingdoms followed suit, until London was alone, isolated within a country which had completely surrendered. Sweyn Forkbeard was finally accepted as the King of England following the flight to Normandy of king Ethelred the Unready in late 1013.<br />
 <br />
Sweyn died at Gainsborough in Lincolnshire, having ruled England unopposed for only five weeks, and his body was returned to Denmark. He was succeeded as King of Denmark by his elder son, Harold II; the Danish fleet proclaimed his younger son Canute the Great as King of England, but they and he returned to Denmark, with Ethelred being restored. Later, Canute ruled in Denmark, England, Norway and some parts of northern Germany.<br />
 <br />
Sweyn Forkbeard's nickname, which was probably used during his lifetime, refers to a long, pitchfork-like moustache, a "tjuge" in Old Norse, not to a full beard. Such a moustache was fashionable at the time, particularly in England.<br />

"The Great Migration Begins", in its entry on William Allen (migrated in1624), states on page 32 & 35 that William was probably brother of RobertAllen, of Salem, Manchester, and New Londond, CT. Undoubtedly this is theRobert Allen/Allyn referred to by TGMB. TGMB states that many sourceshave William born in Manchester, Lancashire in England, but that this isa mistaken association with his residence in Manchester, MA. SinceWilliam came over with the Dorchester Company, he was probably fromDorchester in England. The same origin in England would apply to Robert,his brother.<br />

 <br />
Robert came to America in 1632 going first to Salem, MA where he was admitted to the Church. His brother William had come with him to the New World and they settled in a part of Salem which later became the town of Manchester. He was Constable in 1648 and sworn freeman in 1649. In 1651 he and other members of Manchester and Gloucester emigrated to Pequot (now New London) CT. In 1653, lots were laid out and Robert moved to these quarters in 1656. In 1658, Robert and John Gager were released from their fine for not attending ordinary town training, probably because they lived at such a distance from the center. He was still young enough for military training, this was not usually granted to men under 60. The country in the rear of these hardy pioneers was desolate and wild in the extreme. It was here that the Indian reservation Mashantucket was laid out.<br />
 <br />
Robert Allyn and John Gager were so far removed from the town lots as to scarcely be able to take part in its concerns, or share in its privileges, but they appeared, however to still attend the Sabbath meetings, probably coming down the river in canoes. Robert became an original proprietor in Norwich CT and was Constable in 1669. He was in the deeds of Norwich until 1674 when he removed with his family back to "Allyn's Point:, his home about a mile above Gale's Ferry, the Headquarters of the Yale racing crews on the Thames River. Robert conveyed lands to his son John in 1681.<br />
Children probably born in Salem, MA.<br />

Robert Allyn was in Salem, Massachusetts by 1636. He became a member of the church in 1642 and two of his children, John and Sarah, were baptized a few days later. I think Sarah, at least, must have been born a few years earlier. He moved to Norwich, Connecticut, sometime before 1662, when he was dismissed from the Salem church to the Norwich church. According to Founders and Patriots - Founders of Early American Families, he was in Manchester (formerly Jeffrey's Creek) in 1648, New London in 1651, Norwich in 1660 and back to New London. He was granted land on September 6, 1676, by the town of New London.<br />
 <br />
His death occurred sometime before 20 Sept. 1683. His heirs executed a deed on that date saying that they agreed that Thomas Rose should have the property given to him by their father. It appears he only had one son who survived to adulthood. He had at least three daughters and it may be that Thomas Rose was married to another daughter.<br />

Robert Allyn, the first of that name in this country, was probably born in Manchester, England about 1608. He is known to have lived in Salem. Massachusetts, in 1636, and was admitted to the church there in 1642. He was a proprietor at Jeffery's Creek (now Manchester, Mass.) in 1638 and a constable there in 1648.<br />
 <br />
In March, 1651, he emigrated with the Gloucester Company to New London, Connecticut with Rev. Blinman, and was allotted land on Cape Ann Lane. He later, in 1656, obtained a large tract of land on the east bank of the Thames, then called the Pequod river, at a place still called Allyn's Point (about 4 miles above New London on the east side of the river.) This was then in the town of New London but by changes in boundaries it soon became the town of Ledyard. He was one of a company which purchased land in Norwich or "New Norridge" where he was a constable in 1669. He died in 1683 in Ledyard leaving five children by his wife Sarah--a son John, and four daughters--Sarah, wife of George Geer; Mary, wife of Thomas Park; Hannah, wife of Thomas Rose; Deborah, who afterwards married John Gager Jr.<br />
 <br />
The farm where Robert Allyn settled and established a trading post is still known as 'Allyn's Point' on the<br />
Thames River, and was still owned and occupied by the Allyn family of the ninth generation.<br />

According to the Norse sagas, Sigrid the Haughty was the daughter of the powerful Swedish Viking Skoglar Toste. She married Eric the Victorious, the king of Sweden, and together they had the son Olof Skötkonung. She divorced from Eric and was given Götaland as a fief. After Eric's death, she married Sweyn Forkbeard, the king of Denmark.<br />
 <br />
Prior to this marriage, Olaf Trygvasson, the king of Norway had proposed to her, but she was offended by him when he demanded that she convert to Christianity.

She was successful when Olaf fell against Sweden and Denmark in the naval Battle of Swold, in the year 1000.<br />

Contemporary chroniclers<br />
However, a theory holds that she was the daughter of a mythical Burislav (possibly Mieszko I of Poland and Dubrawka). The medieval chroniclers seem to support the hypothesis that her father was Mieszko I.<br />
 <br />
Medieval chroniclers who mention that mother of Canute was either Slavic or Polish:<br />
    * Thietmar mentioned that the daughter of Mieszko I of Poland and sister of Boleslaw I of Poland married Sweyn I of Denmark and gave him two sons, Canute the Great and Harold II of Denmark, but he did not mention her name. He is probably the best informed from all medieval chroniclers, since he was contemporary to described events and well-informed about the events in Poland and Denmark.<br />
    * Adam of Bremen mentioned that a Polish princess was the wife of Eric the Victorious and that she was the mother of Canute the Great and Harold II of Denmark. Adam's informations here are sometimes considered dubious.<br />
    * "Cnutonis regis" mentioned in one short passage that Canute and his brother went to the land of the Slavs, and brought back their mother, who lived there. This does not necessarily mean that his mother was Slavic, but nevertheless it's strong suggestion that she was.<br />
    * There is an inscription in "Liber vitae of the New Minster and Hyde Abbey Winchester", that king Canute's sister name was "Santslaue" ("Santslaue soror CNVTI regis nostri"), which without doubt is Slavic name. J. Steenstrup suggested, that Canute's sister may have been named after her mother, hence coining (now generally agreed upon) hypothesis, that her Slavic name is Swietoslawa, but only as a reconstruction based on a single mention of her daughter's name and the hypothesis that she named her daughter after herself. This is also in favour of theory that Sigrid was daughter of Mieszko I.<br />
 <br />
Moreover, fact that Canute mother was Boleslaw sister may explain some mysterious facts which appear sometimes in medieval chronicles, as the mentioning of Polish troops in invasions of England.<br />

Few among the Conqueror's companions of arms were so splendidly rewardedas Gilbert de Gant, who held one hundred and seventy-two English manors;yet there is much doubt - or at least much difference of opinion - as towho he really was. Dugdale, and after him Sir Henry Ellis and others,have called him a younger son of Baldwin, Earl of Flanders, andconsequently the nephew of Queen Matilda; but his opinion appears to benow altogether exploded. Mr. Freeman discards it as 'an amazing piece ofgenealogy,' and promptly dubs him 'a Flemish adventurer,' withoutstooping to explain how or whay it was that a mere soldier of fortunereceived so vast a grant of territory. On the other hand, the author of'The Norman People' furnishes him with a lineage more consonant with hisfortunes, tracing his direct descent from Witikind, the renowned opponentof Charlemagne in the eight century. 'When, after many years ofresistance, Witikind was compelled to submit, c 780, he was invested withthe Dukedom of Angria (L'Art de Verifier les Dates, xvi 145). Ludolphus,one of his descendants, was Duke of Saxony, and died in 864, leaving byhis wife (a daughter of Eberhard, Duke of Friuli), Bruno Duke of Saxony.He married a daughter of the Emperor Arnold, and declined the Imperialthrone. Bruno had two sons, 1. Henry the Fowler, Emperor in 919, fatherof the Emperor Otho, who succeeded 936, 2. Wickman. Wickman was createdCount of Gand 940, by the Emperor Otho, his nephew, and had two sons: 1.Theodoric, Count of Gand, ancestor of the Counts of Gand and Guisnes; 2.Adalbert, father of Ralph, father of Baldwin de Gand, Count of Gand orAlos, ancestor of the Counts of Alost, whose younger brother, Gilbert deGand, became Baron of Folkingham in England.' Gilbert was, if not thenephew, the cousin of Queen Matilda; and could claim our great KingAlfred as one of his ancestors. 'He was sixth in male descent fromWickman, Count of the Castle of Gand,' who had married Leutgarde,granddaughter of Elfthryth, Countess of Flanders, the daughter ofAlfred.' - A.S. Ellis.<br />
 <br />
Gilbert, among his other possessions, received the broad lands of Ulf the Constable, lying chiefly in the counties of Nottingham and Lincoln, and chose his predecessor's capital manor, Folkingham, near Grantham, as the head of his barony.<br />
 <br />
The first mention of him is in 1068, when the Conqueror, after the surrender of the city of York placed it under the joint command of William Malet, Robert FitzGilbert, and Gilbert de Gand; and he an Malet were still in charge when, in the following year, the Danes landed in England, besieged and captured the city, and put the garrison to the sword. Only Malet, with his wife and two children, Gilbert and a few others, were spared for ransom or exchange. He died during the reign of Rufus, and was buried in Bardney Abbey, which he had re-founded and re-endowed about 1086-89. It had lain in ruins for more than three centuries, having been destroyed by the Danes under Ingmacr and Hubba.<br />
 <br />
'He had by Alice his wife, daughter of Hugh de Montfort, Lord of Monfort-sur-Risle, and eventually heiress of her brother, 1. Gilbert de Gand, who died without issue in his lifetime; 2, Hugh, who inheriting the extensive fief of his mother's family in Normandy, took the name of Montfort, and was ancestor of the lords of that place and Coquainvilliers. He married Adeline, sister of Waleran, Count of Mellan, and being soon after drawn with him into the revolt in Normandy in favour of William Clito in 1123, was taken prisoner, and Ordericus, writing apparently in 1135, says 'he has now groaned in fetters for thirteen years;' 3, Walter de Gand, ancestor of the Earls of Lincoln; 4, Robert de Gand, most probably another son, Provost of Beverley under the celebrated Thomas a Beckett, Dean of York, and Chancellor to King Stephen; 5, Ralph de Gand, perhaps another son, besieged the castle of Montfort-sur-Risle by Henry I in 1123; and three daughters at least: 1, Emma, married to Alan de Percy; 2, Agnes? wife of William FitzNigel, Constable of Chester to Earl Hugh; and 3, ? married to Ivo de Grentemesnil (Ord. Vit. VIII. xvi).' - A.S. Ellis [Battle Abbey Roll III:307-308]<br />
 <br />
 <br />
Who were the parents of Gilbert de Gant?<br />
compiled by Raymond W. Phair<br />
 <br />
His parents very probably were Ralph, lord of Alost (Aalst in Flemish), and Gisele, daughter of Frederick count of Luxembourg.<br />
 <br />
Sherman has given the most recent detailed account which is the basis for what is summarized below, unless another reference is stated. All the records cited by Sherman have been published. He emphasized the evidence was very strong, but not conclusive.<br />
 <br />
Gilbert I de Gant (d. ca.1095) was in England by 1069 when he and William Malet unsuccessfully defended York castle against the Danish invasion and local rebellion [Sherman; EYC 2:432; CP 6:672n; P. Dalton, Conquest, anarchy and lordship, 1994, p.11].<br />
 <br />
A 1075 transaction in the Watten abbey chronicle was witnessed by Gilbert, described as having come from England and as the brother of Baldwin of Ghent. In 1052 Ralph of Ghent and his son Baldwin attested a charter of the abbey of Saint Peter of Mount Blandin, Ghent (Gand, Gent), presumably the same Baldwin. Their records are the main source of information for this family.<br />
 <br />
Ralph the Advocate was one of the advocates of Saint Peter from as early as 1026 to sometime before 1058. He was succeeded by Baldwin the Advocate. They are believed to be Gilbert's father and brother mentioned in the previous paragraph. It is from their service as advocates that some members of their family were called 'de Gandavo' (of Ghent). Sherman proposed the castellans of Ghent were the other family of advocates of Saint Peter. He also noted that while Gilbert's family were the lords of what was probably the county of Alost, they were never titled counts in any records.<br />
 <br />
In a 1094 gift to the abbey of Bergues St. Winnoc, witnessed by Baldwin of Ghent (son of Gilbert's brother Baldwin who d. 1082), Ralph the Chamberlain identified himself as a son of Ralph of Alost and Gisele. He was a fellow witness with Gilbert to the 1075 transaction mentioned above. He may have been the Ralph son of Ralph in a 1056 charter of Saint Peter, prior to his appointment as chamberlain. Alternatively, the 1056 Ralph son of Ralph might have been Gilbert's father, but he appeared to have been dead in that year, or someone unrelated.<br />
 <br />
The annals of Saint Peter record about 1042 a gift from Ralph of Ghent and his wife Gisele -- their earliest joint appearance. They had at least 3 sons: Baldwin (their heir), Ralph the Chamberlain, and Gilbert. It is thus extremely probable that she was the unidentified Gisele in 1056 and 1058 who gave land and a serf to the abbey for the souls of her father, her husband Ralph, and her sons. Both of her gifts were witnessed by Baldwin, Ralph, and Gilbert, described as her sons. Although they were not called 'of Alost' or 'of Ghent', it would be an extraordinary coincidence if these were not the members of that family.<br />
 <br />
Rubincam, using a source not used by Sherman (and published after Vanderkindere), found that in 1036 Ralph of Ghent and his wife Gisele made a gift to the abbey. Neither Rubincam nor Sherman provided sufficient details to determine if this was the gift Sherman reported occurred in 1042. Rubincam also found, but didn't cite a source, that Ralph in 1056 witnessed a gift by count Baldwin to the abbey of St. Omer. Rubincam believed he was Gilbert's father, but he was probably the brother.<br />
 <br />
Assuming this was Gilbert de Gant in the 1056 gift and that he was about 16 or older, then he was born about 1040 or earlier. His brother Baldwin was probably the Baldwin of Ghent who witnessed a Saint Peter charter in 1046, suggesting he was born about 1030 or earlier.<br />
 <br />
Also, if that was a grant by Gilbert's mother, then his father Ralph had apparently died sometime between 1052 (his last occurrence) and 1056. His parentage is unknown, but it seems likely that he was a descendant of the Ralph the Advocate who appeared in the abbey's records in 994.<br />
 <br />
Vanderkindere (1:121) mentioned a Baldwin appeared as advocate in 962 (not discussed by Sherman) who may thus be another ancestor of Ralph. Moriarty assumed Baldwin was the father of the earlier Ralph who was in turn the father of Ralph husband of Gisele. In view of the large gaps, however, there may have been additional generations.<br />
 <br />
Gilbert's mother was probably the Gisele who was a sister of Otgiva (Ogive), wife of Baldwin IV count of Flanders, and thus Gilbert was one of Charlemagne's descendants. The burials of both Otgiva (d. 21 Feb 1030) and Gisele (d. 21 May, year unknown) are mentioned in the annals of Saint Peter, but it, unfortunately, did not name Gisele's husband.<br />
 <br />
Europaische Stammtafeln (ES), 6:128 (1978), identified Gisele as a daughter of count Frederick and wife of Ralph of Alost, but didn't show their children on that page. It also showed her sister Otgiva married about 1005 Baldwin IV. ES 2:5 (1984) had 1012 for Otgiva's marriage date, as did K.F. Werner's 'Die Nachkommen Karls des Grossen', in Karl der Grosse, ed. W. Braunfels, vol.4 (1967).<br />
 <br />
Sherman wondered if the erroneous ancestry for Gilbert given in Monasticon Anglicanum (5:491) may have arisen when the unknown author, writing after 1307, found in an unknown source that Gilbert was described as 'nepos' of William the Conqueror and assumed it to mean 'nephew', although in this case its less frequent meaning of 'kinsman' was intended. Gilbert was the first cousin once removed of William's wife, if the assumption about Gisele's identity is correct.<br />
 <br />
Gilbert's name appears to have come from his mother's family -- her older brother was Gilbert count of Luxembourg (1047-59), and she had a paternal uncle also named Gilbert. He had a son named Ralph and a grandson named Baldwin, while his brother Baldwin of Ghent named one of his sons Gilbert [CP 7:672; Sherman].<br />
 <br />
Sherman didn't mention if any tenants of Gilbert de Gant in England can be traced to Flanders. Gilbert did not seem to hold any land in Flanders.<br />
 <br />
The identification of Gilbert's father as Ralph of Alost first appeared in A. Duchesne, Histoire genealogique des maisons ... de Gand, ..., 1631. Among the many later writers who have given it were the following:<br />
* L.V.J.A. Vanderkindere, Histoire de la formation territoriale des principautes belges au moyen age, vol.1 (1899).<br />
* W. Farrer, Early Yorkshire Charters (EYC), 2:432 (1915).<br />
* Complete Peerage (CP), 7:672n (1929).<br />
* M. Rubincam, 'The true origin of the house of Gaunt', Genealogists' magazine, 9:1-7 (1940).<br />
* F.M. Stenton, Anglo-Saxon England, 1st ed., 1941, p.621; 3rd ed., 1971, p.629 (no source). D.C. Douglas, William the Conqueror, 1964, p.267, only cited Stenton for it.<br />
* G.A. Moriarty, 'The ancestry of Gilbert de Gant', The American Genealogist, 34:39-40 (1958).<br />
* R.M. Sherman, 'The continental origins of the Ghent family of Lincolnshire', Nottingham Medieval Studies, 22:23-35 (1978).<br />
 <br />
Sherman did not use Farrer, Rubincam, nor Moriarty. See his paper for references to additional works discussing this family.<br />

Note: Jim Weber does not agree with the above parentage for Gilbert.<br />

 <br />
More Important NOTE: Ancestral Roots, in a revised lineage for the 7th edition, states that Gilbert's parents are Gisele (or Gisla) of Luxembourg and Rudolph I of Aalst (or Alost) (also called Ralph de Gand or Ghent). Whoever AR had as parents of Gilbert in prior editions had been removed based on new evidence. The parentage will go with AR.<br />

Gilbert de Gant (Gaunt or Ghent), d. c 1095, buried Bardney, probably arrived in England in 1066; was a commander in York 1068, and was taken prisoner there by the Danes in 1069. He was a tenant-in-chief and one of the largest landholders in co. Lincoln in 1086. Folkingham being the head of his barony; m. Alice de Montfort, daughter of Count Hugh de Montfort-sur-Risle.

From Wikipedia<br />
 <br />
Sancho Garces (c. 860s - December 11, 925) was King of Pamplona 905-925.<br />
 <br />
He was a son of Garcia Jimenez, who was Regent of Pamplona 870-880 and apparently co-king of Pamplona from 860 up to 882. Sancho may also have been a co-king during the reign of Fortun I of Pamplona.<br />
 <br />
The elderly Sancho succeeded King Fortun Garces when the latter was deposed by his enemies in 905.<br />
 <br />
Sancho's first wife Urraca, daughter of count of Aragon, did not have surviving children. Thus, Sancho's heirs were his children from his second marriage with queen Toda Aznarez and were born in his last decade of life, when he was an old man. Their minority led to special arrangements in the succession.<br />
 <br />
Queen Toda Aznarez (Teuda of Larraun) was a daughter of Aznar Sanchez, lord of Larraun, cadet of the Aritza line of kings of Pamplona, and of his wife Oneca Fortunez who herself was a daughter of Fortun Garces. Thus, Toda's children also descended from the first kings of Pamplona, the Iniguez line.<br />
 <br />
Sancho I Garces fought against the Moors with repeated success and joined Ultra-Puertos, or Basse-Navarre, to his own dominions, also extending its territory as far as Najera. As a thank-offering for his victories, he founded, in 924, the convent of Albelda. Before his death, all Moors had been driven from the country.<br />
 <br />
King Sancho Garces was succeeded by his brother Jimeno, but his young son Garcia Sanchez also received the royal title, and after Jimeno's death in 931, the young Garcia became the sole king.<br />

From Wikipedia<br />
 <br />
Alexius III Angelus, Byzantine emperor, was the second son of Andronicus Angelus, nephew of Alexius I.<br />
 <br />
In 1195, while his brother Isaac II was away hunting in Thrace, he was proclaimed emperor by the troops; he captured Isaac at Stagira in Macedonia, put out his eyes, and kept him henceforth a close prisoner, though he had been redeemed by him from captivity at Antioch and loaded with honours.<br />
 <br />
To compensate for this crime and to confirm his position as emperor, he had to scatter money so lavishly as to empty his treasury, and to allow such licence to the officers of the army as to leave the Empire practically defenceless. He consummated the financial ruin of the state. The able and forceful empress Euphrosyne tried in vain to sustain his credit and his court; Vatatzes, the favourite instrument of her attempts at reform, was assassinated by the emperor's orders.<br />
 <br />
Eastward the Empire was overrun by the Seljuk Turks; from the north Bulgarians and Vlachs descended unchecked to ravage the plains of Macedonia and Thrace; while Alexius squandered the public treasure on his palaces and gardens. Soon he was threatened by a new and yet more formidable danger. In 1202 the Western princes of the Fourth Crusade assembled at Venice, bent on a new crusade. Alexius, son of the deposed Isaac, escaped from Constantinople and appealed to the crusaders, promising as a crowning bribe to heal the schism of East and West if they would help him to depose his uncle.<br />
 <br />
The crusaders, whose objective had been Egypt, were persuaded to set their course for Constantinople, before which they appeared in June 1203, proclaiming Alexius as emperor Alexius IV and summoning the capital to depose his uncle. Alexius III, sunk in debauchery, took no efficient measures to resist. His son-in-law, Lascaris, who was the only one to do anything, was defeated at Scutari, and the siege of Constantinople began. On the July 17 the crusaders, the aged doge Enrico Dandolo at their head, scaled the walls and took the city by storm. During the fighting and carnage that followed Alexius hid in the palace, and finally, with one of his daughters, Irene, and such treasures as he could collect, got into a boat and escaped to Develton in Thrace, leaving his wife, his other daughters and his Empire to the victors. Isaac, drawn from his prison and robed once more in the imperial purple, received his son in state.<br />
 <br />
Shortly afterwards Alexius made an effort in conjunction with Murtzuphlos (Alexius V) to recover the throne. The attempt was unsuccessful and, after wandering about Greece, he surrendered with Euphrosyne, who had meanwhile joined him, to Boniface of Montferrat, then master of a great part of the Balkan peninsula (the so-called Kingdom of Thessalonica). Leaving his protection he sought shelter with Michael, despot of Epirus, and then repaired to Asia Minor, where his son-in-law Lascaris was holding his own against the Latins.<br />
 <br />
Alexius, joined by Kay Khusrau I, the sultan of Rüm (also called the sultan of Iconium or Konya), now demanded the crown of Lascaris, and on his refusal marched against him. Lascaris, however, defeated and took him prisoner. Alexius was relegated to a monastery at Nicaea, where he died on some date unknown.<br />

Worcester Telegram & Gazette, 18 January 1997<br />
------------------------------------<br />
Vernon was born in Greendale (a part of Worcester) where my father worked for Young Brother's Ladder Co. When he was a baby he was allergic to milk, and was therefore sickly, skinny and fretful. Gram Boynton said that when she came to help my mother, she would say to her, "You hold the baby and I'll do the housework." She was afraid he might die in her arms.<br />
My father said that when he was attempting to teach Vern the alphabet the child would not say the letter "a." Dad would say, "Say "a" Vernon." Vern would say "b, c, d." Dad would then say, "Say "a" Vernon." Then Vern would burst into tears and say, "I can't say "a"."<br />
Around this time it is said that Vern sawed his rocking horse (two horses with a seat between them) in half because he wanted to ride bare-back.<br />
He was ill so much that my mother held him a great deal. When baby Wenona would cry, he would slide down her lap and say, "Feed her." (All of us were breast-fed.) Then he would go and stand in the corner and cry, saying, "I cry all the time, all the time, all the time."<br />

Andronicus I Comnenus (c.1118-1185), Byzantine emperor, son of princeIsaac Comnenus, and grandson of Alexius I Comnenus, was born about thebeginning of the 12th century. His birth has been estimated to c. 1118.He was endowed by nature with the most remarkable gifts both of mind andbody. He was handsome and eloquent, but licentious; and at the same timeactive, hardy, courageous, a great general and an able politician.<br />
 <br />
Andronicus' early years were spent in alternate pleasure and military service. In 1141 he was taken captive by the Seljuk Turks and remained in their hands for a year. On being ransomed he went to Constantinople, where was held the court of his cousin, the emperor Manuel, with whom he was a great favourite. Here the charms of his niece, the princess Eudoxia, attracted him. She became his mistress, while her sister Theodora stood in a similar relation to the emperor Manuel.<br />
 <br />
In 1152, accompanied by Eudoxia, he set out for an important command in Cilicia. Failing in his principal enterprise, an attack upon Mopsuestia, he returned, but was again appointed to the command of a province. This second post he seems also to have left after a short interval, for he appeared again in Constantinople, and narrowly escaped death at the hands of the brothers of Eudoxia.<br />
 <br />
About this time (1153) a conspiracy against the emperor, in which Andronicus participated, was discovered and he was thrown into prison. There he remained for about twelve years, during which time he made repeated but unsuccessful attempts to escape. At last, in 1165, he was successful; and, after passing through many dangers, reached the court of Yaroslav, grand prince of Ruthenia, at Kyiv. While under the protection of the grand prince, Andronicus brought about an alliance between him and the emperor Manuel, and so restored himself to the emperor's favour. With a Russian army he joined Manuel in the invasion of Hungary and assisted at the siege of Semlin.<br />
 <br />
After a successful campaign Manuel and Andronicus returned together to Constantinople (1168); but a year after, Andronicus refused to take the oath of allegiance to the prince of Hungary, whom Manuel desired to become his successor. He was removed from court, but received the province of Cilicia.<br />
 <br />
Being still under the displeasure of the emperor, Andronicus fled to the court of Raymond, prince of Antioch. While residing here he captivated and seduced the beautiful daughter of the prince, Philippa, sister of the empress Maria. The anger of the emperor was again roused by this dishonour, and Andronicus was compelled to flee.<br />
 <br />
He took refuge with Amalric I of Jerusalem, whose favour he gained, and who invested him with the Lordship of Beirut. In Jerusalem he saw Theodora, the beautiful widow of the late King Baldwin III and niece of the emperor Manuel. Although Andronicus was at that time fifty-six years old, age had not diminished his charms, and Theodora became the next victim of his artful seduction. To avoid the vengeance of the Emperor, she fled with Andronicus to the court of the Sultan of Damascus; but not deeming themselves safe there, they continued their perilous journey through Persia and Turkestan, round the Caspian Sea and across Mount Caucasus, until at length they settled in the ancestral lands of the Comneni at Oinaion, on the shores of the Black Sea, between Trebizond and Sinope.<br />
 <br />
While Andronicus was on one of his incursions, his castle was surprised by the governor of Trebizond, and Theodora with her two children were captured and sent to Constantinople. To obtain their release Andronicus made abject submission to the Emperor and, appearing in chains before him, implored pardon. This he obtained, and was allowed to retire with Theodora into banishment at Oinaion.<br />
 <br />
In 1180 the emperor Manuel died, and was succeeded by his son Alexius II Comnenus, who was under the guardianship of the empress Maria. Her conduct excited popular indignation, and the consequent disorders, amounting almost to civil war, gave an opportunity to the ambition of Andronicus. He left his retirement, secured the support of the army and marched upon Constantinople, where his advent was stained by a cruel massacre of the Latin inhabitants, which was focused on the Venetian merchants who virtually controlled the economy of the city. Alexius was compelled to acknowledge him as colleague in the empire, but was soon put to death.<br />
 <br />
Andronicus, now (1183) sole emperor, married Agnes of France, widow of Alexius II and a child twelve years of age. Agnes was a daughter of Louis VII of France and his third wife Adèle of Champagne.<br />
 <br />
His short reign was characterized by strong and wise measures. He resolved to suppress many abuses, but, above all things, to check feudalism and limit the power of the nobles. The people, who felt the severity of his laws, at the same time acknowledged their justice, and found themselves protected from the rapacity of their superiors. The aristocrats, however, were infuriated against him, and summoned to their aid William II of Sicily. This prince landed in Epirus with a strong force, and marched as far as Thessalonica, which he took and destroyed; but he was shortly afterwards defeated, and compelled to return to Sicily.<br />
 <br />
Andronicus seems then to have resolved to exterminate the aristocracy, and his plans were nearly crowned with success. But in 1185, during his absence from the capital, his lieutenant ordered the arrest and execution of Isaac Angelus, a descendant of the first Alexius. Isaac escaped and took refuge in the church of Hagia Sophia. He appealed to the populace, and a tumult arose which spread rapidly over the whole city. When Andronicus arrived he found that his power was overthrown, and that Isaac had been proclaimed emperor. Isaac delivered him over to his enemies, and for three days he was exposed to their fury and resentment. At last they hung him up by the feet between two pillars. His dying agonies were shortened by an Italian soldier, who mercifully plunged a sword into his body. He died on September 12, 1185. Andronicus was the last of the Comneni to rule Constantinople, althugh his grandsons Alexius I of Trebizond and his brother David founded the Empire of Trebizond in 1204.<br />

Empress Euphrosyne (died ca. 1210) was the wife of Alexius III Angeluswho secured the election of her husband to the throne by wholesalebribery. She virtually took the government into her hands, workingthrough the minister Vatatzes and temporarily restored the waninginfluence of the monarchy over the nobles. Her reputation for profligateextravagance undercut the dynasty's popularity, however, in spite of hertalent for government. In the sack of Constantinople in 1203 by thecrusaders she was abandoned by her husband but joined him in exile anddied in Epirus.<br />

Steven Joseph Eberts was born March 1, 1922, in Qu'appelle, Saskatchewan.He attended Kindred School near Holdfast until he was nine years old andlater went to Goldridge School south of Duke and attended until Grade 8.<br />
He entered the armed forces on October 28, 1942 and served during World War II until December 1945, and returned home. His training began in Regina and Dundurn. He then traveled to England and Scotland and completed three more months of training. After thirteen days on the ocean, he landed in Sicily. Steve says that the Germans shot the engine out of the train he was on, and his troop had to set up camp in a vineyard. They were low on provisions so they ended up eating a lot of grapes (no indoor plumbing).<br />
Steve's years in the service allowed him to travel to many places in the World. He went on to Marseilles, France and was even involved with the liberation of Holland (to this day the people of Holland are grateful).<br />
In the spring of 1947, Steve was groomsmen for brother John's wedding, where he met a lovely bridesmaid and sister of John's wife, Sis. He was smitten and on May 3, 1948 he married Dorothy Ackerman.<br />
Steve and Dorothy farmed near Dilke, Saskatchewan for two years, and then they bought a farm near Lumsden. They lived on the farm until 1962, and then built a home in the Town of Lumsden to raise their growing family. Steve and Dorothy continued to farm until 1980. Steve was affectionately known as the "suitcase farmer" because he drove back and forth to the farm for many years. In fact, "suitcase fanner" became his 'handle' on the CB radio.<br />

GLENULLIN- John "Johnny" J. Kalvoda Jr. died peacefully Dec. 22, 2005, atMarian Manor Healthcare Center, Glen Ullin, of complications frommultiple sclerosis, a disease he battled more than half of his life.Services will be held 2:30 p.m. Tuesday, Dec. 27, at Christ the KingCatholic Church, Mandan, with the Rev. Albert Leary officiating. Burialwill follow in Mandan Union Cemetery.<br />
Visitation will be held from 1 to 9 p.m. Monday at Weigel Funeral Home, Mandan, with rosaries by Christian Mothers at 4:30 p.m. and the Knights of Columbus at 7:30 p.m., with a parish vigil at 8 p.m.. Visitation will continue one hour prior to services at the church.<br />
Johnny ("Yenda" in Czech) was born March 6, 1933, in Mandan, the son of John Sr. and Marie (Kadlec) Kalvoda. He married Lila Lee Lowman on June 26, 1963, in Bismarck, and the couple raised their family in Mandan. In 1965, he was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis, a disease that slowly reduced his ability to walk. A born farmer, he also sold real estate until 1976. His condition forced him to completely retire in 1978. By 1999, medical realities mandated a move to Marian Manor Healthcare Center, where his good-natured ribbing made him a staff favorite.<br />
He loved the land and its animals, quietly bursting with pride to help something grow, be it endless fields of wheat, the lilacs that lined his family's backyard, or the family dog, Spencer. A force of nature in younger days, Johnny was a competitive ringleader who loved to dance, hunt (including aerial), collect pens, "watch a good Western or war picture," and rollerskate (once flying out an open window). He even worked in a stock car pit crew. Friends would attend wrestling matches at the Bismarck Civic Center just to see Johnny sit in the corner and taunt the "dirty" guy. Cards and board games brought out a hilarious sore winner side, and sometimes he would "bend the rules" by speaking in Czech. He loved to share laughs about the good old days until he fell out of his chair, tears streaming down his face.<br />
But as the multiple sclerosis progressed, family and friends attempted to ease the struggle, and the later years were hard.<br />
Johnny is survived and was blessed by his wife of 42 years, Lila Lee, Mandan; son, Charlie, Round Lake, Ill.; son, Andy "Drew" and daughter-in-law, Anja, Moorhead, Minn.; daughter, Theresa, and son-in-law, Mike Porter, Bismarck; son, Mike, Los Angeles; six grandsons, Ethan and Jayden Porter, and Jacob, Jonathon, Jordan and Joseph Kalvoda; one sister and brother-in-law, Marie and Eugene Graner Sr., Bismarck; one brother and sister-in-law, E.C. (Milo) and Lois, Mandan; and a treasure of family and friends whom he thought the world of.<br />
He was preceded in death by his parents; his brother, Benedict; and his infant sister, Libby.<br />
In lieu of flowers, the family prefers memorials to the Multiple Sclerosis Society, Marian Manor Healthcare Center, and the Humane Society.<br />

Olof Björnsson (ca 970 - 975), was a semi-legendary Swedish king, who according to Hervarar saga and the Styrbjarnar áttr Sv́ıakappa ruled together with his brother Eric the Victorious. He was the father of Styrbjörn Starke, and he died of poison during a meal. Instead of proclaiming his son Styrbjörn co-ruler, Eric proclaimed his own unborn child co-ruler on condition that it was a son. It was a son who became Olof of Sweden.<br />

Styrbjörn the Strong (Styrbjörn Sterki) or Styrbjörn the Swedish Champion (Styrbjörn sv́ıa kappi) was according to the Norse sagas the son of Olof (II) Björnsson, and the nephew of Eric the Victorious. At his father's death, ca 980, Björn could claim greater right to the throne of Sweden than Eric's own soon to be born son.<br />
 <br />
The earliest attestation of Styrbjörn is from a contemporary scaldic poem a lausav́ısa[1] 1. It is believed that there once was a larger saga on Styrbjörn, but most of what is extant is found in the short story Styrbjarnar áttr Sv́ıakappa. Parts of his story are also retold in Eyrbyggja saga and in Hervarar saga. He is moreover mentioned in Yngvars saga v́ıđförla where Ingvar the Far-Travelled is compared to his kinsman Styrbjörn.<br />
 <br />
The following synopsis is based on Styrbjarnar áttr Sv́ıakappa:<br />
 <br />
Youth<br />
Styrbjörn was unusually big, strong and unruly (for a Viking) and although he was only a little boy he managed to kill a courtier who accidentally had hit him on the nose with a drinking horn.<br />
 <br />
When he was 12 years old he asked his uncle for his birthright, but when he was denied the co-rulership of Sweden he sulked for a long time on his father's mound.<br />
 <br />
When he was 16 the Ting decided that he was too unruly to be king of Sweden. Eric decided to make his own unborn child co-regent on the condition that it was a son. As a compensation his uncle Eric gave him 60 well-equipped longships whereupon the frustrated Styrbjörn took his sister Gyrid and left.<br />
 <br />
Career<br />
He ravaged the shores of the Baltic Sea and when he was twenty, he conquered the stronghold of Jomsborg from its founder Palnetoke, and became the ruler of the Jomsvikings.<br />
 <br />
After some time he allied with the Danish king Harold Bluetooth and married his sister Gyrid to him. Styrbjörn married Harold's daughter Tyra, whom he was given by Harold for conquering Jomsborg. (Styrbjörn had the son Torkel Styrbjörnsson with Tyra. Torkel had a daughter named Gytha Thorkelsdóttir, who married Godwin, Earl of Wessex and became the mother of Harold II of England).<br />
 <br />
The Battle of the Fyris Wolds<br />
Harold gave him even more warriors and now Styrbjörn was about to reclaim the throne of Sweden. He sailed with a huge force which included 200 Danish longships in addition to his own Jomsvikings. When they arrived at Föret (Old Norse: Fyris) in Uplandia he burnt the ships in order to force his men to fight to the end. The Danish force changed its mind and returned to Denmark.<br />
 <br />
Styrbjörn marched alone with his Jomsvikings to Gamla Uppsala. His uncle was, however, prepared and had sent for reinforcements in all directions.<br />
 <br />
During the first two days, the battle was even. In the evening, Eric went to the statue of Odin at the Temple at Uppsala where he sacrificed. He promised Odin that if he won the battle, he would belong to Odin and arrive at Valhalla in ten years from then.<br />
 <br />
The third day, Eric threw his spear over the enemy and said "I sacrifice you all to Odin". The Swedes were winning, and the Danish warriors fled. Only Styrbjörn and his sworn men stayed, and died.<br />

 <br />
Raynald of Châtillon (also Reynald or Reginald of Chastillon) (c.1125-July 4, 1187) was a knight who served in the Second Crusade and remained in the Holy Land after its defeat. There he ruled as Prince of Antioch from 1153 to 1160.<br />
 <br />
He was a younger son of Henry, lord of Châtillon, from the middle-ranking noble family of Champagne that had produced Eudes of Châtillon, Pope Urban II. Raynald had joined the Second Crusade in 1147 to seek his fortune. He entered the service of Constance of Antioch, whose first husband had died in 1149. She married Raynald in secret in 1153, without consulting her liege lord, Baldwin III of Jerusalem. Neither King Baldwin nor Aimery of Limoges, the Latin Patriarch of Antioch, approved of Constance's choice of a husband of such lower birth.<br />
 <br />
One of Raynald's first acts in Antioch was an assault on the Latin Patriarch; he had the Patriarch seized, stripped naked, covered in honey, and left to suffer in the burning sun. When the Patriarch was released, he collapsed in exhaustion and agreed to finance Raynald's expedition against Cyprus. Raynald's forces attacked Cyprus, ravaging the island, and raping and pillaging the inhabitants. Cyprus was a possession of the Byzantine Empire, and in 1159 Raynald was forced to pay homage to Byzantine emperor Manuel I Comnenus as punishment for his attack, promising to accept a Greek Patriarch in Antioch. When Manuel came to Antioch later that year to meet with Baldwin III, King of Jerusalem, Raynald was forced to lead Manuel's horse into the city.<br />
 <br />
Soon after this, in 1160, Raynald was captured by the Muslims during a plundering raid against the Syrian and Armenian peasants of the neighbourhood of Marash. He was confined at Aleppo for the next seventeen years. He was ransomed for the extraordinary sum of 120,000 gold dinars in 1176, emerging from his long captivity more bloodthirsty and ambitious than ever. Because his wife Constance had died in 1163, Raynald married another wealthy widow, Stephanie, the widow of both Humphrey III of Toron and Miles of Plancy, and the heiress of the lordship of Oultrejordain, including the castles Kerak and Montreal to the southeast of the Dead Sea. These fortresses controlled the trade routes between Egypt and Damascus and gave Raynald access to the Red Sea. He became notorious for his wanton cruelty at Kerak, often having his enemies and hostages flung from the walls of castle to be dashed to pieces on the rocks below.<br />
 <br />
In November 1177, at the head of the army of the kingdom, he defeated Saladin at the Battle of Montgisard; Saladin narrowly escaped. In 1181 the temptation of the caravans which passed by Kerak proved too strong, and, in spite of a truce between Saladin and Baldwin IV, Raynald began to plunder. Saladin demanded reparations from Baldwin IV, but Baldwin could only reply that he was unable to coerce his unruly vassal. The result was a new outbreak of war between Saladin and the Latin kingdom in 1182. In the course of the hostilities Raynald launched ships on the Red Sea, partly for piracy, but partly as a threat against Mecca and Medina, challenging Islam in its own holy places. His pirates ravaged villages up and down the Red Sea, before being captured by the army of Al-Adil I only a few miles from Medina. Although Raynald's pirates were taken to Cairo and beheaded, Raynald himself escaped to the Moab. Saladin vowed to behead Raynald himself, and at the end of the year Saladin attacked Kerak, during the marriage of Raynald's stepson Humphrey IV of Toron to Isabella of Jerusalem. The siege was raised by Count Raymond III of Tripoli, and Reynald was quiet until 1186.<br />
 <br />
That year he allied with Sibylla and Guy of Lusignan against Count Raymond, and his influence contributed to the recognition of Guy as king of Jerusalem, although Raymond was the better candidate. Later in 1186 Raynald attacked a caravan in which Saladin's sister was travelling, breaking the truce between Saladin and the Crusaders. King Guy chastised Raynald in an attempt to appease Saladin, but Raynald replied that he was lord of his own lands and that he had made no peace with Saladin. Saladin swore that Raynald would be executed if he was ever taken prisoner.<br />
 <br />
In 1187 Saladin invaded the kingdom, defeating the Crusaders at the Battle of Hattin. The battle left Saladin with many prisoners. Most prominent among these prisoners were Reynald and King Guy, both of whom Saladin ordered brought to his tent. According to al-Safadi in al-Wafi bi'l-wafayat, Saladin offered water to Guy, who then gave the glass to Raynald. Saladin knocked the water away, saying that he had not offered water to Raynald and thus was not bound by the Muslim rules of hospitality. After being rebuked by Saladin for his treachery, Raynald was executed, either beheaded by Saladin himself or killed by one of Saladin's men in the presence of his companions. King Guy, however, was spared. Saladin explained that one king did not kill another and that Raynald had only been executed because of his great crimes. Guy was taken to Damascus for a time, then allowed to go free.<br />
 <br />
Many of the Crusaders considered Raynald a martyr, although all evidence shows him to have been a plunderer and a pirate who had little concern for the welfare of the Kingdom. The successes of the Kingdom were almost singlehandedly undone by Raynald's recklessness and selfishness.<br />
 <br />
Raynald and Constance had two daughters: Agnes, who married king Bela III of Hungary; and Alix, who married Azzo V d'Este.<br />

Wiglaf (died 839/40) was the King of Mercia from 827 to 829 and againfrom 830 until his death. His rule coincided with the rise of the rivalAnglo-Saxon kingdom of Wessex under Egbert.<br />
 <br />
Wiglaf does not seem to have been a member of the traditional Mercian royal line, and it is unclear whether he had any relationship to it. He became king after his predecessor, Ludeca, was killed in a failed attempt to subjugate the rebellious East Anglians. At this time, Mercia was engaged in a conflict with the rising power of Wessex, which had begun during the reign of Beornwulf in 825, and in 829, Egbert of Wessex successfully invaded Mercia and drove Wiglaf from his throne.<br />
 <br />
Historically speaking, this event marked the beginning of the domination of England by Wessex, but the Mercians regained their independence and brought Wiglaf back to power in the following year. It is unclear whether this was the result of a Mercian rebellion against West Saxon rule or a grant made by Egbert to a submissive Wiglaf; the 20th century historian Frank Stenton argued in his Anglo-Saxon History that the former is more likely, and cited a charter of 836 as evidence that Wiglaf was acting as an independent ruler at that time.<br />

Gorm the Old (Gorm den Gamle) was King of Denmark in the mid-900s.<br />
 <br />
The son of Danish king Harthaknut, Gorm is one of the most misinterpreted figures in Danish history. Often maligned as a cruel old dotard and a staunch heathen, Gorm was probably born around 910-915, and died in late 958 according to dendrochronological studies of the wood in his burial chamber.<br />
 <br />
His ancenstry may lie with the Danish rulers in East Anglia, one of which was named Guthrum, a form of the name Gorm. His father came to Denmark around 916 or 917 and deposed the young king Sigtrygg, and when Harthaknut died, Gorm ascended to the throne. Claims that he took it by force, or that he only ruled part of the peninsula of Jutland are almost certainly erroneous...Gorm's great-great-grandson king Sweyn Estridsson referred to both Gorm and his father as kings of (all of) Denmark, not just parts of the country.<br />
 <br />
Gorm was neither old nor unwise; when correctly interpreted, early sources point to him as being open-minded and pragmatic as far as Denmark's relationship with the Christian neighbors to the south was concerned, but earlier historians often confused him with his father who supposedly withstood the coming of Christianity for as long as he lived.<br />
 <br />
His skeleton is believed to have been found at the site of the first Christian church of Jelling. During the reign of Gorm, most Danes still worshipped the Norse gods, but during the reign of Gorm's son Harold Bluetooth, Denmark officially converted to Christianity. Harold supposedly moved the skeleton of his father from its original resting place into the church, but left the hill where Gorm had originally been interred as a memorial.<br />

Mstislav I Vladimirovich the Great  (June 1, 1076 - April 14, 1132), was the Grand Prince of Kiev (1125-1132), the eldest son of Vladimir Monomakh by Gytha of Wessex. He figures prominently in the Norse Sagas under the name Harald, taken to allude to his grandfather, Harold II of England.<br />
St Nicholas Cathedral, built by Mstislav I near his palace at Yaroslav's Court, Novgorod, contains 12th-century frescoes depicting his illustrious family<br />

St Nicholas Cathedral, built by Mstislav I near his palace at Yaroslav's Court, Novgorod, contains 12th-century frescoes depicting his illustrious family<br />
 <br />
As his father's future successor, Mstislav reigned in Novgorod the Great from 1088-93 and (after a brief stint at Rostov) from 1095-1117. Thereafter he was Monomakh's co-ruler in Belgorod-on-the-Dnieper, and inherited the Kievan throne after his death. He built numerous churches in Novgorod, of which St. Nicholas Cathedral (1113) and the cathedral of St Anthony Cloister (1117) survive to the present day. Later, he would also erect important churches in Kiev, notably his family sepulchre at Berestovo and the church of Our Lady at Podil.<br />
 <br />
Mstislav's life was spent in constant warfare with Cumans (1093, 1107, 1111, 1129), Estonians (1111, 1113, 1116, 1130), Lithuanians (1131), and the princedom of Polotsk (1127, 1129). In 1096, he defeated his uncle Oleg of Chernigov on the Koloksha River, thereby laying foundation for the centuries of enmity between his and Oleg's descendants. Mstislav was the last ruler of united Rus, and upon his death, as the chronicler put it, "the land of Rus was torn apart".<br />
 <br />
In 1095, Mstislav wed Princess Christine of Sweden, daughter of King Ingold I. They had many children:<br />
   1. Ingeborg of Kiev, married Canute Lavard of Jutland, and was mother to Valdemar I of Denmark<br />
   2. Malmfrid, married (1) Sigurd I of Norway; (2) Eric II of Denmark<br />
   3. Eupraxia, married Alexius I Comnenus<br />
   4. Vsevolod of Novgorod<br />
   5. Maria, married Vsevolod II of Kiev<br />
   6. Iziaslav II of Kiev<br />
   7. Rostislav of Kiev<br />
   8. Sviatopolk of Pskov<br />
   9. Rogneda, married Yaroslav of Volinya<br />
  10. Xenia, married Briachislav of Izyaslawl<br />
 <br />

Björn Eriksson was the father of Olof (II) Björnsson and Eric the Victorious, according to Hervarar saga. He was the grand-father of Styrbjörn Starke. According to Hervarar Saga he was the son of an Erik who fought Harald Fairhair who succeeded the brothers Björn at Hauge and Anund Uppsale. Erik Anundsson is the only Erik who fits.<br />
 <br />
In the saga of Olaf the Holy, Snorri Sturluson quotes Thorgny Lawspeaker on king Björn:<br />
 <br />
    My father, again, was a long time with King Bjorn, and was well acquainted with his ways and manners. In Bjorn's lifetime his kingdom stood in great power, and no kind of want was felt, and he was gay and sociable with his friends.<br />
 <br />
When Björn died Olof and Eric were elected to be co-rulers of Sweden. Eric would however disinherit his nephew Styrbjörn.<br />
 <br />
Adam of Bremen, however, only gives Emund Eriksson as the predecessor of Eric the Victorious. Since the Swedes seem to have had a system of co-rulership (Diarchy), it is probable that Emund Eriksson was a co-ruler of Björn's.<br />

Constance of Antioch (1127-1163) was the ruler of the principality of Antioch (a crusader state) from 1130 to her death.<br />
 <br />
Constance was the only daughter of Bohemund II of Antioch by his wife Alice, princess of Jerusalem. She became princess of Antioch when she was only four-years-old, under the regency of Baldwin II of Jerusalem (1130-1131) and Fulk of Jerusalem (1131-1136). Her mother Alice did not want the principality to pass to Constance, preferring to rule in her own name. Alice attempted to ally with the Muslim atabeg of Mosul, Zengi, offering to marry Constance to a Muslim prince, but the plan was foiled by Alice's father Baldwin, who exiled her from Antioch. In 1135 Alice attempted once again to take control of the principality, and sought a husband for Constance in Manuel Comnenus, at that time the heir to the Byzantine throne. Fulk exiled her again and re-established the regency for Constance. In 1136, while still a child, Constance was married to Raymond of Poitiers, whom the noble supporters of the regency had secretly summoned from Europe; Alice was tricked into believing Raymond was going to marry her, and, humiliated, left Antioch for good when the marriage was performed. From this union three children were born:<br />
    * Bohemund III of Antioch, who succeeded her in 1163<br />
    * Maria of Antioch (1145-1182), married (rechristened as "Xena") to Manuel I Comnenus<br />
    * Philippa of Antioch, mistress to Andronicus I Comnenus<br />
 <br />
In 1149, Raymond died in the battle of Inab and Constance remarried in 1153 to Raynald of Chatillon, who also became co-ruler of Antioch. Constance had two daughters from Raynald:<br />
    * Agnes (1154-1184), married king Bela III of Hungary<br />
    * Alix, married Azzo V d'Este<br />
 <br />
Raynald was captured in 1160 and spent the next sixteen years in a prison in Aleppo. A dispute arose between Constance and her son, Bohemund, when Bohemund tried to seize power in Antioch. A riot broke out, and Constance was exiled from the city. She died in 1163.<br />

Harthacnut of Denmark:<br />
 <br />
Most Danes know that the official line of Danish kings begins with Gorm the Old, the father of renowned king Harald Bluetooth, who ruled Denmark in the 950s. In reality it ought to start with Harthacnut, his father.<br />
 <br />
In the 890s Denmark was conquered by Swedes and king Helge was deposed by Olaf who founded the House of Olaf in Denmark. According to clergyman Adam of Bremen, who came from Germany to record the history of the archbishops of Bremen and was allowed to "interview" king Sweyn Estridsson, Olav and two or more of his sons took the realm "by weapons and violence". When Olav died, two of his sons seem to have ruled simultaneously, and around 915 a son of Olav's son Gnupa and Danish noblewoman Asfrid became king. This young man, whose name was Sigtrygg, is remembered on two runestones erected by his mother after his death.<br />
 <br />
And this is where Harthacnut enters the picture. Probably born in the 880s, he was the son of an otherwise unknown "Sweyn", and is often described as being the grandson (or adopted grandson) of semi-mythic viking chieftain Sigurd Snake-Eye, one of the sons of the legendary Ragnar Lodbrok. This is however impossible to verify. Adam says that Harthacnut (Danish: Hardeknud) came from "Northmannia", the "land of the Northmen", by which he may mean either Norway or Normandy, which had recently been colonized by Danish vikings. But it is also likely that Harthacnut was brought up in the Danelaw territories in East Anglia.<br />
 <br />
He must have been a full-grown man with a certain reputation when he came (back?) to Denmark around 916, and according to Adam and his star witness king Sweyn, Harthacnut immediately deposed the young king Sigtrygg. This happened "in the last days of archbishop Hoger", says Adam, and Hoger died around 917. Harthacnut then ruled unopposed for approximately thirty years, and while some researchers have used a single somewhat dubious source, the Saxon chronicles of Widukind, to establish that Sigtrygg's father Gnupa was still king in 934 when the Danes had an altercation with German king Heinrich, there can be little doubt that the king who was supposedly forced to pay a tribute to the German ruler was in fact Harthacnut. Claims that king Heinrich I forced the "heathen" Danish king to be baptized are almost certainly erroneous.<br />
 <br />
In 948, the archbishop of Bremen appointed three bishops to Denmark, and that probably signifies a change in government...Harthacnut is usually portrayed as indifferent or hostile towards Christianity, and while that may only be the church's interpretation, it seems likely that a new and more open-minded king had ascended to the throne around 947 or 948.<br />

Olga Kulchisky was born in Smoky Lake on September 12, 1914 on the familyfarm. She was the second oldest child of Harry and Wasylena Kulchisky,who had a family of seven children. Her father, with his brothers, andneighbours built St. Onufry's Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church in 1910.Some years later the family moved into town to take on the ownership andoperation of a general store and telephone exchange office.<br />
Olga attended White Mud country school until grade seven. She then took grade eight at McKay Avenue School in Edmonton, and was promoted to grade nine without having to write the required provincial exams. Olga attended grade nine and ten at Smoky Lake. Her grade 11 she took at a separate high school in Edmonton.<br />
Upon completion of her schooling, Olga worked as a switchboard operator with Alberta Government Telephones in Smoky Lake from 1933 to 1937 with an interim period at the local post office. During her early working years she also participated in Ukrainian dancing and plays.<br />
On July 22, 1937 Olga married Tom Ternoway. After their marriage they continued to farm on the original Ternoway homestead that had been settled in 1902 and which Olga would proudly call home until her passing. Olga and Tom raised a family of two daughters, Shirley and Beatrice.<br />
Olga was very active and devoted to her church - Sts. Volodymyr and Olha Ukrainian Catholic Church. She helped with the upkeep of St. Onufry's Cemetery. She served as president and secretary of the church club and was a choir member for many years. She was extremely proud to be part of the 100 person "Centennial Choir" that performed for two years in celebration of 100 years of Ukrainian Settlement in Canada.<br />
In 1954 she returned to work as a telephone operator and remained at this job until 1967. From 1970 to 1976 she worked as a nursing ward aide at the Smoky Lake Nursing Home as well as running her own catering business for four years.<br />
Olga, along with husband Tom, were founding members of the museum in town. They were charter members of the Smoky Lake Cultural and Heritage Society. She was an active member until her passing. Olga and Tom were a driving force behind Heritage Days, the fund raising functions and the establishment of a museum building to preserve the history and Ukrainian culture of the area.<br />
After working at the nursing home for six years she could see some form of assistance was needed in transporting patients. So Olga set the gears in motion for the community to get a Lions Action Bus. She volunteered her time to raise funds.<br />
She was an active member of the Senior Citizen's Drop-In Centre. She helped with coffee, sold tickets to their functions, and baked for them for years.<br />
Olga enjoyed gardening and travel, bird watching and reading, and spoiling her grandsons, in whose lives she has been an important and special influence. She travelled throughout Canada and the United States. She kept up with her own yard work until her passing. She enjoyed the many birds and animals who lived on or passed through the farm. She also enjoyed doing crosswork, Ukrainian egg painting, and fancy work in her younger years, as well as dressing up for Halloween dances and the Malanka (Ukrainian New Year's). She was proud of her Ukrainian Heritage, and upheld Ukrainian traditions to the very end.<br />

From Wikipedia<br />
 <br />
Roger Mortimer (25 April 1287 - 29 November 1330), grandson of the 1st Baron Wigmore, was the best-known of his name. As a result of his adulterous relationship with Isabella of France, queen of King Edward II of England, he was responsible for deposing (and probably for murdering) King Edward, and himself became effective ruler of England.<br />
 <br />
Early life, family history<br />
Roger was the eldest son and first child born to Edmund Mortimer, 2nd Baron Wigmore, by his wife, Margaret de Fiennes. His father had been a second son, intended for clerical work, but on the sudden death of his elder brother, Edmund was recalled from Oxford University and installed as heir. As a boy, Roger was probably sent to be fostered in the household of his formidable uncle, Roger Mortimer of Chirk. It was this uncle who had carried the head of Llywelyn the Last to King Edward I of England in 1282.<br />
 <br />
Like many noble children of his time, Roger was married young, to Jeanne de Geneville, the heiress of a neighboring lordship. They were married in 1301, and immediately began a family. Through his marriage with Jeanne de Geneville, Roger not only acquired increased possessions on the Welsh marches, including the important Ludlow Castle, which became the chief stronghold of the Mortimers, but also extensive estates and influence in Ireland.<br />
 <br />
Then, suddenly, childhood came to a crashing halt when Edmund Mortimer was mortally wounded in a skirmish near Builth in July 1304. Since Roger was underage at the death of his father, Edmund Mortimer, he was placed by Edward I under the guardianship of Piers Gaveston, and was knighted by Edward in 1306. In that year also Roger was endowed as Baron Wigmore, and came into his full inheritance. His adult life began in earnest.<br />
 <br />
Military adventures in Ireland, Wales<br />
In 1308 he went to Ireland in person, to enforce his authority. This brought him into conflict with the De Lacys, who turned for support to Edward Bruce, brother of Robert Bruce, king of Scotland. Mortimer was appointed lord-lieutenant of Ireland by Edward II. In 1316, at the head of a large army, he drove Bruce to Carrickfergus and the De Lacys into Connaught, wreaking vengeance on their adherents whenever they were to be found.<br />
 <br />
He was then occupied for some years with baronial disputes on the Welsh border until about 1318.<br />
 <br />
Opposition to Edward II<br />
In 1318, Mortimer joined the growing opposition to Edward II and the Despensers, and he supported Humphrey de Bohun, 4th earl of Hereford, in refusing to obey the kingʼs summons to appear before him in 1321.<br />
 <br />
Forced to surrender to the king at Shrewsbury in January 1322, Mortimer was consigned to the Tower of London, but escaped to France in August 1324. In the following year Queen Isabella, wife of Edward II, anxious to escape from her husband, obtained his consent to her going to France to use her influence with her brother, King Charles IV, in favour of peace. At the French court the queen found Roger Mortimer; she became his mistress soon afterwards, and at his instigation refused to return to England so long as the Despensers retained power as the kingʼs favourites.<br />
 <br />
Invasion of England and defeat of Edward II<br />
The scandal of Isabellaʼs relations with Mortimer compelled them both to withdraw from the French court to Flanders, where they obtained assistance for an invasion of England. Landing in England in September 1326, they were joined by Henry Plantagenet, 3rd Earl of Leicester; London rose in support of the queen, and Edward took flight to the west, pursued by Mortimer and Isabella.<br />
 <br />
After wandering helplessly for some weeks in Wales, the king was taken prisoner on 16 November, and was compelled to abdicate in favour of his son. Though the latter was crowned as Edward III on January 25, 1327, the country was ruled by Mortimer and Isabella, who are believed to have arranged the murder of Edward II in the following September at Berkeley Castle.<br />
 <br />
Powers won and lost<br />
Rich estates and offices of profit and power were now heaped on Mortimer, and in September 1328 he was created Earl of March. However, he was no more competent than the Despensers to conduct the government of the country. His own son, Geoffrey, mocked him as "the king of folly". The jealousy and anger of Lancaster had been aroused by Mortimer's rise, and Lancaster prevailed upon the young king, Edward III, to assert his independence. At a parliament held at Nottingham in October 1330 a plot was successfully carried out by which Mortimer was arrested in the castle. In spite of Isabellaʼs entreaty to her son to "Fair son, have pity on the gentle Mortimer," was conveyed to the Tower.<br />
 <br />
Accused of assuming royal power and of various other high misdemeanours, he was condemned without trial and hanged at Tyburn on 29 November, 1330, his vast estates being forfeited to the crown. Mortimer's widow, Jeanne, received a pardon in 1336 and survived till 1356. She was buried beside Mortimer at Wigmore, but the site was later destroyed. They had 12 children together:<br />
   1. Edmund Mortimer (1302-1331)<br />
   2. Margaret Mortimer (1304-1337), married Thomas de Berkeley, 3rd Lord Berkeley<br />
   3. Roger Mortimer (1305-1338)<br />
   4. Maud Mortimer (1307-aft.1345), married John de Charlton, Lord of Powys<br />
   5. Geoffrey Mortimer (1309-1372/1376)<br />
   6. John Mortimer (1310-1328)<br />
   7. Joan Mortimer (1311/1313-1337/1351), married James Audley, 2nd Baron Audley<br />
   8. Isabella Mortimer (1311/1313-aft.1327)<br />
   9. Catherine Mortimer (1311/1313-1369), married Thomas de Beauchamp, 11th Earl of Warwick<br />
  10. Agnes Mortimer (1315/1321-1368), married Lawrence Hastings, 1st Earl of Pembroke<br />
  11. Beatrice Mortimer (1315/1321-1383), married (1) Edward, 2nd Earl of Norfolk; (2) Thomas de Braose, 1st Baron Brewes<br />
  12. Blanche Mortimer (1314/1322-1347), married Piers de Grandison, 2nd Lord Grandison<br />
 <br />
His eldest son, Edmund, was father of another Roger Mortimer, who was restored to his grandfatherʼs title.<br />

Lionel of Antwerp, Duke of Clarence, (November 29, 1338 - October 7,1368) was the second son of Edward III of England and Philippa ofHainault. He was so called because he was born at Antwerp, Belgium.<br />
 <br />
Betrothed when a child to Elizabeth de Burgh, 4th Countess of Ulster (d. 1363), daughter and heiress of William Donn de Burgh, 3rd Earl of Ulster (d. 1332), he was married to her in 1352, but before this date he had entered into possession of her great Irish inheritance. He was called Earl of Ulster from 1347.<br />
 <br />
Having been named as his father's representative in England in 1345 and again in 1346, Lionel joined an expedition into France in 1355, but his chief energies were reserved for the affairs of Ireland.<br />
 <br />
Appointed governor of that country, he landed at Dublin in 1361, and in November of the following year was created Duke of Clarence, while his father made an abortive attempt to secure for him the crown of Scotland. His efforts to secure an effective authority over his Irish lands were only moderately successful; and after holding a parliament at Kilkenny, which passed the celebrated Statute of Kilkenny in 1367, he dropped the task in disgust and returned to England.<br />
 <br />
Lionel's wife died in Dublin in 1363, having given birth to a daughter, Philippa, whose descendants would one day claim the throne for the House of York. A second marriage was arranged for Lionel with Yolande or Violante, daughter of Galeazzo Visconti, lord of Pavia (d. 1378); the enormous dowry which Galeazzo promised with his daughter being exaggerated by the rumour of the time. Journeying to fetch his bride, Lionel was received in great state both in France and Italy, and was married to Violante at Milan in June 1368. Some months were then spent in festivities, during which Lionel was taken ill at Alba, where he died.<br />
 <br />
His only child, Philippa Plantagenet, married in 1368 Edmund Mortimer, 3rd Earl of March (1351-1381). They were parents to Anne de Mortimer, grandparents to Richard Plantagenet, 3rd Duke of York and great-grandparents to Edward IV and Richard III.<br />
 <br />
The poet Geoffrey Chaucer was at one time a page in Lionel's household.<br />

Roger Mortimer, 2nd Earl of March (1328 - February 26, 1360) was anEnglish nobleman and military commander during the Hundred Years War.<br />
 <br />
He was the son of Edmund Mortimer, who was the son of Roger Mortimer, 1st Earl of March. His mother was Elizabeth Badlesmere.<br />
 <br />
The Mortimer family lands and titles were lost after the first earl's revolt and death in 1330, which was followed the next year by the death of Roger's father. Roger thus grew up with uncertain prospects, and was to only gradually re-acquire the family honors.<br />
 <br />
Around 1342, he received back Radnor, and the next year the old family baronial seat at Wigmore.<br />
 <br />
As a young man he distinguished himself in the wars in France, fighting at Crecy and elsewhere in the campaign of 1347. Afterwards he was given livery of the rest of his lands, was one of the original Knights of the Garter, and was summoned to parliament as a baron in 1348.<br />
 <br />
In 1354, the sentence passed against his grandfather the first earl was reversed, and the next year he was summoned to parliament as Earl of March. Also in 1355 he received a number of important appointments, including Constable of Dover Castle and Warden of the Cinque Ports, and accompanied Edward III's expedition to France.<br />
 <br />
Around this time his grandmother, Joan de Genville, widow of the first earl, died, and Roger inherited her large estate, including Ludlow Castle, which was thereafter the Mortimer family seat.<br />
 <br />
In the following years he became a member of the royal council, and was appointed constable at the castles of Montgomery, Bridgnorth, and Corfe.<br />
 <br />
In 1359, and continuing into 1360, he was constable of Edward III's invasion of France, fighting in the failed siege of Reims and capturing Auxerre. The English forces then moved into Burgundy, where Roger died suddenly at Rouvray near Avallon.<br />
 <br />
Roger married Philippa Montacute, daughter of William Montacute, 1st Earl of Salisbury.<br />

Pippin the Hunchback (b. before 770, d. 813) was the first son of Charlesthe Great (Charlemagne) and his first wife (or concubine) Himiltrude.Accounts describe Pippin as normally proportioned with attractivefeatures. However, his looks were marred by a spinal deformity from whichhis nickname is derived.<br />
 <br />
Due to his disability, Pippin was never a strong contender to succeed his father to the Frankish throne. Nevertheless, Charles treated his son well, giving him precedence over his younger brothers as was appropriate for his age. Pippin was an amiable fellow, and he grew to be a well-liked member of Charles' court. The hunchbacked prince probably held some hope for succession from his father. In addition, Pippin was an easy target for discontented nobles, who lavished sympathies on him and lamented the treatment his mother had received when Charles had divorced her in favor of a Lombard princess. Thus, in 780, Charles formally disinherited Pippin and had the pope baptize his third son, Carloman, as Pippin. This move may have been prompted by Charles' third wife and the mother of Carloman, Hildegarde. The hunchbacked prince was a threat to her sons' succession, both due to Charles' doting attitude toward him and his name (Frankish succession had alternated between Charleses and Pippins for the last four generations).<br />
 <br />
Pippin was allowed to remain at court, and Charles continued to give the boy precedence over his younger brothers. Pippin also remained a popular "friend" of discontented nobles, and in 792, several counts played upon Pippin's dislike for his brothers to convince the deformed prince to play the figurehead in their rebellion. The conspirators planned to kill Charles, his wife Hildegarde, and his three sons by her. Pippin the Hunchback would then be set upon the throne as a more sympathetic (and more easily manipulated) king. The day of the assassination, Pippin pretended to be ill in order to meet with the plotters. The scheme nearly succeeded, but a Lombard deacon named Fardulf ultimately exposed it.<br />
 <br />
King Charles held an assembly at Regensburg to try the conspirators, and all were found guilty of high treason and ordered executed. Charles seems still to have held fond feelings for his first son, however, for Pippin's sentence was commuted. Instead, Pippin was forced to enter the monastery of Prüm to live out the rest of his life as a monk. Pippin died there some twenty years later.<br />

MECF MOURNS LOSS OF DEDICATED PROVIDER<br />
Clifton O. Greenwood, a highly respected long term care provider from Westport and a former MECF Board member, died recently at the age of 60. Greenwood began his career in long term care helping his mother run the family business, now known as the Hanover House Retirement facility in Fall River. Recognized as a leader in the profession, Greenwood was responsible for the design and development of the Clifton Rehabilitative Nursing Center in Somerset, a facility focusing on providing residents with an innovative health care environment. Working alongside his children Andrea and Eric, Greenwood later developed the Clifton Outpatient Rehabilitative Clinic and the Inn at Clifton Assisted Living Community, both in Somerset. "Our members mourn the loss of Clifton Greenwood," said Ned Morse, MECF President. "Clifton was a unique individual who was passionate about providing high quality care for the frail elderly and disabled.

Br(etislav (b. between 1005-1012, d. January 10, 1055) of the house ofPremyslids was a duke of Bohemia from 1035 till 1055.<br />
 <br />
Br(etislav was a son of duke Oldr(ich, then the protector of the atecko province, and his would-be wife Boena. In 1019 at Schweinfurt he kidnapped his future wife Judith of Schweinfurt (Jitka), a daughter of a Bavarian margrave, Henry of Schweinfurt of Nordgau.<br />
 <br />
During his fatherʼs reign, in 1029, he took back Moravia from Poland. About 1031 Br(etislav invaded Hungary in order to prevent its expansion under king Stephen. The partition of Bohemia between Oldr(ich and his brother Jaromir in 1034 was probably the reason why Br(etislav fled beyond Bohemian border only to come back to take the throne after Jaromirʼs abdication.<br />
 <br />
In 1035 Br(etislav helped Emperor Conrad II in his war against the Lusatians. In 1038 he invaded Little Poland, captured Krakow and Poznan and sacked the capital, Gniezno, bringing the relics of St Adalbert back with him. On the way back he conquered part of Silesia including Wroc?aw. His main goal was to set up an archbishopric see in Prague and create a large state subject only to the Holy Roman Empire. In 1041 the German King Henry III invaded Bohemia but was forced to retreat by an ambush on his supply lines. However, Br(etislav was aware that he could not hold out indefinitely against the Germans and signed a truce with Henry III. In the ensuing peace treaty Br(etislav renounced all of his conquests save for Moravia.<br />
 <br />
In 1047 Emperor Henry III negotiated a peace treaty between Br(etislav and the Poles. This pact worked in Br(etislav's favour as the Polish ruler swore never again to attack Bohemia in return for an annual subsidy to Gniezno. In 1054 Bretislav issued the famous Seniority Law. For the first time this act stated that Bohemia and Moravia would pass directly through the senior line of the Premyslid dynasty. Younger members of the dynasty were allowed to govern Moravia, but only at the Duke's discretion.<br />
 <br />
Br(etislav was the author of decrees concerning the rules of Christianization, which included a ban on polygamy or trade on holidays.<br />
 <br />
Br(etislav died at Chudrim in 1055 during his preparation for another invasion of Hungary and was succeeded by his son Spytihnev II.<br />

Saint Vladimir Svyatoslavich the Great (c.958-1015) was the grand princeof Kiev who converted to Christianity in 988, and proceeded to baptisethe whole Kievan Rus. His name is known in three traditions: in Old EastSlavic and modern Ukrainian as Volodymyr, in Old Church Slavonic andmodern Russian as Vladimir, and in the Norse and modern Scandinavianlanguages as Valdemar.<br />
 <br />
 <br />
Bloody way to the throne<br />
Vladimir was the youngest son of Svyatoslav I by his slave girl Malusha, described in the Norse sagas as a prophetess who lived to the age of 100 and was brought from her cave to the palace to predict the future. Hagiographic tradition of dubious authenticity connects his childhood with the name of his grandmother, Olga Prekrasa, who was Christian and governed the capital during Svyatoslav's frequent military campaigns.<br />
 <br />
Transferring his capital to Pereyaslavets in 969, Sviatoslav designated Vladimir ruler of Novgorod the Great but gave Kiev to his legitimate son Yaropolk. After Sviatoslav's death (972), a fratricidal war erupted (976) between Yaropolk and his younger brother Oleg, ruler of the Drevlians. In 977 Vladimir fled to his kinsmen in Scandinavia, collecting as many of the Viking warriors as he could to assist him to recover Novgorod, and on his return the next year marched against Yaropolk.<br />
 <br />
On his way to Kiev he sent ambassadors to Rogvolod (Norse: Ragnvald), prince of Polotsk, to sue for the hand of his daughter Rogneda (Norse: Ragnhild). The well-born princess refused to affiance herself to the son of a bondswoman, but Vladimir attacked Polotsk, slew Rogvolod, and took Ragnhild by force. Actually, Polotsk was a key fortress on the way to Kiev, and the capture of Polotsk and Smolensk facilitated the taking of Kiev (980), where he slew Yaropolk by treachery, and was proclaimed konung, or kagan, of all Kievan Rus.<br />
 <br />
Years of pagan rule<br />
In addition to his father's extensive domain, Vladimir continued to expand his territories. In 981 he conquered the Cherven cities, the modern Halychyna; in 983 he subdued the Yatvyags, whose territories lay between Lithuania and Poland; in 985 he led a fleet along the central rivers of Russia to conquer the Bulgarians of the Kama, planting numerous fortresses and colonies on his way.<br />
 <br />
Though Christianity had won many converts since Olga's rule, Vladimir had remained thorough going pagan, taking eight hundred concubines (besides numerous wives) and erecting pagan statues and shrines to gods. It is argued that he attempted to reform Slavic paganism by establishing thunder-god Perun as a supreme deity. It is probable that he instituted the practice of human sacrifices as well.<br />
 <br />
In the year 987, as the result of a consultation with his boyars, Vladimir sent envoys to study the religions of the various neighboring nations whose representatives had been urging him to embrace their respective faiths. The result is amusingly described by the chronicler Nestor. Of the Muslim Bulgarians of the Volga the envoys reported there is no gladness among them; only sorrow and a great stench; their religion is not a good one, as they don't drink wine and eat pork. In the temples of the Germans they saw no beauty; but at Constantinople, where the full festival ritual of the Orthodox Church was set in motion to impress them, they found their ideal: We no longer knew whether we were in heaven or on earth, nor such beauty, and we know not how to tell of it. If Vladimir was impressed by this account of his envoys, he was yet more so by political gains of the Byzantine alliance.<br />
 <br />
In 988, having taken the town of Chersones in Crimea, he negotiated for the hand of the emperor Basil II's sister, Anna. Never had a Greek princess married a Barbarian before, as matrimonial offers of French kings and German emperors had been peremptorily rejected. In short, to marry the 27-year-old princess to a pagan Slav seemed impossible. Vladimir, however, was baptized at Chersones, taking the Christian name of Basil out of compliment to his imperial brother-in-law; the sacrament was followed by his marriage with the Roman princess. Returning to Kiev in triumph, he destroyed pagan monuments and established many churches, starting with the splendid Church of the Tithes (989) and monasteries on Mt. Athos.<br />
 <br />
He now formed a great council out of his boyars, and set his twelve sons over his subject principalities. With his neighbors he lived at peace, the incursions of the savage Pechenegs alone disturbing his tranquillity. After Anna's death, he married again, most likely to a granddaughter of Otto the Great.<br />
 <br />
He died at Berestovo, near Kiev, while on his way to chastise the insolence of his son, Prince Yaroslav of Novgorod. The various parts of his dismembered body were distributed among his numerous sacred foundations and were venerated as relics. One of the largest Kievan cathedrals is dedicated to him. The University of Kiev has rightly been named after the man who both civilized and Christianized Kievan Rus. Eastern Orthodox churches celebrate the feast day of St. Vladimir on 15 July.<br />
 <br />
His memory was also kept alive by innumerable folk ballads and legends, which refer to him as Krasno Solnyshko, that is, the Fair Sun. With him the Varangian period of Eastern Slavic history ceases and the Christian period begins.<br />

His dates are sometimes given in genealogies as birth in 570, the beginning of his reign in 593, and death in either 606 or 615, but with no apparent evidence; the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle just mentions him as father of Penda, with no further detail.<br />

Pybba, who is said by the Historia Brittonum to have had 12 sons, is also said to have been succeeded by Cearl, of unknown relationship. His son Penda eventually became king; the Chronicle gives the date of this as 626, although Bede suggests it was not until after the battle of Hatfield Chase in 633. Besides Penda and Eowa (who the author of the Historia Brittonum said were the sons of Pybba who were the best known to him), Pybba also apparently had a son named Coenwalh. Every king from Penda until Ceolwulf, who was deposed in 823, was said to be a descendant of Pybba, either through Penda, Eowa, or Coenwalh (perhaps excluding the short-lived Beornrad, whose background is unknown).<br />

"While the community of Hatfield was being established on the west bankof the river, the land further west was left to the animals and theIndians.  Alone, that is, until about the year 1735 when a noted hunterand trapper, John Miller of Northampton, erected a log house on a hill inthe eastern portion of the 'Hatfield Woods.'  He purchased a tract of 900acres, bounded on the south by the Northampton line and embracing whatlater became a thriving village.<br />
 <br />
          For seventeen years Mr. Miller hunted and trapped in solitary splendor.  Game was plentiful, with deer, bear, wolves, catamounts, wild turkey, and smaller animals to be had, and the streams were filled with trout.  Indians there were , too, but obviously Mr. Miller was successful in evading their raids.  Then Capt. Samuel Fairfield settled close by and ended Mr. Miller's solitary domination, but this probably was not too onerous since Captain Fairfield was his nephew.  Between 1745 and 1750 a stage road was opened across the region between Northampton and Pittsfield and Captain Fairfield opened a tavern to accommodate travelers over the route.<br />
 <br />
          Further settlement awaited the ending of the French and Indian Wars, when men felt reasonably safe in leaving the protected settlements.  From 1760 to 1771 many homesteads were established on the numerous hills.  Indian raids occurred occasionally, as various wandering bands sought to discourage white men from further expansion.

Guy came to Massachusetts from Nova Scotia about 1925. The depression hadhit Nova Scotia earlier and harder than New England so he sought work. InNova Scotia he had worked on his father's farm as well as working as acooper and lumberjack. He settled in Westborough where others he knewfrom home had settled. He found work as a coal truck driver. In thosedays he had to first load the truck by hand and then offload it by handat people's homes. Later, when oil became the heating fuel of choice, hedrove an oil truck. No doubt it was easier than a coal truck but stillrequired deliveries to be made in all sorts of weather.<br />
He used to tell us that when he decided to go to Massachusetts, he was involved with a young lady. Once he found work, he was to send for her and they would be married. In 1926 he married Irene Evelyn Thorpe whom he had known in Nova Scotia. She was not, however, the girl that he had left waiting. He always chuckled when he said he never knew what happened to her. We suspect his motives for leaving Nova Scotia went beyond looking for work!<br />

Andregoto Gaĺındez was daughter of Count Galindo II Aznárez Count ofAragon from 922, being by his second wife, Sancha Garcés of Pamplona. Sheis frequently referred to as Countess, and made heiress to her father,yet she was not the eldest daughter of her father, and likewise Aragonhad already been absorbed into the Kingdom of Pamplona by Sancho I ofPamplona, years before her marriage to that king's son, Garćıa Sánchez I.Garćıa, who was her first cousin, divorced Andregoto due toconsanguinity, leaving a sole son by her, Sancho II of Pamplona. It hasbeen suggested that Andregoto remarried and had further children,although the details have not been discovered. Endregota, wife of 11thcentury count Sancho Maceratiz, calls herself a descendant of AndregotoGaĺındez, but Ubieto Arteta suggests the later countess descended fromher sister Velasquita Gaĺındez.<br />

Garcia III Sanchez (c. 919-970) was King of Pamplona until 970.<br />
 <br />
He was the son of Sancho Garces and Toda Aznarez. His father was very old at his birth, and died in 925. Garcia's mother took over as his regent and Garcia's uncle Jimeno became king or co-king. Jimeno died in 931, after which the underage Garcia was the sole king.<br />
 <br />
Through his mother, Garcia was a great-grandson of king Fortun Garces who had ceased to reign in 905 when imprisoned by enemies, but lived on until Garcia's own reign as a monk in Leyra.<br />
 <br />
With the support, of his energetic and diplomatic mother, Garcia, like his father, engaged in a number of conflicts with the Moors. He married Andregoto, heiress of Aragon, but divorced her.<br />
 <br />
Garcia was succeeded by his son Sancho II Garces, nicknamed Abarca, who apparently was the first historic King of Navarre or the first to use the style "of Navarre" rather than "of Pamplona".<br />
