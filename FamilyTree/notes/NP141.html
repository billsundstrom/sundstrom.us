Mr. Dempsey had always been in good health until last January, when he suffered an attack of grip and never entirely recovered. The grip was followed by bronchial troubles and general debility. For the past six weeks he had been confined to his bed and his death was not unexpected as the family realized that he could not recover.<br>

After the war, Mr. Dempsey returned to Decatur and was given the position of street commissioner. He served in that office for ten or twelve years and then went into the street paving business, forming a partnership with John Giblin, the firm being known as Dempsey & Giblin. When there was street paving work to be done the firm made contracts but in the past two years Mr. Dempseys health began to fall and he was not able to follow any active business life.<br>
On September 2, 1846, Mr. Demsey married Mary J. Lowry at Chillicothe, Ohio. The widow and five children survive. The latter are Charles C., Andrew G. and H. C. Dempsey, Miss Ella Dempsey and Mrs. John Pealwell, all of Decatur.<br>

George came with his father in the "Lion" 1631; but his first wife dying, he returned to England served with distinction under Cromwell; at Naseby he was severely wounded, taken to the house of John Borrodell,481 nursed by his daughter Ann whom he afterwards married. Again coming to New England he settled near Stonington.<br>
During King Philip's war he was a leader in ten expeditions against the Indians, in one of which he captured Canonchet.<br>
<br>

-----------------------<br>
<br>
He was the son of William and Margaret (Chandler) (Monck) Denison. He married first Bridget Thompson and second Ann Borodell.<br>
<br>
George Denison died in Hartford, Oct. 23, 1694, while there on some special business, being 76 years old. His wife, Ann Borodel1, died Sept. 26, 1712, aged 97 years. They were both remarkable for magnificent personal appearance, and for force of mind and character. She was always called "Lady Ann." They held a foremost place in Stonington. At the time of their marriage, in 1645, she was 30 years old and he 27. He has been described as "the Miles Standish of the settlement," but he was a greater and more brilliant soldier than Miles Standish. He had no equal in any of the colonies, for conducting a war against the Indians, excepting, perhaps, Captain John Mason.<br>
<br>
George's brother, General Daniel Denison wrote in 1672: " My Brother George buried his first Wife in the year 1643, went into England, was a souldier ther above a year, was at the Battle of York or Marston Moor where he did good service, was afterward taken prisoner, but got free, and having married a second Wife, he returned to New England the year before our Mother died, and not long afterward removed himself to New London, near whereunto at Stonington he now liveth."<br>
The story is that George met his second wife, Ann Borodell, when he was wounded and took shelter in her father's house. He married her in England and returned to Massachusetts about 1644. <br>

Hardeknud of DENMARK
<p>
<a name ="I005579"><b>[I005579]</b></a><br />
From Wikipedia<br>
<br>
Harthacnut of Denmark:<br>
<br>
Most Danes know that the official line of Danish kings begins with Gorm the Old, the father of renowned king Harald Bluetooth, who ruled Denmark in the 950s. In reality it ought to start with Harthacnut, his father.<br>
<br>
In the 890s Denmark was conquered by Swedes and king Helge was deposed by Olaf who founded the House of Olaf in Denmark. According to clergyman Adam of Bremen, who came from Germany to record the history of the archbishops of Bremen and was allowed to "interview" king Sweyn Estridsson, Olav and two or more of his sons took the realm "by weapons and violence". When Olav died, two of his sons seem to have ruled simultaneously, and around 915 a son of Olav's son Gnupa and Danish noblewoman Asfrid became king. This young man, whose name was Sigtrygg, is remembered on two runestones erected by his mother after his death.<br>
<br>
And this is where Harthacnut enters the picture. Probably born in the 880s, he was the son of an otherwise unknown "Sweyn", and is often described as being the grandson (or adopted grandson) of semi-mythic viking chieftain Sigurd Snake-Eye, one of the sons of the legendary Ragnar Lodbrok. This is however impossible to verify. Adam says that Harthacnut (Danish: Hardeknud) came from "Northmannia", the "land of the Northmen", by which he may mean either Norway or Normandy, which had recently been colonized by Danish vikings. But it is also likely that Harthacnut was brought up in the Danelaw territories in East Anglia.<br>
<br>
He must have been a full-grown man with a certain reputation when he came (back?) to Denmark around 916, and according to Adam and his star witness king Sweyn, Harthacnut immediately deposed the young king Sigtrygg. This happened "in the last days of archbishop Hoger", says Adam, and Hoger died around 917. Harthacnut then ruled unopposed for approximately thirty years, and while some researchers have used a single somewhat dubious source, the Saxon chronicles of Widukind, to establish that Sigtrygg's father Gnupa was still king in 934 when the Danes had an altercation with German king Heinrich, there can be little doubt that the king who was supposedly forced to pay a tribute to the German ruler was in fact Harthacnut. Claims that king Heinrich I forced the "heathen" Danish king to be baptized are almost certainly erroneous.<br>
<br>
In 948, the archbishop of Bremen appointed three bishops to Denmark, and that probably signifies a change in government...Harthacnut is usually portrayed as indifferent or hostile towards Christianity, and while that may only be the church's interpretation, it seems likely that a new and more open-minded king had ascended to the throne around 947 or 948.<br>
</p>
Svend I Tveskæg of DENMARK
<p>
<a name ="I005566"><b>[I005566]</b></a><br />
From Wikipedia<br>
<br>
Sweyn I "Forkbeard" (Svein Otto Haraldsson; Danish: Svend Tveskæg, originally Tjugeskæg or Tyvskæg, Norwegian: Svein Tjugeskjegg) (c. 960 - February 3, 1014). Sveyn I succeeded his father Harold I as king of Denmark, probably in late 986 or early 987. Sweyn had coins made with his likeness, being the first Danish king to do so. The inscription read "Zven, Rex ad Dener".<br>
<br>
Adam of Bremen, who is strongly anti-Sweyn, claims that Sweyn Forkbeard was deposed by king Eric the Victorious of Sweden, who ruled Denmark "for fourteen years". However, Eric died in 994 and would thus have had to conquer Denmark around 980, long before Sweyn became king and at a time when his father Harold was the king of Denmark, so the long time of Eric's rule may be wrong.<br>
<br>
Following the battle of Swold in the year 1000, and the death of Norway's king Olaf I, Sweyn established Danish control over a part of Norway, with Eirik Håkonsson Earl as his vassal. The year of his birth is unknown, but he had almost certainly been born when his father accepted Christianity, probably around 960, and he (Sweyn) was given the Christian name Otto after the German emperor. After participating in a Norwegian-led raid against England in 994-995, Sweyn embarked on a series of full-scale invasions (1003-1005, 1006-1007, 1009-1012 and 1013) following the St. Brice's Day massacre of England's Danish inhabitants (November 1002). In 1013 the king himself led the Danish fleet in a full-scale invasion, and the Danes landed at Sandwich and turned towards London. But the Londoners are said to have destroyed the bridges that spanned the river Thames ("London Bridge is falling down"), and Sweyn suffered heavy losses and had to withdraw. He then led his army far into the old Danelaw territory north of Humber and the inhabitants hailed him as their king with barely a drop of blood spilled along the way. One by one, the northern kingdoms fell to Sweyn Forkbeard, and then the southern kingdoms followed suit, until London was alone, isolated within a country which had completely surrendered. Sweyn Forkbeard was finally accepted as the King of England following the flight to Normandy of king Ethelred the Unready in late 1013.<br>
<br>
Sweyn died at Gainsborough in Lincolnshire, having ruled England unopposed for only five weeks, and his body was returned to Denmark. He was succeeded as King of Denmark by his elder son, Harold II; the Danish fleet proclaimed his younger son Canute the Great as King of England, but they and he returned to Denmark, with Ethelred being restored. Later, Canute ruled in Denmark, England, Norway and some parts of northern Germany.<br>
<br>
Sweyn Forkbeard's nickname, which was probably used during his lifetime, refers to a long, pitchfork-like moustache, a "tjuge" in Old Norse, not to a full beard. Such a moustache was fashionable at the time, particularly in England.<br>
