Gary Andrew KEITH
<p>
<a name ="I097114"><b>[I097114]</b></a><br />
March 15, 1945 - Berwick - April 1, 2019 - Calgary, Alta. It is with great sadness that the family of Gary Andrew Keith announces his passing on Monday, April 1, 2019. Gary was a larger than life man in personality as well as stature and has left the same size hole in all of our hearts and lives. He was a rarity, a man of integrity and honor. The Keith family motto is Veritas Vincit - "Truth Conquers" and he lived his life by that precept. He was incredibly proud of his Scottish heritage, "his" castle Dunnotar near Stonehaven, Aberdeenshire, and of being a proud son of Nova Scotia. Born in Berwick, he was the last surviving member of his immediate family. He was predeceased by his parents, Andrew and Elizabeth Keith; and his brothers, David and Ronald. He leaves behind his wife, best friend and soulmate, Roselee. Theirs was a whirlwind romance; they met at the ages of 19 and 22, were engaged after 48 hours and have been together every since. Gary's legacy will be carried on by his daughters, Jennifer (Dean), and Katherine (Ben); his son, Andrew; his grandchildren, Bethany and Kelton; and nieces, Sherry Kimble and Debbie Keith. As per Gary's long-held wishes, there will be no public funeral service. The family will be bringing Gary's ashes home to Nova Scotia and interring him in the Bay of Fundy at sunset, accompanied by the playing of his favourite bagpipes (or a Meatloaf album). Condolences may be forwarded through: www.mcinnisandholloway.com "Goodbyes are only for those who love with their eyes. Because for those who love with their heart and soul, there is no separation". In living memory of Gary Keith, a tree will be planted in Fish Creek Provincial Park<br>
