Edgar Parker BYERS
<p>
<a name ="I013701"><b>[I013701]</b></a><br />
A newspaper article, date unknown, describes the Byers Brothers Flour Mill, in Camrose, Alberta, a small town south east of Edmonton. Edgar and his brother Walter H. Byers were the proprietors of the mill.<br>
Walter was a well known owner of Byers store in New Annan. He went west in June of 1926 to start the mill.<br>
It is said Edgar got " lonely in new Annan, so he picked one of the pretty girls of that highly favored district, appeared suddenly at the door of a well known manse in New Brunswick and there the golden knot was tied, for better or for worse" and the happy couple went to join the brother miller and his family in this far off town. --PL<br>

George Albert BYRD
<p>
<a name ="I074943"><b>[I074943]</b></a><br />
It is said that George was the youngest cowboy in California. Due to the dire family circumstances he was put on a horse at the age of eight and instead of being sent to school, was sent out to herd cattle, which left him woefully ignorant and with a limited, but colorful vocabulary phrases such as " Hell's afloat and the devil can't swim" and the "devil's to pay, and there's no hot pitch." were attributed to Uncle George by niece Eva Evans.<br>
In 1910 Federal Census he is listed with wife, Belle, 41 and son Hue y,1 0 in Crane Valley, Madera Co., CA. He is a sawmill laborer.<br>
In 1930 census, George, 67 is in Red Bluff, Tehama, CA, with wife Christiana, 65<br>
It appears George and Belle may have had another child died in 1903, the Visalia Cemetery lists an infant, son of George Byrd.<br>
In 1910 Federal Census he is listed with wife, Belle, 41 and son Huey, 10 in Crane Valley, Madera Co., CA. He is a sawmill laborer.<br>
In 1930 census, George, 67 is in Red Bluff, Tehama, CA, with wife Christiana, 65<br>
It appears George and Belle may have had another child who died in 1903, the Visalia Cemetery lists an infant, son of George Byrd.<br>
George married Belle's younger sister Rosa in 1913, but the marriage did not apparently last long, not long enough to have a child and before19 19. He married again in 1919 to Christiana Weaver. Rosa Byrd's death certificate indicates she was divorced, and that she didnʼt remarry.<br>
George appears to be the only one of Jesse Albert Byrd's sons to have sons who had sons, carrying on the Byrd surname. His brothers Wm. Albert had two sons who married but had no children and his brother Oliver Perry, had one son who married but had no children. Many of Jesse's daughter s and granddaughters and their sons and daughters had children.<br>

Vera BYTIUHA
<p>
<a name ="I045480"><b>[I045480]</b></a><br />
VERA KOPYNSKY (nee BYTIUHA) 1920 - 2012 Our beloved mother and grandmother, Vera Kopynsky (nee Bytiuha) passed away peacefully on September 9, 2012 at Holy Family Home. She is survived by her daughters Maria Halkewycz (Bohdan), Christina (Ken McKeen) and Katherine McKay (Richard); grandson Andrei Halkewycz, granddaughter Daria McKay, her special nieces Halyna, Irena, Lesia, and Raisa and family in Ukraine. She was predeceased by her husband, Michael, her parents and all five of her brothers and sisters. Vera was born in Szlatyn in the Cholm region of Ukraine on May 11, 1920 to Pavlo Kirilovich Bytiuha and Maria Antonina Viter. She had a happy childhood as one of six children in a prosperous and secure home. She finished her secondary schooling in Lubaczow and began working in the local civil administration. Here she met Michael, a young lawyer and teacher and in the midst of war, she and Michael married. Caught between the retreating German Nazi and the approaching Soviet Communist armies, she and her husband fled westward, first to Vienna and then to a displaced person's camp in Bertesgaden, where Maria was born. They applied to Canada as stateless refugees and in July, 1948, arrived at Pier 21, Halifax. The vibrant Ukrainian community of St. Boniface embraced the young family and their early lives centered around UNF (St. Boniface) and Sts. Peter and Paul Church. Life was hard and survival difficult in an unfamiliar land. Vera worked long hours in the fur industry to help support the family and later to help her husband obtain his Masters of Social Work degree. With the births of Christina and Katherine, she became a full time homemaker, and devoted herself to the upbringing of her three daughters. Strict and uncompromising, she taught them to achieve their best by the example of her enormous capacity for work. She worked, created a magnificent garden, ran the entire house and sewed almost all the girls' clothes. Her grandchildren Andrei and Daria spent many of their childhood days with her. Their beloved Babycia taught them to make babka and pyrohu and kept them laughing throughout those days. Always, Vera and Michael felt a deep gratitude to this country of Canada that gave them and their children the rights and liberties of a free society. With the death of Michael in 1990, Vera continued in her own home, as the foundation and focus of her family, until her move to Holy Family Home in 2008. We wish to express our special thanks to Yuri and Marika Nosyk for their kindness to our mother, to Dr. Taras Babick and the staff at Holy Family for their care and invaluable advice. We mourn our mother and grandmother, but are content that she rests in peace after a full, exciting and tumultuous life. Vichna ii Pamiyat. Funeral services will be at the Ukrainian Orthodox Cathedral of Saint Mary the Protectress, 820 Burrows Avenue at 10:00 a.m. on Saturday, September 15 with Rev. Fr. A. Harkavyi officiating. Interment at All Saints Cemetery will follow. In lieu of flowers, donations in Vera's memory may be made to the Ukrainian Cultural and Educational Centre, 184 Alexander Ave. E., Winnipeg, MB R3B 0L6.

Constantine IX of BYZANTHIUM
<p>
<a name ="I015221"><b>[I015221]</b></a><br />
From Wikipedia<br>
<br>
Constantine IX Monomachus (c. 1000 - January 11, 1055) reigned as Byzantine emperor from June 11, 1042 to January 11, 1055. He had been chosen by Zoë as a husband and co-emperor in 1042, although he had been exiled for conspiring against her previous husband Michael IV. They ruled together until Zoë died in 1050.<br>
<br>
In 1043 he relieved General George Maniaces from his command in Italy, and Maniaces declared himself emperor. His troops were about to defeat Constantine in battle, but he was wounded and died on the field, ending the crisis. Immediately after the victory, Constantine was attacked by a fleet from the Kievan Rus', which had probably been hired by Maniaces. They too were defeated, with the help of Greek fire.<br>
<br>
In 1046 the Byzantines came into contact for the first time with the Seljuks. They met in battle in Armenia in 1048, and settled a truce the following year. However, Constantine was forced to disband the Armenian troops for financial reasons in 1053, leaving the eastern frontier poorly defended.<br>
<br>
In 1054 the centuries-old differences between the Greek and Roman churches led to their final separation. Legates from Pope Leo IX excommunicated the Patriarch of Constantinople Michael Cerularius when Cerularius would not agree to adopt western church practises, and in return Cerularius excommunicated the legates. This annulled Constantine's attempts to ally with the Pope against the Normans.<br>
<br>
Constantine tried to intervene, but he fell ill and died on January 11 of the following year. Theodora, the elderly daughter of Constantine VIII who had ruled with her sister Zoë, was recalled and named empress.<br>
<br>
Constantine was also a patron of the scholar Michael Psellus the Younger, whose Chronographica records the history of Constantine's reign.<br>
<br>
Constantine's nickname, Monomachos (one who fights alone) was inherited by his grandson, Vladimir Monomakh.<br>

Hyel ap CADELL
<p>
<a name ="I004627"><b>[I004627]</b></a><br />
From Wikipedia<br>
<br>
Howell the Good (c.880?-950; Welsh: Hywel Dda or Hywel ap Cadell) is listed amongst the kings of Gwynedd. He is remembered as one of the most successful native Welsh rulers prior to the Norman Conquest. As a result of his reign, Wales ended the 10th century with a set of codified laws considerably more sophisticated than those of contemporary England.<br>
<br>
Howell was born in around 880, the younger son of Cadell ap Rhodri, himself the son of Rhodri the Great. In 905, Cadell, having conquered Dyfed, gave it to his son to rule on his behalf. Howell was able to consolidate his position by marrying Elen, whose father had ruled Dyfed until his death. Following his father's death in 909, he acquired a share of Seisyllwg, and on his brother's death in 920, he merged Dyfed and Seisyllwg, creating for himself a new kingdom, which became known as Deheubarth. Following the death of a cousin in 942, he also inherited the principality of Gwynedd, becoming ruler of about three-quarters of present-day Wales.<br>
<br>
Howell's reign, uncharacteristically for the time, was a peaceful one, and he achieved an understanding with Athelstan of England. Such was the relationship between the neighbouring countries that Howell was able to mint his own coinage in the English city of Chester. He was the only Welsh ruler ever to produce coinage. His study of the English legal system and his visit to Rome in 928 (on a pilgrimage) combined to enable him to formulate advanced ideas about government. (He would possibly have a chance to meet either of the Popes John X, Leo VI and Stephen VIII who were active during that year).<br>
<br>
The conference held at Whitland in about 945, was a kind of parliament in which Welsh law was codified and set down in writing for posterity, much of the work being done by the celebrated clerk, Blegywryd. Following Howell's death, his kingdom was soon split into three and divided between his sons. However, his legacy endured in the form of his enlightened laws, which remained in active use throughout Wales until the conquest.<br>

Cadwallon ap Cadfan (c. 591-633/634) was the King of Gwynedd from around 625 until his death in battle in 633 or 634. The son and successor of Cadfan ap Iago, he is best remembered for devastating Northumbria and defeating and killing its king, Edwin, prior to his own death in battle against Oswald of Bernicia.<br>
<br>
Cadwallon was initially defeated by Edwin of Northumbria, who invaded Anglesey, and was besieged by the Northumbrians at Priestholm (or Glannauc), a small island off eastern Anglesey. The Annales Cambriae dates this siege to 629. [1] According to Geoffrey of Monmouth's History of the Kings of Britain (which includes a fairly extensive account of Cadwallon's life but is largely legendary-for example, Geoffrey has Cadwallon surviving until after the Battle of Winwaed in 654 or 655), Cadwallon subsequently went to Ireland, and then to the island of Guernsey. From there, according to Geoffrey, Cadwallon led an army into Dumnonia, where he encountered and defeated the Mercians besieging Exeter, and forced their king, Penda, into an alliance. Geoffrey also reports that Cadwallon married a half-sister of Penda. However, his history is, on this as well as all matters, suspect, and it should be treated with caution.<br>
<br>
In any case, Penda and Cadwallon together made war against the Northumbrians. A battle was fought at Hatfield Chase on October 12, 633 (or 632, according to another interpretation of the chronology), which ended in the defeat and death of Edwin and his son Osfrith. After this, the Kingdom of Northumbria fell into disarray, divided between its sub-kingdoms of Deira and Bernicia, but the war continued: according to the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, "Cadwallon and Penda went and did for the whole land of Northumbria". Bede, in his Ecclesiastical History of the English People, tells us that Cadwallon was besieged by the new king of Deira, Osric, "in a strong town"; Cadwallon, however, "sallied out on a sudden with all his forces, by surprise, and destroyed him [Osric] and all his army." After this, according to Bede, Cadwallon ruled over the "provinces of the Northumbrians" for a year, "not like a victorious king, but like a rapacious and bloody tyrant." Furthermore, Bede tells us that "...Cadwalla [Cadwallon], though he bore the name and professed himself a Christian, was so barbarous in his disposition and behaviour, that he neither spared the female sex, nor the innocent age of children, but with savage cruelty put them to tormenting deaths, ravaging all their country for a long time, and resolving to cut off all the race of the English within the borders of Britain."<br>
<br>
The king of Bernicia, Eanfrith, was also killed by Cadwallon when the former went to him in an attempt to negotiate peace. However, Cadwallon was defeated by an army under Eanfrith's brother, Oswald, at the Battle of Heavenfield, "though he had most numerous forces, which he boasted nothing could withstand". Cadwallon's soldiers fled after a battle, and he was killed at a place called "Denis's-brook".<br>
