Douglas Randall Petrie, age 77, of Canning, born on March 23, 1942 in Wolfville, passed away at home on March 25, 2019. Predeceased by his wife, Rachel; and parents, Enid (Coldwell) and James Petrie, he is survived by his daughter, Julia (Derek) Merryweather; sons, Robert (Karen) and James (Niki) Petrie; sister, Allison; and niece, Natalia. Doug grew up in Kentville and attended Kings County Academy, the Nova Scotia Agricultural College and MacDonald College of McGill University achieving a Bachelor of Science in Agriculture in 1965 but always returned to the Valley to work on the farm and to see Rachel, who he married in 1968. Together they started farming and raising a family in Hillaton. Many happy years were spent growing tobacco, apples and turnips and spending leisure time at the cottage in Hall's Harbour. Doug eventually transitioned from farming to crop consulting, working for a number of agri-service companies where he regularly travelled the Maritimes developing relationships with many new friends and colleagues in the agricultural industry. A keen crib player, many evenings were spent playing with his friends at the kitchen table. He became a faithful fan of the Acadia Axemen and was a regular at the arena. An avid reader, he always had a book on the go, usually a mystery, reflecting his thoughtful, curious nature. Despite the hard work of family, farming and business, Doug and Rachel also knew how to have fun and their home and cottage were regular gathering places for their friends and good times. While Doug's hobbies were hockey, cards and his woodpile, his passions were his children and Rachel. Doug earned admiration and respect for the unwavering care and love he gave to Rachel in her years of illness. His patience, perseverance and faithfulness through difficult times were an example to all. Cremation has taken place and there will be no visitation, by request. The funeral service, followed by a reception, will be held at 2 p.m. on Sunday, March 31st, in White Family Funeral Home, Kentville. <br>

Don A. PETRUCCELLI
<p>
<a name ="I101402"><b>[I101402]</b></a><br />
DAVENPORT -- Don A. Petruccelli, longtime Scott County public servant, died in St. Paul, Minn., where he resided for the last five months of his life. He was 89 and died in his sleep.<br>
In a public career that included serving as a Scott County associate judge, Petruccelli looked upon his various public roles as a trust that allowed him to serve the interest of his community and country.<br>
Petruccelli's parents, who came to the United States from Italy, moved from Massachusetts to Davenport in 1914, where they set up a shoe-repair business.<br>
Petruccelli graduated from Davenport High School and St. Ambrose College before receiving his law degree from the University of South Dakota in 1940.<br>
He set up a private law practice in Davenport but then was drafted into the Army. Petruccelli, who spoke fluent Italian, ended up as an espionage agent during World War II, working in Italy for the Office of Strategic Services, and attained the rank of major. He worked at the State Department in Washington in 1946 before his discharge.<br>
Back to Davenport after the war, he resumed his law practice and then served two terms in the Iowa Legislature, starting in 1954.<br>
When the mayor of Davenport died in 1957, Petruccelli was asked to run and won election to fill out that term, and he won two more two-year terms as mayor.<br>
When he lost in a primary race, Petruccelli returned to private practice, then worked as an assistant Scott County attorney before winning a municipal judgeship in 1971. From 1971 until 1985, he served as a full-time judge in charge of all juvenile matters in Scott County. From 1985 until 1991, he served as a senior judge.<br>
He considered his work as a juvenile court judge the most important contribution made in his public career. He believed that the juvenile court system allowed him, the probation department and the lawyers who appeared in the court to make positive differences in the lives of those children whose circumstances or conduct mandated public intervention and attention.<br>
He married Carol Selitto on Oct. 7, 1945, in South Orange, N.J. She preceded him in death on May 19, 1977. He later married Edna Palmisano on Dec. 17, 1982. She preceded him in death in July 1990.<br>
Surviving are his daughter, Amy, and her husband, Dr. Jack Fistler, St. Paul; a daughter, the Rev. Dr. Linda Petrucelli, and her husband, Gary Hoff, Hilo, Hawaii; and a son, Vincent, and his wife, Noralee Petrucelli, who reside in Iron River, Mich. He also is survived by two grandchildren and a sister.<br>
A service will be 11 a.m. Friday at Trinity Episcopal Cathedral, Davenport. The family will receive friends before the service at the cathedral after 10 a.m. Private family burial will be in Davenport Memorial Park. In lieu of flowers, the family prefers memorial gifts may be made to The Honorable Don A. Petruccelli Scholarship Fund at Hamline University School of Law, St. Paul, MN 55104.<br>
Weerts Funeral Home is in charge of arrangements.<br>

Don A. Petrucelli, 89 Davenport mayor, associate judge<br>
Don A. Petruccelli, a former Davenport mayor and Scott County associate judge known for the stern and sometimes very tough approach he took with juveniles who appeared in his courtroom, died Tuesday in St. Paul, Minn.<br>
He was 89 and had resided in Minnesota the past five months.<br>
Petruccelli, a native of Italy who moved from Massachusetts to Davenport in 1914, when his parents set up a shoe-repair business, won an election to complete the term when the mayor of Davenport died in 1957. Petruccelli won a pair of two-year terms as mayor.<br>
When he later lost a primary election race, Petruccelli returned to private law practice, then worked as an assistant in the Scott County Attorney's office before winning a judgeship by election in 1971.<br>
He edged out the judge assigned to juvenile court with a campaign complaining that the incumbent was not tough enough on juvenile offenders.<br>
"He shot from the hip and used common sense and good judgment to make his calls," said Scott County Attorney Bill Davis, who worked in the courthouse with Petruccelli for 15 years.<br>
One time, Davis said, he found out that a 17-year-old who had been convicted and sentenced to prison had lied to prosecutors about his age so he could be tried as an adult.<br>
The teen lied because, when he had run into trouble before, Petruccelli told him he never wanted to see him in his courtroom again, Davis explained.<br>
Petruccelli also presided over about 100 wedding services a year, Scott County District Judge Bobbi Alpers said. Sometimes, couples called her to do weddings only because Petruccelli's schedule was booked.<br>
"A lot of people felt he did a good job," she said, adding that Petruccelli remained active around his house after retiring in 1985.<br>
Petruccelli retired not because he wanted to, but because he reached the age of 72, the mandatory retirement age for judges in Iowa. He served as a senior judge, filling in when other judges were absent, until age 78.<br>
Petruccelli graduated from Davenport High School and St. Ambrose College before receiving his law degree from the University of South Dakota in 1940.<br>
Visitation will begin at 10 a.m. today at Trinity Episcopal Cathedral in Davenport. Services will follow there at 11 a.m.<br>
