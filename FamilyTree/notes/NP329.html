<p>
<a name ="I070272"><b>[I070272]</b></a><br />
William "Bill" D. Lloyd, 75, and a resident of Albuquerque died September 21, 2001 while peacefully reading at his home. A private gathering of his children will be held later. Mr. Lloyd was born May 20, 1926 in Miami, FL. As an infant, he moved with his family to Yuma, AZ where he worked with his father and older brother in the family's construction business. Mr. Lloyd joined the U.S. Naval Reserve in 1942 and attended the University of Southern California, graduating with a Bachelor of Civil Engineering Degree in 1948, the same year he was honorably discharged from the Navy. Mr. Lloyd worked as a civil engineer for the Los Angeles Dept. of Power and Water from 1948-57, when he and his wife, Mildred (Cahill) Lloyd, moved to Alaska. The couple and their children homesteaded 160 acres, working together to construct a road to their homestead, build a cabin, and"prove up" on their land patent. For most of his career, Mr. Lloyd worked for the Army Corps of Engineers in Anchorage, where he was chief of the Urban Studies Section from 1975-79, and chief of the Environmental Section from 1979 until his retirement in 1990. Following a stroke, Mr. Lloyd relocated to Albuquerque, where he made his home until this year. His family said,"Bill was a truly kind man, gentle, with a wonderfully dry sense of humor. He worked incredibly hard for his family, and he could build or fix anything. Bill had an encyclopedic mind, and loved to read. His love of books rubbed off on his kids, three of his six grown children own bookstores. He will be missed by his family and his many friends in Alaska and outside." Mr. Lloyd is survived by his daughters, Linda Danielson of Bisbee, AZ, Cynthia Heath of Albuquerque and Sharon Lloyd of Seattle, WA; and by his sons and daughters-in-law, John and Sue Lloyd of Redding, CA, David and Debra Lloyd of Anchorage, AK and Steve Lloyd and Julie Drake of Anchorage, AK. Mr. Lloyd also leaves 13 grandchildren; and two great-grandchildren. He was preceded in death by his parents, John Dennison Lloyd and Dorothy (Ball) Lloyd; his brother, Roland Lloyd; his sister, Olive (Lloyd) McNeill; and two grandchildren, Gregory Hildebrandt, and Daniel Hildebrandt. At his wish, Mr. Lloyd's ashes will be scattered in the mountains outside Albuquerque and over Cook Inlet, Alaska on an outgoing tide. The family requests that memorial contributions be made to the American Red Cross.<br>

Dafydd ap LLYWELYN
<p>
<a name ="I010540"><b>[I010540]</b></a><br />
From Wikipedia<br>
<br>
Gruffydd ap Llywelyn (c. 1200-March 1, 1244) was the eldest, illegitimate son of Llywelyn the Great. Under Welsh law, he might reasonably have expected to succeed his father, but Llywelyn had married a daughter of King John, and preferred his legitimate son, Dafydd, who was obliged to imprison his half-brother in order to secure his own inheritance. Following a successful invasion of the Welsh borders by King Henry III of England in 1241, the king took Gruffydd into custody. The headstrong and impatient Gruffydd fell to his death while attempting to escape from the Tower of London. This was the second time Gruffydd had found himself in English custody. As a boy, he had been one of the hostages taken by King John as a pledge for his father's good faith. One of the reasons for his shoddy treatment was that he presented a threat to his half-brother, Dafydd, who was half-English. Moreover, Gruffydd being a bastard in English eyes, it would be a bad precedent if he were allowed to inherit Gwynedd.<br>
<br>
After his death, however, Gruffydd's four sons-Owain, Llywelyn, Dafydd and Rhodri-would come into their own, and, after much fraternal discord, Llywelyn ended up ruling most of Wales.<br>
</p>
Gruffydd ap LLYWELYN
<p>
<a name ="I004615"><b>[I004615]</b></a><br />
From Wikipedia, 12 June 2006:<br>
<br>
Gruffydd ap Llywelyn (c. 1000 - August 5, 1063) was the ruler of all Wales from 1055 until his death, one of very few able to make this boast. He was of a cadet branch of the princely house of Mathrafal of Powys, though himself not described as being royal.<br>
<br>
Genealogy and early life<br>
<br>
Gruffydd was the only son of Llywelyn ap Seisyll, who had been able to seize both Gwynedd and Powys from their traditional dynasties. On Llywelyn's death in 1033, a member of the traditional Aberffraw dynasty, Iago ab Idwal ap Meurig, became ruler of Gwynedd. Gruffydd according to tradition had been a lazy youth, but one New Year's Eve, he was driven out of the house by his exasperated sister. Leaning against the wall of another house, he heard a cook who was boiling pieces of beef in a cauldron complain that there was one piece of meat which kept coming to the top of the cauldron, however often it was thrust down. Gruffydd took the comment to apply to him, and began to work to gain power.<br>
<br>
King of Gwynedd and Powys 1039-1055<br>
<br>
In 1039 Iago ab Idwal was killed by his own men (his son Cynan ap Iago went into exile in Dublin) and Gruffydd already the usurper-king of Powys was able to become king of Gwynedd by 1039. Soon after gaining power he surprised a Mercian army at Rhyd y Groes near Welshpool and totally defeated it, killing its leader, Edwin, the brother of Earl Leofric of Mercia. He then attacked the neighbouring principality of Deheubarth which was now ruled by Hywel ab Edwin. Gruffydd defeated Hywel in a battle at Pencader in 1041 and carried off Hywel's wife. Gruffydd seems to have been able to drive Hywel out of Deheubarth in about 1043, for in 1044 Hywel is recorded as returning with a Danish fleet to the mouth of the River Tywi to try to reclaim his kingdom. Gruffydd however defeated and killed him.<br>
<br>
Gruffydd ap Rhydderch of Gwent was able to expel Gruffydd ap Llywelyn from Deheubarth in 1047 and became king of Deheubarth himself after the nobles of Ystrad Tywi had suddenly attacked and killed 140 of Gruffydd ap Llywelyn's household guard. He was able to resist several attacks by Gruffydd ap Llywelyn in the following years. Gruffydd ap Llywelyn was active on the Welsh border in 1052, when he attacked Herefordshire and defeated a mixed force of Normans and English near Leominster.<br>
<br>
King of Wales 1055-1063<br>
<br>
In 1055 Gruffydd ap Llywelyn killed his rival Gruffydd ap Rhydderch in battle and recaptured Deheubarth. Gruffydd now allied himself with Ælfgar, son of Earl Leofric of Mercia, who had been deprived of his earldom of East Anglia by Harold Godwinson and his brothers. They marched on Hereford and were opposed by a force led by the Earl of Hereford, Ralph the Timid. This force was mounted and armed in the Norman fashion, but on October 24 Gruffydd defeated it. He then sacked the city and destroyed its Norman castle. Earl Harold was given the task of counter attacking, but was not able to penetrate very far. Shortly afterwards Ælfgar was restored to his earldom and a peace treaty concluded. Gruffydd married Ælfgar's daughter, Ealdgyth.<br>
<br>
Around this time Gruffydd was also able to seize Morgannwg and Gwent, along with extensive territories along the border with England. In 1056 he won another victory over an English army near Glasbury. He now claimed sovereignty over the whole of Wales - a claim which was recognised by the English.<br>
<br>
Death and aftermath<br>
<br>
Gruffydd reached an agreement with Edward the Confessor, but the death of his ally Ælfgar in 1062 left him more vulnerable. In late 1062 Harold Godwinson obtained the king's approval for a surprise attack on Gruffydd's court at Rhuddlan. Gruffydd was nearly captured, but was warned in time to escape out to sea in one of his ships, though his other ships were destroyed. In the spring of 1063 Harold's brother Tostig led an army into north Wales while Harold led to fleet first to south Wales and then north to meet with his brother's army. Gruffydd was forced to take refuge in Snowdonia, but at this stage his own men killed him, on 5 August according to Brut y Tywysogion. The Ulster Chronicle states that he was killed by Cynan ap Iago, whose father Iago ab Idwal had been put to death by Gruffydd in 1039. [1] Gruffydd had probably made enemies in the course of uniting Wales under his rule. Walter Map has preserved a comment from Gruffydd himself about this:<br>
    Speak not of killing; I but blunt the horns of the offspring of Wales lest they should injure their dam.<br>
<br>
Gruffydd's head and the figurehead of his ship were sent to Harold.<br>
<br>
Following Gruffydd's death, Harold married his widow Ealdgyth, though she was to be widowed again three years later. Gruffydd's realm was divided again into the traditional kingdoms. Bleddyn ap Cynfyn and his brother Rhiwallon came to an agreement with Harold and were given the rule of Gwynedd and Powys. Thus when Harold was defeated and killed at the Battle of Hastings in 1066 the Normans reaching the borders of Wales were confronted by the traditional kingdoms rather than a single king. Gruffydd left two sons who in 1070 challenged Bleddyn and Rhiwallon at the battle of Mechain in an attempt to win back part of their father's kingdom. However they were defeated, one being killed and the other dying of exposure after the battle.<br>

Children:<br>
    * Maredudd ap Gruffydd (died 1070)<br>
    * Idwal ap Gruffydd (died 1070)<br>
    * Nesta verch Gruffydd, married Osbern FitzRichard<br>

Lyle Lobel Warner, a longtime Cambridge resident, died in her beloved Mount Auburn Street apartment on Sept. 6. She was 84 and had summered on the Vineyard for many years.<br>
Born and raised in Brooklyn, N.Y., the daughter of Jewish immigrants much taken by the American Dream, she became part of a very American linguistic group: Brooklynites who unlearned the local accent in order to be accepted in the country as a whole. She took pride in fooling cab drivers, who could not tell where she was from.<br>
After graduating from Smith College, Lyle came to Radcliffe, and there, in Cambridge, met Sam Bass Warner Jr., a future professor of history with whom she had four children: Rebecca, William, Kate (of West Tisbury) and Alice. In the wake of the second World War, she went to France to help care for Jewish orphans. Thus began a lifetime commitment to social work. She earned a masterʼs degree in the field from Washington University and a Ph.D. from Smith. She worked with people with addictions and studied the development of adopted children, as well as working with Selma Fraiberg doing further research on child development. She taught at Boston University and was a Bunting fellow at the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study.<br>
A lover of learning, progressive politics, good food, classical music and birds, Lyle found her spiritual home in winters in Cambridge and summers on Marthaʼs Vineyard. She summered at Quenames for 10 years and then built a house on Tisbury Great Pond where she summered for 40 years. She was an avid birder and often went out with Ed Chalif, Susan Whiting, Vern Laux, Dooley Rosenwald, Jay Eliasburg, Norman Asher and others.<br>
In her latter decades she was devoted to the peer-led courses at the Harvard Institute for Learning in Retirement, as well as to playing the piano, going to the symphony and taking walks in Mount Auburn Cemetery, where her ashes will be interred. She called her apartment building an unintentional retirement community and appreciated the many good friends she made there.<br>
In her final years her mobility was increasingly restricted by emphysema. She missed many things: being able to travel the world, going on bird-watching trips, visiting New York, and going to the opera. And yet, in many ways, her last decade was her best, as she enjoyed the company of many friends and the steady growth and friendship of her four grandchildren: Dan, Eve, Sashka and Jonah.<br>

<p>
<a name ="I027093"><b>[I027093]</b></a><br />
On Oct. 28, 2005, Tatum Lockwood, 16, and her younger sister Deidre, 14, were killed in an automobile accident on their way to school in Viborg.<br>
One year later, their mother Wendy Lieberg decided that the anniversary of their death should not be one of despair, but one of hope. With that in mind, she organized the "Angels of Hope" tribute concert, which will be Saturday night in the Viborg School Gym --- the very same place the funeral service for the two girls was held one year earlier.<br>
The concert is meant to be a message of hope.<br>
"This evening is meant to remind us that every day is a gift. There is hope for any situation that confronts us in our life's journey," says Lieberg, who is an Aberdeen native.<br>
Tatum was a junior at Viborg High School and was involved in volleyball, basketball and on the student council. She was described as a "social butterfly" who made friends easily.<br>
Deidre was a freshman at Viborg and was also involved in volleyball and basketball. She was a Packers fan and loved her close-knit group of friends.<br>
Lieberg, 41, her brother Kelly of Sioux Falls and her sister Lora (Schanzenbach) of Aberdeen, are graduates of Roncalli High School. Wendy is the daughter of Sharon Lieberg of Aberdeen and the late Bruce Lieberg.<br>
Tatum and Deidre's father is David Lockwood of Viborg. Their older sister, Lindsey, is a sophomore at South Dakota State University in Brookings.<br>
Three bands will be featured on Saturday night. FROG (Friends Rejoicing Over God) will begin playing at 6 p.m. while food is served. Then Menno-based Sons of Thunder and the headline band, Bread of Stone of Sioux City, Iowa, will play. Both bands performed at the Eternal Rescue Outdoor Music Festival in Yankton. Bread of Stone has also played at the Lifelight festival in Sioux Falls.<br>
Jared Wockenfuss of Dallas, Texas, a former Yankton youth pastor and motivational speaker, will present "Every Day Is A Gift."<br>
There is no admission charge for the concert or refreshment, but a freewill offering will be taken. T-shirts will be sold for $10 to help offset expenses. Any proceeds will go to Christian youth organizations such as FROG and Camp Judson, where Tatum, Deidre and their sister Lindsey had attended church camp.<br>

Viborg Car Accident Kills Two Teenagers<br>
A Friday morning car crash that happened just north of Viborg killed the two high school students.<br>
The accident happened just after 8:00 Friday morning. Officials say two cars collided at the intersection of 454th Ave and 289th Street in rural Viborg. Now a family and community is mourning the loss of two young girls.<br>
The two girls were on their way to school when the accident happened. Authorities say one vehicle was driving south on 454th avenue when it failed to yield and collided with a vehicle traveling west on 289th street.<br>
"Yield signs are there for a reason. For safety of people. Yield signs mean you're supposed to yield to oncoming traffic. You're not supposed to hurry to get through the intersection because it doesn't mean to stop because it does mean to stop," said Turner County Sheriff Byron Nogelmeier.<br>
Officials in Turner County say 16-year old Tatum Lockwood and 14-year old Deidre Lockwood both died - both sisters. Authorities say the man driving the pick up truck, 40 year old Curtis Hora of Irene was not injured.<br>
Authorities say a white pick up truck and a white station wagon were both involved in the accident. Authorities are still investigating and reconstructing the accident but say the collision did cause one vehicle to roll and the other landed in a field.<br>
Authorities say it is unclear how fast both vehicles were traveling when they hit but say the speed limit on township gravel and country gravel roads is 55 miles per hour.<br>
Sheriff Nogelmeier said, "55 mph If everyone's going that speed it can create quite a collision."<br>
