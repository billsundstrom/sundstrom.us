 FRIGG
<p>
<a name ="I008142"><b>[I008142]</b></a><br />
In Norse mythology, Frigg or Frigga was said to be "foremost among the goddesses," 1 the wife of Odin, queen of the Æsir, and goddess of the sky. One of the Ásynjur, she is a goddess of marriage, motherhood, fertility, love, household management, and domestic arts. Her primary functions in the Norse mythological stories are as wife and mother, but these are not her only functions. She has the power of prophecy although she does not tell what she knows 2, and is the only one other than Odin who is permitted to sit on his high seat Hlidskjalf and look out over the universe. She also participates in the Wild Hunt (Asgardreid) along with her husband. Frigg's children are Baldr, Hod and Wecta; her stepchildren are Hermod, Heimdall, Tyr, Vidar, Vali, and Skjoldr. Thor is either her brother or a stepson. Frigg's compainion is Eir, the gods' doctor and goddess of healing. Frigg's attendants are Hlin (a goddess of protection), Gna (a messenger goddess), and Fulla (a fertility goddess). It is unclear whether Frigg's companions and attendants are simply different aspects of Frigg herself. (c.f. avatar.) According to the poem Lokasenna Frigg is the daughter of Fjorgyn (masculine version of "Earth," c.f. feminine version of "Earth," Thor's mother), her mother is not identified in the stories that have survived.<br>

Halfdan FRODASSON
<p>
<a name ="I008128"><b>[I008128]</b></a><br />
From Wikipedia<br>
<br>
Halfdan ("half dane") (Old Norse sources) or Healfdene (Beowulf) or Haldan (Danish Latin sources) was a legendary king of Denmark of the Skjöldung (Scylding) lineage, the son of king named Fródi in many accounts, noted mainly as the father to the two kings who succeeded him in the rule of Denmark, kings named Hrothgar and Halga and the Old English poem Beowulf and named Hróar and Helgi in Old Norse accounts.<br>
<br>
According to the Chronicon Lethrense and Saxo Grammaticus' Gesta Danorum (Book 2), Halfdan had two brothers named Ro and Skat who also sought the throne. Both were killed by Halfdan. Saxo adds that his brothers' supporters were hanged and that Halfdan continued to reign with great cruelty, but that he reigned long and died peaceably in extreme old age.<br>
<br>
The Ynglinga saga gives Halfdan (in this work also son of a king named Fródi) a brother named Fridleif and says both were great warriors but that Halfdan was the better of the two. This might have been a lead-in to a feud between the brothers if Snorri had been dealing with Danish matters rather than Swedish matters.<br>
<br>
Snorri here only tells us that Halfdan attacked King Aun of Sweden and drove him into exile into Götaland. Halfdan then ruled Sweden for twenty years until he died in Uppsala of sickness and was buried in a mound.<br>
<br>
According to Ynglinga saga, a Danish king named Fródi the Bold aided Aun's successor Egil against the rebelling thrall Tunni. This may be Froda the Heathobard of Beowulf who becomes Fródi the slayer of Halfdan in other Norse traditions which do not make his end peaceful.<br>
<br>
In the Saga of Hrolf Kraki, this Fródi is Halfdan's younger brother but in the Latin epitome to the Skjöldunga Saga the younger brother, here a half-brother, is named Ingjalldus and this Ingjalldus is later father of a son named Frothi. Since in Beowulf Froda is father of a son named Ingeld, it is usually considered that the names have accidently been interchanged in the tradition behind the Skjöldunga Saga. In the Saga of Hrolf Kraki, Fródi brother of Halfdan is ruler of a separate kingdom. Halfdan was calm and good-natured but Fródi was cruel and vicious. Fródi attacked Halfdan's hall by night and burned it. Halfdan was killed in the battle and Fródi took over his country and his widow.<br>
<br>
But eventually Halfdan's sons in turn killed Fródi to avenge their father's death. Thus the tradition in Beowulf of a feud between the Danes and Heathobards in which Fróda king of the Heathobards was slain appears in Norse texts as a family feud in which Halfdan's brother Fródi kills Halfdan and Halfdan's sons kill Fródi.<br>
