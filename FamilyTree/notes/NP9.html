LUDLOW - Eva Dorothy Anderson Glacy passed away at home quietly and unexpectedly on Saturday, September 23rd 2006, of suspected heart failure. Eva was born in Dorchester, Massachusetts, on March 3, 1925, daughter of Edward and Anna (Mortenson) Anderson. Eva grew up in West Roxbury and graduated from Roslindale High School and Fisher Business School. <br>
Eva worked at Harold Cabot in Boston where she met her future husband, Edward F. Glacy . They were married on May 27, 1950. Their marriage lasted almost 56 years until the death of her husband in April of this year. They lived in Westwood, Massachusetts, before retiring to Yarmouthport on the Cape for 12 years in which they were active in the antiques business. In 1997, they moved to Ludlow. They considered Vermont their home and loved their years here. <br>
She is survived by daughter and son-in-law, whom she cared for very much, Elizabeth "Betty" Glacy McEnaney and Bruce McEnaney. Her two grandsons, Scott and his wife Erin of Shaftsbury and Timothy of Hyannis, Massachusetts, were her pride and joy.

They are Audrey, Bob, Dianne and Steve Anderson. <br>
Eva will be remembered for her devotion to her husband and the love of her family. She had the joy of attending the wedding of one grandson in the past year, and in watching the other grow his artistic talent in metalwork. She will be missed by her good friends, who call themselves the Lunch Bunch, who were so good to her after her eyesight began to fail, and some girlhood chums whose friendship remained through all these years. Eve was a kind and sensitive woman and one who had a great passion for the Red Sox, rarely missing an inning. <br>
There will be no services, and burial will be private. In lieu of flowers, donations may be made in her memory to the Jimmy Fund, the longtime charity of the Boston Red Sox. <br>

CLINTON, Minnesota (SmallTownPapers) -- Memorial services for 87 year old Russell Anderson of Clinton, MN were held at 2:00 p.m., Sunday, January 15, 2012 at Trinity Lutheran Church of Clinton, MN. Minister Bev McNeill officiated at the service. Special music was provided by organist Bonnie Stotesbery and a song was sung by the grandchildren. Interment was held at the St. Pauli Cemetery of Clinton.<br>
Russell Harris Anderson was born at home on April 4, 1924 near Louisburg, MN to parents Manfred and Helen (Holen) Anderson. He was baptized and confirmed in the Louisburg Lutheran Church. Russ attended country school and graduated from Belling-ham High School in 1941.<br>
On September 19, 1946, Russell married Edna Rebehn, his high school sweetheart. They were blessed with five children and recently celebrated 65 years of marriage. They moved to the Clinton area shortly after their marriage, having purchased the last remaining Federal Land Bank farm in Big Stone County. They lived in a brooder house for a few weeks while waiting for the renters to move out. The first winter Russ and Edna learned to trap muskrats for grocery money. Son Keith and his wife Jane now live on the farm five miles southeast of Clinton. Son Larry and his wife Trudy live on a neighboring farm. Russ and Edna moved into their house in Clinton in 1979, but Russ continued to help his sons when needed. Russ liked to tinker and could fix almost anything. He was handy with a welder and was a good electrician. Russell built some of his own machinery, including a snow blower for his tractor, a tractor loader and self-unloading silage wagons. He held two patents. Russell was an active conservationist. He planted many miles of tree windbreaks and was an early adapter of reduced tillage of the soil. Russell enjoyed photography, especially in his younger days. He always kept abreast of local, national and world news. Russell loved to tell jokes and was a good story-teller. He liked chess, whist, and mind puzzlers.<br>
Russ was active in the Minnesota Farmers Union, serving as Big Stone County President for many years. He was a strong supporter of the DFL political party and once ran for the state senate. Russell valued his personal friendship with Senator Hubert Humphrey. Russell had a strong desire to preserve the local heritage of Big Stone County as a member of the Big Stone County Historical Society. A major disappointment was not getting the historic barn by Artichoke Lake moved to the Ortonville, MN museum site. Russell was a member of the Big Stone Olde Power and Machinery Club and Sons of Norway. He was a farm credit mediator in cooperation with the University of Minnesota-Morris during the farm crisis of the 1980's. Russell was a volunteer driver for Prairie Five providing rides to medical appointments for persons in need. Russell started the grassroots effort that eventually grew into Pheasants Forever, and now has chapters nationwide. Russell was on the first state board of directors of Pheasants Forever.<br>
Russ and Edna enjoyed a passion for gardening and especially flowers. They planted the church flower bed for their church. They then took classes and became Master Gardeners. After traveling into Mexico a few times, they took Spanish lessons. They then traveled throughout Mexico staying with parents of a family friend in Veracruz. They enjoyed later trips by chartered bus tours. They enjoyed travels to New England, Nova Scotia, Alaska, Georgia and other destinations. Russell enjoyed music very much and sang in the Trinity Lutheran Church Choir for many years. He insisted that all of his children take piano lessons. In his later years after Parkinson's disease made other pastimes challenging, Russ continued to find great solace in music. He calmly accepted his physical losses without complaint. Russell left a legacy of faith for his family and rarely missing a church service. He was very active with Trinity Lutheran Church where he taught Sunday School for many years. He and Edna both leave a legacy of marital love and commitment. They were constant companions and helpmates and were often seen holding hands. Russell died peacefully with his wife by his side on the afternoon of January 10, 2012 at Grace Home in Graceville. He lived to the age of 87 years.<br>
Russell is survived by his wife Edna; five children: Larry (Trudy) of Clinton, MN; Ruth Anderson of Ro-seville, MN; Carol (Anderson) Brandt of Browerville, MN; Keith (Jane) Anderson of Clinton, MN and Dori (Clark) Haliburton of Watertown, SD. He is also survived by brother Glen (Lorna) Anderson of Perham, sisters Betty (Vernon) Cohrs of Westbrook and Jeane (Frank) Buer of Canby, 14 grandchildren, 14 great-grandchildren and one great-grandchild to be born. Russell is preceded in death by his parents, brother Donald Anderson, sister Laurel Hanson and son-in-law Craig Brandt.<br>
