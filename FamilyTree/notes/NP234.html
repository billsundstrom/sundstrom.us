DIARY OF LOIS ANN (HAWKES) CASE<br>
I was born in a small house on Knights Creek Road in Scio, NY. A neighbor lady named Dolly Clark named me. Mom said she liked to put names together that matched, so that is how I got my name. I am number 7 of 9 children. I have two sisters and one brother passed away. I started school when I was six years old (1939) in a one-room school on Horse Run Road in Shinglehouse, PA. That is where we were living when my oldest brother died by drowning. I was six years old. My grandfather Hawkes died the year before. The School is now a home. We lived there for about 3 years. My teacher was Elizabeth Lunn. From there we move to the Jones house in Kibbeville, Millport, PA. We lived in another house there also, as we traded houses with the school teacher. Mary Greenhill was her name. She was a very nice person. She caught me chewing gum in school one day in class and made me stay in at recess. Another time I came down off the slide and landed on my spine and had to go home for the rest of the day. I'm not sure how long we lived there, maybe a year or two.<br>

SHINGLEHOUSE - Funeral services for Robert Lorne (Junior) Hawkes, who drowned in the Oswayo Creek Thursday afternoon, will be held at the Morton Funeral Home, Saturday at two o'clock, with Dr. J.F. Weinhauer, pastor of the First Baptist Church officiating. Burial will be in Little Genesee Cemetery.<br>
 The youth, who was born in Olean, February 22, 1921, was the son of Mr. and Mrs. Lorne G. Hawkes of Horse Run. Surviving besides his parents, are eight younger brothers and sisters, all at home. It was reported that the youth had walked out on a log from which swimmers are accustomed to dive into the pool, which is located in the creek at Babbitt Bridge, two miles southeast of Shinglehouse. Nobody was in the pool at the time, which was about one o'clock, it is said. It is believed that Hawkes fell accidentally off the log into the water. He was considered a good swimmer.<br>
 It was estimated that he was in the water from six to ten minutes. Several boys fishing near by spread the alarm and Hollis Nichols, who lived near the scene, recovered Hawkes from the water as Shinglehouse Firemen arrived. Artificial respiration was administered and Olean Firemen were telephoned before the arrival of the Morton ambulance from Shinglehouse.<br>
 A car was dispatched from the Olean Fire Department with an inhalator to meet the ambulance but through a misunderstanding they passed each other in Portville. The youth was brought to the Olean Fire Headquarters in Olean where seven members of the Department worked over him with another inhalator until three o'clock, when he was pronounced dead by Dr. C.D. Hosmer, Coroner.<br>
 Dr. F.P. Keefe of Olean and Dr. J. Emerson Dailey of Houston, visiting in Olean, administered a stimulant direct to the heart of the youth while the inhalator was being used.<br>
 Coroner Hosmer said he did not intend to hold an inquest and gave permission for removal of the body to the Morton Funeral Home at Shinglehouse. He considered the death accidental, estimated Hawkes died enroute to Olean.<br>
 Although preliminary examination of the body revealed no marks, it was thought possibly the youth had struck an object when he fell. <br>
