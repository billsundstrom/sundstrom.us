<h2>Notes</h2>
Bretislav of BOHEMIA
<p>
<a name ="I007744"><b>[I007744]</b></a><br />
Br(etislav (b. between 1005-1012, d. January 10, 1055) of the house of Premyslids was a duke of Bohemia from 1035 till 1055.<br>
<br>
Br(etislav was a son of duke Oldr(ich, then the protector of the atecko province, and his would-be wife Boena. In 1019 at Schweinfurt he kidnapped his future wife Judith of Schweinfurt (Jitka), a daughter of a Bavarian margrave, Henry of Schweinfurt of Nordgau.<br>
<br>
During his fatherʼs reign, in 1029, he took back Moravia from Poland. About 1031 Br(etislav invaded Hungary in order to prevent its expansion under king Stephen. The partition of Bohemia between Oldr(ich and his brother Jaromir in 1034 was probably the reason why Br(etislav fled beyond Bohemian border only to come back to take the throne after Jaromirʼs abdication.<br>
<br>
In 1035 Br(etislav helped Emperor Conrad II in his war against the Lusatians. In 1038 he invaded Little Poland, captured Krakow and Poznan and sacked the capital, Gniezno, bringing the relics of St Adalbert back with him. On the way back he conquered part of Silesia including Wroc?aw. His main goal was to set up an archbishopric see in Prague and create a large state subject only to the Holy Roman Empire. In 1041 the German King Henry III invaded Bohemia but was forced to retreat by an ambush on his supply lines. However, Br(etislav was aware that he could not hold out indefinitely against the Germans and signed a truce with Henry III. In the ensuing peace treaty Br(etislav renounced all of his conquests save for Moravia.<br>
<br>
In 1047 Emperor Henry III negotiated a peace treaty between Br(etislav and the Poles. This pact worked in Br(etislav's favour as the Polish ruler swore never again to attack Bohemia in return for an annual subsidy to Gniezno. In 1054 Bretislav issued the famous Seniority Law. For the first time this act stated that Bohemia and Moravia would pass directly through the senior line of the Premyslid dynasty. Younger members of the dynasty were allowed to govern Moravia, but only at the Duke's discretion.<br>
<br>
Br(etislav was the author of decrees concerning the rules of Christianization, which included a ban on polygamy or trade on holidays.<br>
<br>
Br(etislav died at Chudrim in 1055 during his preparation for another invasion of Hungary and was succeeded by his son Spytihnev II.<br>
<br>
</p>
Dubrawka of BOHEMIA
<p>
<a name ="I009147"><b>[I009147]</b></a><br />
Dubrawka of Bohemia (Polish, Dobrawa or Da;brówka, Czech Doubravka), born about 925/931 died 977. She was the daughter of duke Boleslav I of Bohemia and Adiva of England. Adiva was a daughter of King Edward the Elder of England.<br>
<br>
Dubrawka was first married to Günther von Merseburg. They had a son named Ekkehard I. Margrave Ekkehard I v. Meissen, duke of Thuringia, married Suanehild Billung and their son, margrave Hermann v. Meissen, married Regelinda or Reginlindis, a daughter of Boleslaus or Boleslaw I Chrobry.<br>
<br>
After Günther von Merseburg's death his widow Dubrawka married in 965 Mieszko I.<br>
</p>
Oldrich of BOHEMIA
<p>
<a name ="I007756"><b>[I007756]</b></a><br />
Oldrich (b.ca. 975,d. November 11, 1034), was duke of Bohemia from the Premyslid dynasty 1012-1033 and briefly 1034. Oldr(ich became duke when he deposed his brother Jaromir in 1012. Discarding his wife on the grounds that they were childless, Oldr(ich married a peasant woman known as Bozena. Oldr(ich and his son Br(etislav sought to win back Moravia from the Poles. In 1019 Br(etislav drove the Poles out of the eastern lands. Oldr(ich was deposed by the Holy Roman Emperor Conrad II in 1033,and replaced with his brother Jaromir, but he was captured, blinded and deposed by Oldr(ich,who seized power again.Oldr(ich died soon after. The later examination of his skeleton revealed that Oldr(ich's skull had suffered a fatal blow.<br>
</p>
Vratislav II of BOHEMIA
<p>
<a name ="I005541"><b>[I005541]</b></a><br />
Vratislav II (died January 14, 1092) was the first king of Bohemia.<br>
<br>
The son of Br(etislav I, Vratislav became Duke of Bohemia in 1061. Vratislav came to prominence on June 9, 1075 when he helped the German King Henry IV to crush the Saxon revolt at Homburg-on-Unstrut. A loyal ally of Henry IV, Vratislav raised an army to serve in Henry's Italian campaign of 1081. The Czechs distinguished themselves in the capture of Rome for which Vratislav was crowned King of Bohemia on June 15, 1085. Vratislav's title was not hereditary and was to be regarded as a gift of the emperor. He died in 1092 leaving his brother Konrád of Moravia as Duke only.<br>
</p>
Vratislav of BOHEMIA
<p>
<a name ="I007763"><b>[I007763]</b></a><br />
Vratislav I, Duke of Bohemia (915- February 13, 921), was the younger brother of Spytihnev I.<br>
<br>
Vratislav had two sons, Václav and Boleslav. The Chronicle of Fulda reports that in 900 the Bavarians attacked Moravia in alliance with the Bohemians. Vratislav died (possibly in 919, although 921 is more often conjectured) in battle against the Magyars.<br>
