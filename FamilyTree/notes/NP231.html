She was a former member of the Duluth Woman's Club and Duluth Junior League. <br>

Hugh Huntley HARRISON
<p>
<a name ="I003703"><b>[I003703]</b></a><br />
Hugh Huntley Harrison died peacefully in his sleep, surrounded by his children and grandchildren, on Friday, June 29th, at Tacoma Franciscan Hospice. He was 87. Hugh was born in Napa, CA on June 23, 1920 and spent most of his childhood in California and Minnesota. He served in the South Pacific during World War II as a Lieutenant in the U.S. Army. During a leave, he met his future wife and lifelong love, Jeanne, at the Olympic Hotel in downtown Seattle. He proposed to her that night, they wed three months later and they were married for 56 years until her death in 2000. After Hugh earned a B.A. in journalism at the University of Minnesota, he began working as a police and sports reporter for the Minneapolis Star Tribune, but he and Jeanne missed the Northwest. In 1950 they moved back to Seattle and never left. Hugh's career with The Seattle Time spanned five decades. He worked as a copy editor and wire news editor until he retired in 1958 to take care of his wife, who has multiple sclerosis. Hugh was also very involved in the Northwest Newspaper Guild, serving 10 years as the International Vice President, three terms as president and four terms as Administrative Officer. Hugh was instrumental in establishing a pension program for newspaper employees in the AFL-CIO. Hugh advised the U.W. Daily for several years and taught journalism at Clark College and Seattle Central Community College, where he also advised the school papers. Hugh's other love was golf. He played thousands of golf games over his lifetime on courses throughout the world. His two holes-in-one and his golf games at St. Andrews golf course were the high points of his second career. Hugh was an ace pool player, an avid fan of horseracing and a connoisseur of good beer and fine cigars. More importantly, he was a truly good man. Although his wit and his love of argument were occasionally causes of friction, his brevity was a joy. Hugh never belabored a point. Everyone who knew him trusted and respected him for his kindness and integrity. Hugh was a true liberal democrat and a champion of the underdog. Hugh is survived by his two sons, John and Mark; three daughters, Debbie (John Kinerk), Becky (Luke Giovine) and Julie (John Feeney); his brother, Hal Harrison; twelve grandchildren and eleven great-grandchildren. As Hugh requested that no formal memorial services be held, there will be a Party to honor him on August 5th at a time and place to be announced later in this column. The family asks that remembrances be made to the ACLU, 705 2nd Ave. #300, Seattle, WA 98104; MS Society, 192 Nickerson St. #100, Seattle, 98109; or Alzheimer's Association, 12721 30th Ave. N.

George Argale HARROP
<p>
<a name ="I030177"><b>[I030177]</b></a><br />
GEORGE ARGALE HARROP, JR., M.D.<br>
BY CHARLES R. AUSTRIAN, M.D.<br>
The especial charm of this Association is at once its one shortcoming, for not only does it bring together men with a common interest but, more than do most similar organizations, it welds more closely the bonds of friendship between kindred spirits. Its fostering of social exchange and of camaraderie makes harder the inevitable depletion of its roster by time, a fact emphasized anew as we note now the death of George Argale Harrop, Jr.<br>
Born in Peru, Illinois, on November 5, 1890, the son of George Argale and Mary Belle Cole Harrop, he received his preliminary education in that town, then spent two years at the University of Wisconsin (1908-10), after which he transferred to Harvard University, where he received the degree of Bachelor of Arts in 1912. Following his graduation from college, he entered the Medical School of the Johns Hopkins University and was awarded his Doctorate of Medicine in 1916. From 1916 to 1920, he served as Intern and Assistant Resident in Medicine at the Johns Hopkins Hospital, and then for the year 1920-21, was engaged in investigative work with Professor Krogh in Copenhagen. From 1921 to 1923, he was Resident Physician and Instructor in Medicine at Columbia University, and in 1923- 24 he was an Associate Professor of Medicine at Peking Union Medical College, from which post he returned to Hopkins, where he remained as Associate and then as Associate Professor of Medicine from 1925 to 1938. During those years he demonstrated, in addition to his interest in clinical medicine, an especial aptitude for research in and for the teaching of disorders of nutrition and of metabolism, published many papers and established a reputation as an outstanding investigator. His busy schedule allowed time in 1921 for a trip to Peru under the auspices of The Royal Society leading to the establishment of good contacts that he renewed in 1939 when he journeyed again to Mexico and South America.<br>
In 1938, Harrop left Baltimore and his direct affiliation with academic medicine to become Director of Research of the Squibb Institute for Medical Research at New Brunswick, N. J., a post he held until his death. In this capacity, large administrative responsibilities left him relatively little time personally to carry on investigative work and deprived him of the opportunity to conduct clinics or classes, but his wealth of information was helpful to his associates, his enthusiasm and creative capacity were stimulating to them and he directed well the fruitful labor of many colleagues in diversified fields. Arduous duties and a crowded schedule left him little time or inclination for hobbies and he found his chief relaxation and pleasure in his home with his wife, Esther Caldwell, to whom he was married in China in 1924 and with their three sons and one daughter.<br>
He belonged to many scientific societies at home and abroad, was a member of several honorary fraternities and was the recipient of many honors. He was shy but genial, and, although by nature modest and retiring, was ready at all times not merely to express but stoutly to champion his views. He was tolerant and above all else kind, with a simplicity almost unique in one so wise as he. He was gregarious, an entertaining companion, a good friend. Although hampered by imperfect health for some time, he continued stoically to carry on without stint of effort, sustained or driven by his intellectual curiosity, ambition, determination and by an energy that was not to be denied. From January, 1945, on, grave symptoms prevented continuing activity and caused the invalidism that checked him until his death on August 4 of that year.<br>
A member of this Association since 1933, his companionship was enjoyed, his friendship esteemed and his passing is recorded with sorrow. Truly, in the words of the poet "he was lost too soon." <br>

Susan Rochelle HARTENHOFF
<p>
<a name ="I026869"><b>[I026869]</b></a><br />
Susan Hartenhoff-Haygood, a self-described Midwesterner, was born in Sioux Falls, South Dakota. Her interest in art developed at an early age with influence and support from her family and her father, a plein aire painter now living in California. She spent her childhood pondering the vast landscape that surrounded her. Her love of art is matched only by her passion for horses. She remembers learning about great artists as a young child. One of her most poignant early memories is of a piece called "The Horse Fair" by Rosa Bonheur, that hung in her elementary schoolʼs hallway. It is this subject that first brought attention to her own paintings and drawings. Her love of horses was encouraged by her aunt, who helped her purchase her first horse and taught her horsemanship.<br>
She began her formal art education at South Dakota State University in Brookings, where she earned a Bachelor of Arts degree with an emphasis in printmaking. In her senior year she was honored with the Ritz-Caldwell-Young Art Scholarship. Her thirst for knowledge led her to the University of South Dakota in Vermillion where she worked towards her Master of Fine Art degree. Her talent was quickly noticed and she was awarded an apprenticeship at Echo Press, a fine art lithography press in Bloomington, Indiana. There she studied advanced lithographic techniques under the guidance of master printer David Keister and printmaker Rudy Pozzatti of Indiana University. When asked about creative influences, Susan cites printmaker Gerald Kruse. "He taught me the beauty of line and the importance of composition. But the most important thing he taught me was to create what I know and what I believe." While completing her education and in her career afterwards, she has participated in several solo exhibitions and won numerous awards. Her work can be found in private, civic, and corporate collections including the South Dakota Memorial Art Center, the Nobles County Art Center in Worthington, Minnesota, and in Donald Trumpʼs Taj Mahal in Atlantic City, New Jersey. Susan moved from the heartland of America to the center of the Western Desert in Phoenix, Arizona. "They donʼt ride horses to work, but there are bridle paths through the city, and back streets that lead to the nearby desert preserves. And the Arabian horse world revolves around Scottsdale. Itʼs been an inspiration to be so connected to nature and around such beautiful horses." Susanʼs primary source of inspiration is derived from the world of nature that surrounds her. It is natural that her work has taken on aspects of her newest influences. Susan now incorporates natural wood veneers and handmade papers into her work. Her love of the outdoors is evident in her color palette, a mix of warm neutrals with splashes of blues and greens. While she is constantly exploring new mediums, it is her affection for nature that is the driving force behind her work.<br>

Eldon was born May 10, 1920 to William and Lucy (Wittmer) Hartter at their family home northwest of Berwick, Kansas where he also attended school. Following his schooling, Eldon continued to work on the family farm and developed his skills as a mechanic working in auto garages in Sabetha and Denver, Colorado. He married Betty Jean Eisenbise of Fairview, Kansas on October 9, 1941. The couple setted in Denver where Eldon also worked in the munitions industry as World War II began. When Eldon received his call to serve his county, he enlisted in the Army Air Force, serving as a B-25 crew chief. His primary duty locations included Frederick, Oklahoma, where he trained pilots on the mechanics of their aircraft, and San Antonio, Texas, where he served as the personal crew chief for an Army Air Force Training Command General Officer. <br>
