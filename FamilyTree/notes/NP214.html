Gwenllian verch GRUFFUDD
<p>
<a name ="I009711"><b>[I009711]</b></a><br />
Gwenllian (died 1136) was the wife of Gruffydd ap Rhys, Prince of Deheubarth, and the sister of Owain Gwynedd. During a revolt which spread through south Wales in 1136, and in the absence of her husband, she led out an army against the Norman English, was defeated and killed. This has led some, rather exaggerating her historical significance, to christen her "the Welsh Boadicea". The field where the battle is believed to have taken place, close to Kidwelly Castle, is known as "Maes Gwenllian". Gwenllian's youngest son went on to become a notable leader, The Lord Rhys.<br>

Llewelyn ap GRUFFUDD
<p>
<a name ="I010538"><b>[I010538]</b></a><br />
From Wikipedia - Llywelyn the Last<br>
<br>
Llywelyn ap Gruffudd or Gruffydd (c. 1228-December 11, 1282) was the second-to-last prince of an independent Wales before its conquest by Edward I of England. In Welsh, he is remembered as Llywelyn Ein Llyw Olaf (Llywelyn, Our Last Leader).<br>
<br>
He was one of the four sons of Gruffydd, the illegitimate son of Llywelyn the Great. Opinions vary as to whether Llywelyn was the second or third son, but he was definitely not the eldest. Having fought off the opposition of his uncles and of his eldest brother, he laid claim to the principality of Gwynedd in 1258, and took the title Prince of Wales, which was then virtually a new concept. He was recognised as such by Henry III of England in the Treaty of Montgomery in 1267. However, Llywelyn's territorial ambitions gradually made him unpopular with some of the other Welsh leaders, particularly the princes of south Wales.<br>
<br>
Although a capable military leader, Llywelyn lacked the political acumen of his grandfather, and made an unnecessary enemy of King Edward I of England by continuing to ally himself with the family of Simon de Montfort even after a precarious peace with the English had been concluded. Edward took exception to Llywelyn's marriage contract with Simon's daughter, Eleanor, seized the ship carrying her from France to Wales, and kept her prisoner at Windsor until Llywelyn made certain concessions. They were eventually married at Worcester in 1278.<br>
<br>
Unusually for a Welsh prince, Llywelyn had no heirs (illegitimate sons being allowed by Welsh law to inherit), and depended on Eleanor to provide him with one. In 1282, she gave birth to a daughter, Gwenllian, but died in doing so, an event which seems to have had a serious emotional impact on Llywelyn. It was at this point that his younger brother, Dafydd, launched an attack on the English. Llywelyn felt obliged to support his brother, and a war began for which the Welsh were ill-prepared. Llywelyn's capable military leadership might still have prevailed, but he was ambushed and killed at Cilmeri, near Builth Wells, while attempting to rally support in south Wales. It was not until some time later that an English knight recognised the body as that of the prince. His head was then severed and delivered to London, where it was paraded through the streets.<br>
<br>
With the loss of Llywelyn, Welsh morale and the will to resist diminished, and Dafydd, having declared himself Llywelyn's successor, was forced to flee into the mountains. He was betrayed, captured and executed by Edward I. His wife and sons ended their lives in captivity. Llywelyn's daughter, Gwenllian, was sent to the convent of Sempringham in Lincolnshire, where she died in her fifties.<br>

Owain Gwynedd ap GRUFFUDD
<p>
<a name ="I004610"><b>[I004610]</b></a><br />
Owain Gwynedd<br>
From Wikipedia, 12 June 2006:<br>
<br>
Owain Gwynedd (in English, "Owen") (c. 1100 - November 28, 1170), alternatively known by the patronymic "Owain ap Gruffydd" and also as Owain I of Gwynedd and occasionally Owain I of Wales on account of his domination of the territory. He is considered to be the most successful of all the north Welsh princes prior to his grandson, Llywelyn the Great. He was known as Owain Gwynedd to distinguish him from another contemporary Owain ap Gruffydd, ruler of part of Powys who was known as Owain Cyfeiliog. Owain Gwynedd was a member of the House of Aberffraw, a descendant of the senior branch from Rhodri Mawr.<br>
Early life<br>
<br>
Owain's father, Gruffydd ap Cynan, was a strong and long-lived ruler who had made the principality of Gwynedd the most influential in Wales during the sixty-two years of his reign, using the island of Anglesey as his power base. His mother, Angharad ferch Owain, was the daughter of Owain ab Edwin. Owain was the second of three sons of Gruffydd and Angharad.<br>
<br>
Owain is thought to have been born on Anglesey about the year 1100. By about 1120 Gruffydd had grown too old to lead his forces in battle and Owain and his brothers Cadwallon and later Cadwaladr led the forces of Gwynedd against the Normans and against other Welsh princes with great success. His elder brother Cadwallon was killed in a battle against the forces of Powys in 1132, leaving Owain as his father's heir. Owain and Cadwaladr, in alliance with Gruffydd ap Rhys of Deheubarth, won a major victory over the Normans at Crug Mawr near Cardigan in 1136 and annexed Ceredigion to their father's realm.<br>
<br>
Accession to the throne and early campaigns<br>
<br>
On Gruffydd's death in 1137, therefore, Owain inherited a portion of a well-established kingdom, but had to share it with Cadwaladr. In 1143 Cadwaladr was implicated in the murder of Anarawd ap Gruffydd of Deheubarth, and Owain responded by sending his son Hywel ab Owain Gwynedd to strip him of his lands in the north of Ceredigion. Though Owain was later reconciled with Cadwaladr, from 1143, Owain ruled alone over most of north Wales. In 1155 Cadwaladr was driven into exile.<br>
<br>
Owain took advantage of the civil war in England between King Stephen and the Empress Matilda to push Gwynedd's boundaries further east than ever before. In 1146 he captured the castle of Mold and about 1150 captured Rhuddlan and encroached on the borders of Powys. The prince of Powys, Madog ap Maredudd, with assistance from Earl Ranulf of Chester, gave battle at Coleshill, but Owain was victorious.<br>
<br>
War with King Henry II<br>
<br>
All went well until the accession of King Henry II of England in 1154. Henry invaded Gwynedd in 1157 with the support of Madog ap Maredudd of Powys and Owain's brother Cadwaladr. The invasion met with mixed fortunes. King Henry was nearly killed in a skirmish near Basingwerk and the fleet accompanying the invasion made a landing on Anglesey where it was defeated. Owain was however forced to come to terms with Henry, being obliged to surrender Rhuddlan and other conquests in the east.<br>
<br>
Madog ap Maredudd died in 1160, enabling Owain to regain territory in the east. In 1163 he formed an alliance with Rhys ap Gruffydd of Deheubarth to challenge English rule. King Henry again invaded Gwynedd in 1165, but instead of taking the usual route along the northern coastal plain, the king's army invaded from Oswestry and took a route over the Berwyn hills. The invasion was met by an alliance of all the Welsh princes, with Owain as the undisputed leader. However there was little fighting, for the Welsh weather came to Owain's assistance as torrential rain forced Henry to retreat in disorder. The infuriated Henry mutilated a number of Welsh hostages, including two of Owain's sons.<br>
<br>
Henry did not invade Gwynedd again and Owain was able to regain his eastern conquests, recapturing Rhuddlan castle in 1167 after a siege of three months.<br>
<br>
Disputes with the church and succession<br>
<br>
The last years of Owain's life were spent in disputes with the Archbishop of Canterbury, Thomas Becket, over the appointment of a new Bishop of Bangor. When the see became vacant Owain had his nominee, Arthur of Bardsey, elected. The archbishop refused to accept this, so Owain had Arthur consecrated in Ireland. The dispute continued, and the see remained officially vacant until well after Owain's death. He was also put under pressure by the Archbishop and the Pope to put aside his second wife, Cristin, who was his first cousin, this relationship making the marriage invalid under church law. Despite being excommunicated for his defiance, Owain steadfastly refused to put Cristin aside. Owain died in 1170, and despite having been excommunicated was buried in Bangor Cathedral by the local clergy. The annalist writing Brut y Tywysogion recorded his death "after innumerable victories, and unconquered from his youth".<br>
<br>
He is believed to have commissioned the propaganda text, The Life of Gruffydd ap Cynan an account of his father's life. Following his death, civil war broke out between his sons. Owain was married twice, first to Gwladus ferch Llywarch ap Trahaearn, by whom he had two sons, Maelgwn ab Owain Gwynedd and Iorwerth Drwyndwn, the father of Llywelyn the Great, then to Cristin, by whom he had three sons including Dafydd ab Owain Gwynedd and Rhodri ab Owain Gwynedd. He also had a number of illegitimate sons, who by Welsh law had an equal claim on the inheritance if acknowledged by their father.<br>
<br>
Heirs & Successors<br>
<br>
Owain had originally designated Rhun ab Owain Gwynedd as his successor. Rhun was Owain's favourite son, and his premature death in 1147 plunged his father into a deep melancholy, from which he was only roused by the news that his forces had captured Mold castle. Owain then designated Hywel ab Owain Gwynedd as his successor, but after his death Hywel was first driven to seek refuge in Ireland by Cristin's sons, Dafydd and Rhodri, then killed at the battle of Pentraeth when he returned with an Irish army. Dafydd and Rhodri split Gwynedd between them, but a generation passed before Gwynedd was restored to its former glory under Owain's grandson Llywelyn the Great.<br>
<br>
According to legend, one of Owain's sons was Prince Madoc, who is popularly supposed to have fled across the Atlantic and colonised America. Altogether the prodigeous Owain Gwynedd is said to have had the following children from two wives and at least four mistresses:<br>
<br>
    * Rhun ab Owain Gwynedd (illegitimate)<br>
    * Hywel ab Owain Gwynedd (illegitimate)<br>
    * Iorwerth ab Owain Gwynedd (from first wife Gwladys ferch Llywarch)<br>
    * Maelgwn ab Owain Gwynedd, Lord of Ynys Môn<br>

    * Dafydd ab Owain Gwynedd (from second wife Cristina ferch Gronw)<br>

    * Cynwrig ab Owain Gwynedd (illegitimate)<br>

Rhys ap GRUFFUDD
<p>
<a name ="I009984"><b>[I009984]</b></a><br />
From Wikipedia<br>
<br>
Rhys ap Gruffydd (1132-1197) was the ruler of the kingdom of Deheubarth (South Wales) from 1155 until his death. Rhys was one of the more successful and powerful Welsh princes, but even he was forced to acknowledge English supremacy, and did so by accepting the title of "Lord" rather than "Prince" or "King", becoming The Lord Rhys (in Welsh, "Yr Arglwydd Rhys").<br>
<br>
Rhys was the youngest son of Gruffydd ap Rhys, a prince of Deheubarth, and of Gwenllian, a sister of Owain Gwynedd. He was probably born in Ireland. Both his parents died when he was around four years old, Gwenllian as a result of leading her husband's army into battle in his absence, Gruffydd himself on his return. He was brother to Anarawd, Cadell, Maredudd. After the death of their father in 1137, all four brothers ruled and worked to expand the kingdom and raid neighbour ing princes. By 1155, following the death (Anarawd (1143) and Maredudd (1155)) or disablement (Cadell) of his brothers he became sole ruler of the kingdom. About this time, he built Aberdyfi Castle. As ruler, he proceeded to challenge the new king of England, Henry II (reigned 1154-1189). Having successfully held out against Henry for a year or two, Rhys was defeated and most of his territory was taken from him. This was the point at which he agreed to pay homage to Henry, and peace temporarily reigned.<br>
<br>
In 1162, Rhys took advantage of Henry's absence in Normandy to attempt to recover some of his lost lands. This resulted once again in defeat, following which Rhys was taken to England as a prisoner. Once released, however, he went back to his old defiant ways. Henry, preoccupied with domestic problems, could not respond effectively, and the failure of the English troops in Wales and troubles in England helped Rhys to prosper. After the death of Owain Gwynedd in 1170 he was acknowledged leader of the Welsh princes and called himself "Prince of South Wales".<br>
<br>
In 1171 he signed a pact with Henry II and helped the king suppress the rebellion of 1173-74. After Henry's death, Rhys was again active, revolting against Richard I and deeply involved in internal Welsh feuds. Rhys found it difficult to maintain his position, and was obliged to enter into a protracted struggle against the Norman lord, William de Braose. He died peacefully, an old man at the peak of his power, in 1197.<br>
<br>
He was succeeded by Gruffydd ap Rhys.<br>

<a name ="I102447"><b>[I102447]</b></a><br />
Jim Grumann, age 87 died Tuesday, March 13, 2012, at St. Vincent Hospital in Green Bay. <br>
Jim was born October 23, 1924 in Two Rivers, son of the late Stephen and Leona (Simonis) Grumann. He attended St. Lukeʼs School and later Washington High School.
