Haydn Herbert MURRAY
<p>
<a name ="I072204"><b>[I072204]</b></a><br />
BLOOMINGTON - Dr. Haydn H. Murray , world-renowned geologist and longtime professor of geology at Indiana University, died on February 4, 2015. He was born in Kewanee, Illinois on August 31, 1924 to Ardis and Herbert Murray . He was preceded in death by his parents and his brother Winston Murray . He attended a one-room school for eight years and graduated from Toulon High School third in his class. He was the state clarinet high school champion and was a three-letter athlete. He dated his high school sweetheart, Juanita Appenheimer, from the first high school dance. He attended the University of Minnesota before leaving to serve in the Army Corps of Engineers. He served in the South Pacific in New Guinea and the Philippines. He and Juanita were married in 1944 and they celebrated their 70th wedding anniversary in December 2014. Upon his return from serving his country, Haydn attended the University of Illinois, where he earned his bachelor's, master's and Ph. D in geology, specializing in clay mineralogy. In 1951, he became an associate professor and a clay mineralogist for the Indiana Geological Survey at Indiana University. In 1957, Haydn left Indiana University to enter industry as director of research for Georgia Kaolin Company in New Jersey. <br>
At Georgia Kaolin Company, Dr. Murray held several positions: vice president; chief operating officer and finally executive vice president. In 1973, when the owner of Georgia Kaolin died and the company was sold, Haydn was asked to return to Indiana University as chairman of the geology department, a position he was happy to accept. He remained at Indiana University until he retired at age 70.<br>
During his time at Indiana University, Dr. Murray received numerous awards, published 170 articles, obtained three patents, wrote the book Applied Clay Minerals and was a lead editor of the book Kaolin Genesis and Utilization. He consulted for many companies in 54 countries, so he and Juanita travelled the world extensively. He was asked by the National Research Council Office of International Affairs to be an expert consultant for AID for International Development Project in Egypt to evaluate bentonite clays. Between 1983 and 1986, he made several trips to Egypt, which resulted in a new industry to produce drilling muds and foundry clays for Egypt and other Middle Eastern countries. <br>
At Indiana University, Dr. Murray advised 68 graduate students and was a member of 60 thesis committees. He received the Lifetime Achievement Award by Professional Geologists of Indiana, honorary doctor of science degree from Indiana University in 2004, and the Alumni Achievement Award from the department of geology at the University of Illinois in 2004. Other important achievements included president of the Clay Mineral Society, president of the Ceramic Association of New Jersey, member of the Board of Directors for the University of Illinois Alumni Association, speaker of the year at the Indiana Academy of Science, Distinguished Service Award at Indiana University, president of the International Clay Minerals Association, President's Thomas Hart Benton Medal for Distinguished Service to Indiana University, Indiana University Alumni Association Orwig Medal for Distinguished Service to Indiana University Athletics, and an Honorary Doctorate from the Universidad Nacional del Sur. Most notably, Dr. Murray was inducted into the National Academy of Engineers. He was also elected as the faculty representative for athletics to the Big Ten Conference and the NCAA, a position that he enjoyed very much. <br>
During his lifetime, Haydn worked hard, had a great sense of humor and was very considerate of others. His ability to connect with everyone he met or interacted with, from fishing guides, laborers, peers or high-level foreign dignitaries, resulted in everyone holding him in high esteem. In addition to traveling the world, often with his wife Juanita, he spent time with his family, enjoying golfing, reunions, card games, reading, fishing and hunting. During the late 1960's until the late 1980's, Haydn and Juanita spent as much time as they were able in St. Croix. In later years, he and Juanita spent winters in Bonita Springs, Florida. He will be remembered with love by his wife Juanita; their three children, Steven Murray (Nancy) of Houston, Texas, Marilyn Elder (Andy) of Zionsville, Indiana and Lisa Rotskoff (Peter) of Springfield, Illinois; and his grandchildren Samantha Murray , Mark Murray (Gretchen), Reed Elder, Blake Elder (Melissa), Case Elder, Grant Rotskoff; and great grandchildren, Haydn Murray , Zane Murray and Madison Elder and his many friends.<br>
A memorial service will be held at 2 p.m. on Saturday, Feb. 21, in the Tudor Room at the Indiana Memorial Union, 900 E. Seventh St, Bloomington, IN 47405. <br>
Memorial contributions may be made to the Clay Mineral Society, 3635 Concorde Parkway, Suite 500, Chantilly, VA 20151 or to the Alzheimer's Foundation of America, 322 Eighth Ave., 7th fl. New York, N.Y. 10001. <br>
