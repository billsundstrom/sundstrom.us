<a name ="I087594"><b>[I087594]</b></a><br />
Thomas H. Arters, 77, of Lodi, comfortably passed away at his home after a lengthy period of declining health on Friday, June 10, 2016. He was born September 7, 1938 in Lodi to Albert and Dorothy (Clapp) Arters and grew up on the family farm in Chatham.<br>
He graduated from Lodi High School in 1956 and served with the U. S. Army from 1958 to 1962.<br>
Tom was employed at C.W. Sommers GM Dealership in Lodi for over 30 years and was well known around town as the "go to" mechanic if you had car troubles. He spent many nights and weekends in his own garage fixing friends vehicles or maybe just spending quality time with them. He later worked for All States Electric which showcased his electrical knowledge that rivaled his mechanical abilities. He retired in 2000 and very much enjoyed the earned rewards of years of hard work.<br>
He was an avid euchre player and a member of the Lodi American Legion. Some of his proudest moments occurred at Strike & Spare Lanes in Lodi.

He had a lot of nicknames but he was most affectionately known as "Smiling Tom" a title he could not deny. Over the years, he was a mentor and a role-model to many young family friends and was always there with love and support for his family whom he cared for deeply.<br>
Surviving are his wife, Judith (nee Decker), to whom he married on August 2, 1964; sons, Kevin (Lisa) Arters of Creston, Greg (Emily) Arters of Rittman; grandchildren, Joseph, Korey, Kirsten, Kathryn, Kelsey and Austin; siblings, Helen Streett, Jack Arters, Bob (Loretta) Arters, Zeke Arters, Mary Norton, Dorothy Cutler; brother-in-law, Harold Simmons.<br>

William Ray ARTERS
<p>
<a name ="I087574"><b>[I087574]</b></a><br />
"Known by everyone who knew him as 'Doc,' Cochise County has lost a beloved friend. <br>
William 'Bill' Arters, a long-time veterinarian who started a practice in Benson sometime in the late 1960s died on Dec. 6, 2013. <br>
His quick humor, willingness to help others and passion for animals are attributes that have endeared him to all who knew him.<br>
'Doc was always very generous, kind and compassionate,' said Larry Dempster, a rancher and local business owner who has known Arters from the time he started practicing in the area. "He had an understanding for the emotional attachment that people form with their animals and was compassionate when animals died or had to be put to sleep. And he was always willing to help a friend.'<br>
Dempster said about five months ago, Arters asked him to write a book about his life. 'When I told him I would be interviewing the people who know him, he thought about it and called me back with, ʻI'm not sure I want those stories in my book. I think I'll pass on the book,' ' Dempster laughed. 'He was a character with a great sense of humor. He is going to be missed.'<br>
Jim Bradford has lived in St. David for 37 years and says he has known Arters from the time he moved to the area. "He was my veterinarian when I used to team rope," Bradford said. "He was a good man and treated people great. He also was commander of the VFW Post in Benson and was in the honor guard because of his service in the Air Force. He was very community involved and dearly loved by all who knew him."<br>
Joyce Zink, a former Arabian horse owner, who has known Arters since the late 1960s, said 'My horses were his patients when he first came to Arizona from Utah sometime around 1967 or ʻ68,' she said. 'I'm basing that on the age of an Arabian mare that I had at the time, a horse that he treated for me on his first visit at our place. He joked that he was afraid to touch her because she was the first Arab he had ever treated and he knew I had paid a lot of money for her.'<br>
Zink, who lived in Whetstone said, 'He and his wife joined us for dinner that night and he became our friend and veterinarian for all those years afterwards. Once he opened his practice in Benson, he took care of all our animals, not only the horses, but our dogs and cats as well.'<br>
Full of stories about Arters and his compassion for the animals he treated, Zink spoke of an especially long night where Arters stayed in a foaling stall with her as he helped a struggling mare with a difficult birth. 'We lost the foal that night, but saved the mare. I remember how sorry he was about the foal, but there was nothing he could do. He was a caring, terrific vet.'<br>
And the stories go on. 'We moved to the area from Germany in 1966 and met Doc Arters sometime around 1968,' recalls Connie Schlosser, another Whetstone resident whose children had dogs and horses and were active in different 4-H projects. 'I remember he was always there for us, no matter when we needed him. He was an excellent vet; very patient and caring and an amazing surgeon. He could sew up a nasty cut and it never left a scar. He constantly amazed me.'<br>
St. David resident Don Goodman has owned horses his entire life and Arters was always his vet. "Even after he retired, he was willing to give advice and help out whenever you needed him. He was always known for his generosity and willingness to help. He did a lot of volunteer work with the VFW and was known for his community service. Doc was number one in my book. He is a friend of the community's and will be sorely missed.<br>
Mahlon MacKenzie praised Arters as a friend and veterinarian, as well as commented on his compassion for others. 'Some folks got together and had a service for him out at (Mike) Robertson's place on Sunday and the one key point that was made over and over was that he was a very generous person,' said MacKenzie. 'Doc Arters was not only an excellent vet, but he would always undercharge for the services he provided. He is going to be missed by so many people in this community.'<br>
According to Mary Norton, Arters' sister, William Ray Arters was born on Feb. 9, 1932 in Chatham, Ohio, 30 miles southwest of Cleveland. He attended Chatham High School where he was a gifted athlete, lettering in baseball, football and basketball. He graduated from high school in 1950 and enlisted in the U.S. Air Force in 1951. Arters was a member of the Medevac Unit of the 374th Troop Carrier based out of Japan during the Korean War and served four years in the military. During his service, he was injured while administering medical treatment to wounded U.S. ground troops in North Korea. <br>
After leaving the air force, Arters enrolled in Ohio State University where he earned a degree in veterinary medicine in 1963. His ceaseless, compassionate and often "pro bono" veterinary care at the Arters Veterinary Clinic in Benson was the source of admiration and respect of all who knew him.<br>
Affectionately known in the community as 'Doc,' he is survived by his sons, Daniel (Kristine) of Nampa, Idaho; Zane (Karen) of Queen Creek, Ariz.; Shane (Heather) of Morristown, NJ; daughter, Sherri Franklin of Surprise, Ariz.; thirteen grandchildren and three great-grandchildren.<br>
He also is survived by sisters Helen Streett of Medina, Ohio, Mary Norton of Arden, N.C. and Dorothy Cutler of Salt Lake City, Utah and brothers Jack of Murfeesboro, Tenn; Robert and Norman of Chatham, Ohio and Tom of Lodi, Ohio, as well as many nieces and nephews.<br>
'My brother was always a very caring, giving individual that had so much compassion for animals and people even up until the end of his life,' said Norton. 'I just loved Doc and will always miss him.'" <br>
