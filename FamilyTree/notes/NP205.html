<a name ="I105105"><b>[I105105]</b></a><br />
A disease of the bowels, the beginning of which came while he was serving in the war for the Union, resulted yesterday morning in the death of Col. James S. Goodrich, the well and widely known newspaper man. Col. Goodrich was the son of Rev. Joshua Goodrich and died at his father's residence, 146 Perrine street, in this city. He was born in Auburn forty-four years ago, received an academic education and began his experience in a newspaper office about 1857, when he became an Advertiser apprentice. At the beginning of the rebellion he, a mere lad, went out with the 75th regiment, became shortly after a sergeant in his company, and later obtained a commission as captain in the 19th U.S. Infantry, composed of colored troops. In 1864 he was put over the commissary department at Mobile and the close of the war found him commanding a battery of heavy artillery at Port Hatteras. His newspaper work was resumed in the Auburn Morning News office, after a brief service with the Merchant's Express Co. The Syracuse Courier, Standard, Oswego Times, and Syracuse Herald subsequently received his efforts and 1882 found him again in Auburn, editor of the Evening Dispatch, where he remained nearly two years. As editor and part proprietor of the Syracuse Sunday Times he finished his regular newspaper career, and since last fall he has been fighting the fatal disease which made continual and persistent inroads upon his life.<br>
Col. Goodrich was a Republican in politics and a sturdy adherent of the party and its principles. His religious connections were with the church of the Disciples and he was a member of Christ church, in Syracuse. He was conscientious and upright in all his relations as a journalist, a soldier and a citizen and leaves behind him a record of good things done for this world. He leaves a wife, children and many friends to mourn his death. His funeral will take place form his home in Fayette street, Syracuse, at 2 p.m. tomorrow. His remains were taken to the salt city today.<br>

</p>
Robert Coningsby GORDON
<p>
<a name ="I029872"><b>[I029872]</b></a><br />
Robert Coningsby Gordon died on July 17 at the age of ninety-one.<br>
He was born on October 29, 1921 in Melbourne, Australia. Shortly after, his family immigrated to Norfolk, Virginia, where his father served as minister for the United Church of Christ.<br>
Mr. Gordon grew up as an accomplished classical pianist and majored in music at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill. Thoughts of a concert career were cut short by Pearl Harbor. Gordon volunteered for the Navy, attended officerʼs training school, and served as Lieutenant J G on the S.S. Helena and, later the S.S. Quincy. The Helena was sunk, with much loss of life, during the Battle of the Solomon Islands. After being rescued from an enemy-held island, he returned briefly to the states and married Jean Swan on December 2, 1943. This December would have marked the coupleʼs seventieth anniversary.<br>
During his tour of duty on the Quincy, he participated as gunnery officer in the D-Day naval bombardment of German defenses at Omaha Beach. The Quincy then sailed to join in the Mediterranean campaign and, later, to the Pacific, where it was in the flotilla present at the Japanese surrender.<br>
Thanks to the G.I. Bill of Rights, Gordon was able to move to Cambridge, Massachusetts with his family (his wife, their son John , and soon a daughter, Jean Craigie) to earn a Ph.D in English Literature from Harvard University. The family then drove across country to Eugene, Oregon, where he took his first teaching job in the English Department of the University of Oregon. While in Eugene he became a naturalized citizen of the United States. A second son, Alan, was born in 1952.<br>
In 1957 he accepted a position in the Humanities Department at San Jose State University, in California. The family moved to a hillside home in Los Gatos, California, overlooking the Santa Clara Valley - at the time an area of orchards and tract homes, but soon to become known as Silicon Valley. As an internationally recognized scholar on Sir Walter Scott, he spent two years with his family in Edinburgh, Scotland on a Fulbright grant.<br>
In 1987 he retired and moved with his wife to Old Lyme, Connecticut. The two were enthusiastic participants in the First Congregational Church of Old Lyme. Most years they summered at their house in East Boothbay, to which Mrs. Gordon had family ties reaching back to the nineteenth century.<br>
Mr. Gordon continued his life-long involvement in music, singing in the church choir and attending every concert and opera he could. Despite the increasing infirmities of age, he also maintained his activities in literature. His last book, "Arms and the Imagination,"was scrupulously researched and expertly written with the help of magnifying glass and reading machine; it was published when the author was 88. He also continued to be engaged in political causes. In particular, having experienced the extreme violence of the war years, he campaigned until his last days for American gun control laws.<br>
He was predeceased by his daughter, Jean Craigie Gordon, and by his wife, Jean Swan Gordon, whose death occurred less than three months before his.<br>
He is survived by his sons, John Gordon and Alan Gordon; grandchildren, Jonathan Gordon, Ashley Gordon, and Sasha (Alexandra) Gordon, and a great-granddaughter, Laurel Gordon.<br>
A Memorial Service will be held at 3 p.m. on August 3, at the First Congregational Church of Old Lyme.<br>
Donations should be made to the James Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence: www.bradycampaign.org.<br>
