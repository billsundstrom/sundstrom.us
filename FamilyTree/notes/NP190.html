 FREDEGUND
<p>
<a name ="I010066"><b>[I010066]</b></a><br />
Fredegund, or Frédégonde, (d. 597) was the Queen consort of Chilperic I, the Merovingian Frankish king of Soissons.<br>
<br>
Originally a servant, Fredegund became Chilperic's mistress after he had murdered his wife and queen, Galswintha (c. 568). But Galswintha's sister, Brunhilda, in revenge against Chilperic, began a feud which lasted more than 40 years.<br>
<br>
Fredegund is said to be responsible for the assassination of Sigebert I in 575 and made attempts on the lives of Guntram (her brother-in-law and the king of Burgundy), Childebert II (Sigebert's son), and Brunhilda.<br>
<br>
After the mysterious assassination of Chilperic (584), Fredegund seized his riches and took refuge in the cathedral at Paris. Both she and her surviving son, Clotaire II, were protected by Guntram until he died in 592.<br>
<br>
Said to be ruthlessly murderous and sadistically cruel, Fredegund perhaps has few rivals in monstrousness. And although she did not live to see it, her son's execution of Brunhilda bore the mark of Fredegund's hatred: Clotaire had the old queen, now in her sixties, stretched in agony upon the rack for three entire days, then watched her meet her death chained between four horses that were goaded to the four points of the compass, tearing her body asunder.<br>

<p>
<a name ="I040799"><b>[I040799]</b></a><br />
Larry Raymond Freeman, 69, went to the Lord on January 8, 2016. <br>
Larry was born on Nov. 22, 1946 in Sturgis, SD to Raymond E. and Jesse "June" Freeman. He spent his childhood in the Union Center/White Owl area and attended the local grade school.  He attended high school in New Underwood, SD and joined the U.S. Army after graduation.  He served his country with honor and returned home to study architecture at S.D.S.M. & T. <br>
On April 20, 1968 he married Lindell J. Carstensen and they moved to Minnesota in 1970. They returned to Rapid City in 1971 and lived there until 1973.  Larry and Lindell began their ranching life in 1973 just south of Enning, SD, where they raised two children, Heath and Kara.  In 1991, the family moved to Owanka, SD.  Larry was a rancher at heart but also did trucking, construction, and maintenance. <br>
Larry was a dedicated, loving father and husband who always enjoyed teaching and coaching the community kids. He was a humble, smart, creative man who loved to tell stories and make people laugh.  His determination and desire to work hard were obvious to anyone who met him.  He was always willing to lend a hand and never turned down an opportunity to make a friend.  His laugh, ability to fix anything, and unique culinary skills, among a million other characteristics, will be missed more than words can express.  He is at peace now and resting in the hands of the Lord, for that we are thankful.  He was a true blessing to his family and friends who will continue to cherish the good times, special memories, and the lessons he taught us all. <br>
He was preceded in death by his father, Raymond E. Freeman, and his brother, Clifford J. Freeman.<br>
