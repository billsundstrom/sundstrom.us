Alline Margaret SAILOR
<p>
<a name ="I011526"><b>[I011526]</b></a><br />
Alline Margaret Huycke, age 81, of 1255 West 18th St., Oshkosh, where she has resided for the past six years, entered into eternal rest on Monday, Feb. 14, 2005 at the Mercy Medical Center in Oshkosh, from complications of a stroke.<br>
Mass of Christian Burial will be held at 11 a.m. on Friday, Feb. 18, 2005 at Holy Cross Catholic Church in Mishicot, with the Rev. Paul Paider officiating. Burial will follow in the Holy Cross Cemetery in Two Rivers.<br>
Alline was born June 27, 1923 in St. Paul, Minn., to the late Aloys and Marion Bailey Sailor. She served in the United States Navy during World War II as a WAVE in Washington, D.C., and later completed her bachelor's degree in education. She married Albert Raymond Huycke on Sept. 15, 1956.<br>
She is survived by one daughter: Judy (Joseph) Hoffmann of Oshkosh; four sons: Jon (Marilyn) Huycke of California; James (Christine) Huycke of Racine; Joseph (Gail) Huycke of Phillips, Wis.; Jeffery Huycke of Mishicot; and by nine grandchildren; one great-grandchild; and a sister: Marilyn (Ralph) Rolland of Lake Carlos, Minn. In addition to her parents, she was also preceded in death by her husband, Albert in 1984.<br>
Relatives and friends may call after 9:30 a.m. on Friday at Holy Cross Catholic Church in Mishicot, until the time of service at 11 a.m. There will be no Thursday evening visitation.<br>
The Lambert-Eckert Funeral Home of Mishicot is assisting the Huycke family with funeral arrangements.<br>
Alline exhaled her last breath on Earth on Valentine's Day, to the final cords of Mozart's "Sonata in A Major" and moved with the same grace in which she lived her life into the arms of God. Unable to speak due to a stroke, she prayed intensely with her eyes on the cross as a rosary was said that morning. To her children she leaves a great legacy of the love of God, a deep and intimate appreciation of the earth without an attachment to weigh her soul, an immersion in the arts and philosophy, and in all that is good in humanity through God.<br>
Born the second daughter to the circulation editor of the St. Paul Dispatch, she was well-educated and experienced the Roaring '20s through her parents' enjoyment of that easy life, until The Great Depression struck her family with the same devastation that it struck most others. A survivor of polio as a child and an A student, Alline was prepared to endure the hardships. With her maiden name, Sailor, she enlisted in the Navy during World War II, and an article on the front page of the Dispatch announced with a twinkle, "A Sailor Joins the Navy." She was honorably discharged after the war, but took with her the seeds of tuberculosis, resulting in two years of bed-rest for recovery. She attended college with some studies in Fribourg, Switzerland, and achieved a degree in education. When Alline's friend Helen, who has shared the TB experience, died after childbirth, Alline visited Helen's widower, Albert, and a romance led quickly to marriage. The sophisticated city woman moved with Albert to an isolated country spot on a river north of Mishicot, and four more children were added to the family. Alline immersed herself in child-raising and vegetable-raising and entwined in her children's lives the beauty of the humanities and that of nature. She volunteered with the elderly and infirm, and stayed active in local educational and community issues. After Albert's death, Post-Polio Syndrome slowed down her body, but her compassionate interactions with the world continued throughout her life. She truly cultured and cultivated, and her garden grows on. Our friend, our mentor, our mother, we will miss you greatly.<br>

<br>
Autobiography:<br>
I suppose a biography should begin at the begining, but my childhood was comparatively uneventful, and I will just briefly touch on those things which may have affected my present attitudes.<br>
Serious illness seems to have had a profound effect on my life.  Although I have had only minimal use for doctors for the greater part of my life, I did have two illnesses involving hospitalization.  First was a brief, and thankfully very light acquaintance with polio.  because of the epidemic then (early thirties), the doctor recognized the early symptoms, and I was given a serum that, though experimental, apparantly did keep me from permanent paralysis.  This was my first experience with a fairly long period of bed rest.  The second illness was much later.<br>
Moving from the neighborhood we had grown to love at the time I was begining the seventh grade was a somewhat traumatic experience because it caused a severing of close friendships.  I remained in the same school because it was a parochial school, and I had only two years to complete, but htere was no after school contact with my friends, and I began a prolonged aquaintance with loneliness.  This was not althogether bad because it enabled me to develop a habit of independent thinking and a love of reading.  Summers brought the delightful relief of weeks in the country visiting grandparents and great-grandparents on their farms, and two wonderful weeks a a lake resort fishing and swimming.  My love of country began then, and my favorite daydream was owning a home in the country.<br>
Another traumatic experience which acquainted me with the tensions experienced by the poor was my father's loss of job during the summer between my sophomore and junior years of high school.  My values were in for a sudden shock.  We had always been financially secure, but the consolidation od newspapers in the area at this time caused many newspaper executives to be out of work, and it was impossible for my father to botain another position in the only field ha had ever known.  I did not reurn to school in the fall, but tried to find some kind of work to help bring in at least a trickle of money.  I sonn found that the only kind of work I could get was housework and baby-sitting.  I did that until the gegingin of the second semester, when my sister, who had graduated that same year, spoke to the sisters at the academy and arrainged for me to work after school to pay my tuition.  I returned to school and doubled up on some classes to make up for the semester I had missed .  I had a new appreciation for education and graduated Magna Cum Laude.  I learned that things that come to us without effort are never appreciated.<br>
Since I graduated in 1941, the war soon affected my life.  I had not planned to enlist, but was working in an office across the street from a recruiting office and was talked into stopping in there on a lunch hour with a friend who wanted to find out about the Navy.  When they learned my name (my maiden name is Sailor), they wouldn't give up on me until I had enlisted.  Two and one-half years as a W.A.V.E. in Washington, D.C. followed.<br>
This part of my life was an education in meeting people of varied backgrounds and an opportunity to travel along the east coast.  I also learned a bit about helping people at times of stress.  As Yeoman in charge of the leave and liberty section of a very large station, I had to process emergency leaves and report the daily muster (attendance), among other duties.  This brought me into contact with those experienceing death in the family and other stresses whish caused some to go AWOL.  I took care of Red Cross investigations and arranged priority transportation.  Sometimes I had to say no when the emergency did not involve a member of the immediate family, but often I would fight with Naval Barracks to obatin leave in caes that seemed exceptional, such as a grandmother who was like a mother to the person applying, or, as in one case, a fiance of a WAVE officer who was merely asking to take leave and apply it the nesxt year's leave.  I learned to deal with bureaucracy and to  ascertain the fake from the real.<br>
<br>
After the war came my second bout with serious illness.  My x-ray at the time of discharge showed suspicious shadows, which on further examination was determined to be tuberculosis.  Since theis was before the time of drugs which are now used, I entered a sanatorium for the "rest cure".  Both lungs were involved, though minimally, and surgery was not considered.  before long it was obvious I could rest as well at home, and there followed two years of complete bed rest at my mother's home.  Luckily I did not know at the time that it would take that long or I might have experienced considerable depression.  As it was, each month after my monthly check-up, I hoped to hear the doctor say, "You can start getting up now."  But it was to be a total of two and one-half years before he said that.  And then the getting up was very gradual:  Meals first, one at a time, then walks, five minutes twice a day increasing by five minutes each week until I had attained an hour twice a day .  I was ready for the world again.   Oddly enough, I never felt these years were wasted.  I read a lot, knitted and crocheted, listened to debates on the radio (no TV in those days), and prayed.  A good part of my reading was on the subject of health.  Once you are that sick, you make up your mind it isn't going to happen again.<br>
<br>
College followed:  two years at St. Teresa's in Winona, asummer session at the University of Fribourg, Switzerland, and two years at St. Cloud State Teachers College.  The last two years I regretted.  I received excellent grades but I learned very little.  The classes were sheer boredom--too many methods courses.  My ambition is to take more courses in the subjects I really enjoy:  philosophy, English, foreign languages, history.  History?  How strange.  In high school I hated it.<br>
<br>
So I had a B.S. in education and a teacher's certificate, but did I teach?  Oh, no.  I returned to secretarila work.  I became a job hopper, finally ending up as Research Asssistant to the General Manager of Group Health.  Along about then I met the man who would become my husband and changed my career objective.  I becam a homemaker and loved it, though heaven knows, it wasn't easy.  I was 33 and knew very little about cooking, housekeeping, or children.  I had to learn fast because my husband was a widower with a two and a half year old child.  On our first wedding anniversary I went to the hospital and delivered a seven pound boy.  We were both delighted, bcause at my age I was a little afraid I might be too old to have children, and now little Jon had a brother!  I needn't have worried; two more boys followed in quick succession, then a finally a girl.  We had moved to the country in the second year of our marriage, and had many happy years with the house full of no ise, confusion, love and hard work.<br>
After the children were all out of high school, I took a part-time secretarial job, but after three years the business collapsed and I was nearing sixty and looking for work at a time when the unemployment rate was skyrocketing.  Since then I have worked on a few temporary jobs, but did not look for anything permanent because of my husband's health.  He had sustained s serious heart attack two years ago, and this past June died after about three months of serious illness and much suffering.<br>
I am pleased with this opportunity to do volunteer work of such significance.   After my bout with tuberculosis, I had spent some time in Legion of Mary work and part of that work was calling on shut-ins, many of whom were elderly.  I was shocked to find old people unable to get out and no one coming to visit them.  I do hope we will be able to make a significant contribution to meeting the needs of these people.<br>
  She resided 1255 West 18th Avenue, Oshkosh, Wisconsin on 23 Oct 2003 in Oshkosh, Winnebago County, Wisconsin.  She died on 14 Feb 2005 in Oshkosh, Winnebago County, Wisconsin.<br>

From 1986 until 1989 they made their home in St. Helens, Ore., where he was the pastor at Calvary Lutheran Church. They then returned to McIntosh where he was CRM. They moved to Warren, Minn., where he served both Immanuel and Zion Lutheran congregations before moving to Twin Valley, Minn. They made their home in Twin Valley for the next eight years while Arvid was the pastor at Trinity Lutheran Church. <br>
After his retirement in early 2001, they moved to a hobby farm east of Mahnomen. When the congregations of Bethlehem Lutheran Church in Mahnomen and St. John's Lutheran Church, rural Ada, were in need of a pastor, Arvid was asked to fill in until a full-time pastor could be found. Arvid served as their pastor for the past 10 years and was pastor for both churches at the time of his death. <br>
When time permitted Arvid enjoyed hunting, fishing, gardening, cooking and baking. He was an avid reader and always loved spending time with his family and when they would go on family vacations. In 2010, Arvid and Lori went to Haiti on a Lutheran mission trip where he taught and enjoyed the time spent there. His family and friends will always have fond memories of Arvid and his well-used coffee cup wherever he went and how much he loved ice cream. <br>
Arvid is survived by his wife Lori of Mahnomen; son Andrew Michael (Melissa) Salvhus of Laporte; daughters Carol Salvhus of Detroit Lakes and Heidi (Chris) Yost of Ada; eight grandchildren; brothers David (Sandy) Salvhus and Daniel (Mary) Salvhus , all of McIntosh; sister Marilyn Hamre of McIntosh: brother-in-law Glen Brua of McIntosh; and many nieces and nephews. <br>
He was preceded in death by his parents; sister Joanne Brua; brother-in-law Leighton Hamre; and nephew Kevin Hamre. <br>

Arrangements are with the Anderson Funeral Home, Twin Valley, Minn.<br>
