Artist Dies<br>
MRS. HENRY LALK DIES WEDNESDAY<br>
Was Famous Artist in Oils; Funeral Service Saturday<br>
Mrs. Henry Lalk, 48, well known Wisconsin artist died at her home on route 2, at 5:40 p.m. Wednesday.<br>
Formerly Millie Rose Brinker, she was born March 5, 1895, in Iowa and was married to Henry Lalk on Sept. 6, 1916, at Janesville.  Practically all of her married life was spent in this community.<br>
She was a member of the Christian Science society and a member of the Pythian Sisters.<br>
The Christian Science funeral service will be read by Harold Kafer at 2 p.m. Saturday in the Downing funeral chapel.  Interment will be in Evergreen cemetery.  Friends may call at the chapel Friday.<br>
Famous for Paintings<br>
Mrs. Lalk gained considerable fame for her oil paintings, particularly her rural landscapes, which she was invited to exhibit at many art shows, including those in Chicago, Springfield, IL, Beloit college, the Memorial Union art exhibit at the University of Wisconsin, and the Madison Art association. One of her oil paintings called "Our Farm in Wisconsin Landscape with Lake Koshkonong in the Distance" is now on exhibit at the Springfield museum.<br>
Last fall Mrs. Lalk was especially honored when she was asked to exhibit her works at a one-artist show in the Wustum museum at Racine.  About tow years ago one of her paintings was reproduced in Life magazine with a picture of the artist at her easel.<br>
On three separate occasions she was accepted to exhibit at the Sculptors and Painters showing in Milwaukee.  The third was a distinct recognition, since it made her eligible for membership in the organization.<br>
Outstanding Rural Artist<br>
The Madison Art association, which holds an exhibition every winter at the Memorial Union purchased from Mrs. Lalk, a rural oil painting showing the Lalk farm several years ago to add to their traveling exhibit.<br>
She received recognition in the Milwaukee Journal in September, 1942, when she was described as Wisconsin's outstanding rural artist.<br>
Mrs. Lalk's outstanding talent was recognized by John Stewart Curry, artist in residence at the University of Wisconsin, and Robert Von Neuman, well known Milwaukee artist, and was encouraged to continue her paintings.<br>
Some Pastel Sketches<br>
Most of her work was done in oils but she did some pastel sketches of orchids, four of which are now owned by the Fort Atkinson Memorial hospital, some water color work and tempera.  She also sculptured. Most of her paintings were of rural scenes in Wisconsin.<br>
Every year she entered some of her paintings at the State Fair and won many first prizes there, every year winning a ribbon.  The College of Agriculture at Madison has on display several of her oils.<br>
After an article about her appeared in the Chicago Tribune she received many requests to talk about her painting at clubs and organizations in surrounding towns.<br>
Mrs. Lalk, who studied at the Chicago Art institute and in Milwaukee, is credited with organizing and teaching the first class in fine arts in Fort Atkinson.<br>
In 1938 she received honorable mention in the national safety poster contest in which there were 3,026 entries.  Her painting was one of the few in that group to be sent out on exhibition.<br>
Surviving besides her husband, Henry Lalk, are two sons, Warren and Robert of Midland, MI, both of whom are employed at the Dow Chemical company there; two sisters, Mrs. Dwight Wiley of Delavan, MN, Mrs. Effie Hawley, Seattle, WA;  two brothers, Dewey Brinker, Paukwanna, SD, Charles Brinker, Saint Peter, MN; half brother, Dr. Clarence Hotchkiss of Beaver Dam; and two grandchildren.<br>
--------------------------------------------------------------<br>
From Rural artists of Wisconsin (1948)<br>
For Forty years Millie Rose Lalk lived the harmonious, uneventful life of a conventional, mild-mannered American. During this time her only art work was the painting of an occasional oil as she stole time from her many duties as mother, farm housewife, and friendly neighbor. Then, almost suddenly, she became a serious painter aware of new principles, intent upon new meanings, and productive of far more significant work. For years this farm woman had dabbled at painting drab, uninspired oils of grapes and pears and of chromo-like landscapes of mountains, lakes, and hunting scenes. Searching through her small collection of early work one finds nothing to suggest the power of expression and experimental textures she was to develop during the last few years of her life.   The art classes she attended in high school had inspired her to do nothing more original nor exciting than a series of school-girl portraits of fashionable young ladies in the manner of James Montgomery Flagg. Nor did three months' attendance at a special course offered by the Chicago Art Institute have any marked effect. The metamorphosis may be explained in part by the inner brooding of spirit that a series of especially profound experiences engendered in her. When in 1935 her youngest son died, her husband noticed a change in her personality. She became introspective and began to devote much more of her time to sketching and painting. For a time, however, her renewed interest in painting resulted in nothing exceptional. She received honorable mention for a poster submitted in a national contest, and she undertook a number of large barn murals near Fort Atkinson, advertising Guernsey cows for the local breeders' association.   There can be little doubt that among the experiences that were most fruitful for Mrs. Lalk was a series of meetings with Curry. In 1940, having entered a rather prosaic oil, "Filling Silo," in the first Rural Art Exhibit, she attended Curry's tour of the gallery. He appraised and criticized each picture before the assembled group of rural artists. She listened thoughtfully to his succinct advice: "Use more color.... Develop your own style. Don't change it for someone else's.... Paint the world you see about you.... Paint the things about which you have feeling." The next year Mrs. Lalk submitted a large, ambitious oil depicting her own family group busy in a barnyard full of huge sows and their litters. When someone criticized the immense snout of one of the sows as being out of proportion, Curry replied, "That's a part of the design; it looks more like a pig than a pig does." A year later Mrs. Lalk succeeded in placing an oil - a modern, symbolic treatment of the subject of the golden calf -among the professionals in the annual Wisconsin Salon. Thereafter until her death in August, 1943, Mrs. Lalk's work received increasing recognition.<br>
   Perhaps the most profound event in her life was her discovery in 1941 that she was seriously ill. A deeply religious woman, she refused to be shocked out of her normal way of life or to give way to invalidism. Few people knew that she was a sick woman, but it may have been her awareness that time was running out which prompted her to offer advice to all those who, endowed with a little talent, were planning to have fun with it "when there is time" - which for most people means when they grow old. "Don't wait," she said on one occasion in 1942. "Play around with your hobby as you live your busiest years. It keeps you stimulated and interested, and you may surprise yourself by developing something really good." She herself had led too busy a life to realize her own potentialities. She was born on the edge of the town of Whitewater in 1895. Her father, John Brinker, a machinist of Dutch ancestry, kept the family of six on the move as he obtained employment in various small woolen mills in the midwest. When Millie Rose started school the family lived in Grafton in Ozaukee County. Two years later the Brinkers were in Maguoketa, Illinois. But that job, like the rest proved to be temporary, and soon they were again living in Wisconsin, this time in Janesville. When she was graduated from the local high school in 1913, Millie Rose was undecided about the future. Two years later she entered the Janesville Business College, where she met Henry H. Lalk, a fellow student. Their marriage in 1916 was followed by two brief attempts at business, one with the Jamesway Company and the other operating an auto livery. In 1917 the young couple decided to farm and moved to eighty acres near Chippewa Falls. There the first of three boys was born in 1918. The young farmer's wife was much too busy to spend any more time at the easel. A year later the farm was sold, and they moved three times in rapid succession. Finally, in 1926 they bought a hundred-acre farm on the Janesville road. It lies among rolling hills dotted with tree clumps and commands a view of Lake Koshkonong. It was this farm that supplied subjects for Mrs. Lalk during the 1940's.   When her two boys had left for the University and she had moved to a country home near Fort Atkinson, she was able to transfer her energies to art. In the few short years that remained to her, she crowded the days with activity. Months before her death she knew she had not long to live, but she continued to work with remarkable productivity. In the autumn of 1942 she was asked to exhibit her work in a one-artist show at the Wustum Museum at Racine. In September she had been recognized by the Milwaukee Journal as Wisconsin's outstanding rural artist. For the third time her work was shown at the Sculptors and Painters exhibition in Milwaukee, making her eligible for membership    in that organization. Her entries at the state fair brought her two first prizes. She was featured in Life, and an article about her in a Chicago newspaper brought numerous invitations to talk about her paintings before organizations in near-by towns. She is credited with organizing and teaching the first fine arts class in Fort Atkinson. She was among the first to be selected by the Rural Art Committee for representation in the Permanent Collection. Her works were exhibited by the Madison Art Association, Beloit College, the Milwaukee Art Institute, Purdue University, and in 1943 the Chicago Art Institute. Her painting "Our Farm in Wisconsin with Lake Koshkonong in the Distance" was requested from the Chicago exhibit by the Illinois State Museum at Springfield, where it was hanging at the time of her death. She had continued active and productive until the last two and a half weeks of her life.   What was the secret of those creative years? It was as if she had borrowed time and was hastening to repay it with a gift which was to live for her. Or perhaps the educational philosophers have a word for it: that dreams and hopes may lie buried in the minds of men to awaken long after the age when the schools suggest that we stop learning.<br>

Woolen mill survives lack of sheep, test of time by Tim King, The Land Correspondent, 22 October 2004<br>
<br>
The Indian uprising of the 1860s, the onslaught of inexpensive synthetic fibers and the devastating tornado of 1998 all have failed to stop the Saint Peter Woolen Mill from nearly 140 consecutive years of service to shepherds and the general public.<br>
<br>
Throughout those 14 decades, the mill has always delivered custom wool washing and carding services to area shepherds. The Saint Peter Woolen Mill's history makes it the oldest custom wool-processing company in Minnesota.<br>
<br>
In addition to custom processing, the Saint Peter Woolen Mill has a line of woolen comforters, mattress pads and pillows. These bedding products, marketed under the Nature's Comfort label, are sold wholesale to more than 30 stores and via the company's Web site and retail store in Saint Peter. For shepherds looking to add value to their wool, the Saint Peter Woolen Mill can turn wool into a similar line of products for shepherds to market individually.<br>
<br>
"We even will make a customized label for you to put on your mattress pad or comforter," said Patricia Johnson who, with Peggy Grey, currently owns and manages the mill.<br>
<br>
The woolen mill actually began business in the village of Traverse in the 1850s, under the ownership of Ed Borneman. When Saint Peter won the contest to be the county seat for Nicollet County a decade later, Borneman (and most everybody else in Traverse) pulled up stakes and moved to Saint Peter.<br>
<br>
"The sheep industry was thriving at the time," Johnson said. "Every other person had sheep in their back yard, and there was a wool mill every 30 miles."<br>
<br>
The industry was still thriving when Pat's great grandfather John Charles Brinker and his wife, Margaret, purchased the mill from Borneman in 1912.<br>
<br>
Wool fiber for bedding and clothing remained a vital part of the economy until synthetic fibers became popular in the 1950s and 1960s. The result of the synthetic fiber boom was that sheep largely disappeared from the farm yard and woolen mills disappeared from small towns. Today there are no more than a handful spread across the nation. The Saint Peter Woolen Mill is one of them.<br>
<br>
The mill has survived because the four generations of the Brinker family that have managed it have pursued a flexible business strategy while maintaining their traditional services. Wool purchasing is one of the areas the current management team has been flexible about.<br>
<br>
"We used to buy the wool for our wholesale products locally but then we could not get enough," Johnson said. "Now we buy from a wool cooperative, and they sort and grade it to our specifications."<br>
<br>
Even though there are no longer enough sheep in south central Minnesota to support the Saint Peter Woolen Mills buying needs, the mill continues to provide one of the services it provided back in great grandfather Brinker's time when most families had a few sheep. The mill will restore your family comforter to its original fluffy state.<br>
<br>
"We can recard the wool to make it fluffy again and, if necessary, add new wool," Johnson said. "We have a line of fabrics so we can also help you choose a new cover if you want."<br>
<br>
Whether she's talking about traditional services such as restoring family comforters and custom wool processing or talking about the Saint Peter Woolen Mill's line of fine bedding products, Johnson is an outspoken advocate of wool's value. She said that today's customers have to be re-educated when it comes to wool's superiority over synthetic fibers.<br>
<br>
"Wool is warmer in winter and cooler in summer than polyester," she said.<br>
<br>
Most everybody knows about wool's warmth for winter wear, but wool is not normally seen as something to wear to keep cool in the summer.<br>
<br>
"It wicks off the moisture from your body while polyester, which is essentially plastic, traps it," Johnson said.<br>
<br>
She also said most of what you think you know about washing wool is simply myth, not fact. To wash wool you need to take only one precaution. You need to wash it gently by hand. You can wash it in any soap and in the hottest water you want. That won't harm your wool sweater. But if you wash it in a washing machine with an agitator or even handle it roughly during dry cleaning, it will shrink.<br>
<br>
Well, that's another myth too. Wool doesn't actually shrink. It gets matted. Felt is the correct term, according to Johnson.<br>
<br>
"Wool fibers have little barbs and so does human hair," she said. "You can wash hair in hot water with strong soaps and it doesn't shrink. But if you have long hair and rub it together, it becomes matted. That's what happens to wool when you wash it too vigorously. That's what shrinking is."<br>
<br>
When wool is treated properly, the barbs are an asset. Because of the tiny barbs, Johnson said, wool is better in a comforter than even down. Down, she said, doesn't have barbs to hold it together. As a result down settles to the corners of a comforter while wool holds together and stays put.<br>

Wallace Reed Brode<br>
June 12, 1900 to August 10, 1974<br>
By Donald S. McClure<br>
<br>
DURING HIS LIFETIME WALLACE Brode was known for his broadly based development of applied spectroscopy and for his able administration of numerous science-related organizations. He was equally at home in academe and in government. He used his high intellect and breadth of knowledge to promote the welfare of other people, being truly a scientific statesman.<br>
He was born on June 12, 1900, as one of triplet brothers, each of whom became distinguished as a scientist. Their father, Howard, was a professor of biology, teaching at Whitman College in Walla Walla, a small town in southeastern Washington, where the family was reared. Like other colleges in the Northwest at that time, Whitman had been struggling out of its recent pioneer past in an attempt to become a credible educational institution with slim financial resources but having a dedicated president and faculty.1 Everyone--father, mother, the triplets (Wallace, Robert,2 and Malcolm), and an older son, Stanley--worked for or studied in the college, learning high ideals and hard work. Howard Brode is still honored by a yearly lectureship at Whitman College.<br>
After receiving his B.S. at Whitman, Wallace studied under Roger Adams at the University of Illinois and was awarded his Ph.D. in 1925 with a thesis entitled "A Study of Optically Active Dyes, Mechanism of Dyeing and Absorption Spectra." His lifelong interest in dyes and the relation between their color and their constitution began here.<br>
During his graduate school days he demonstrated an ability to handle several jobs at once: He was listed as a junior chemist at the National Bureau of Standards (NBS) in Washington, D.C., where he found better equipment for his thesis project, but was still a student and assistant at the University of Illinois. The position at the NBS was his introduction to the institution where he later became associate director.<br>
In the years 1926-28 he was a Guggenheim fellow and did what budding scientists did then, went to Europe, where he studied at Leipzig (with Arthur Hantzsch), Zurich (with Victor Henri), and Liverpool (with E. C. C. Baly and R. A. Morton). Publications from these visits appeared promptly in the chemical literature. At the same time, however, he had an appointment with the Bureau of Engraving and Printing to travel in Canada and Europe and to report on methods of currency printing in those places. He was complimented for doing an effective job while getting his travel expenses taken care of. He returned to the United States to take up an appointment as assistant professor of chemistry at Ohio State University in the fall of 1928.<br>
During his 20 years at OSU he produced most of the work in spectroscopy for which he is known. His book Chemical Spectroscopy appeared in 1939, the outgrowth of notes for a course in this subject, and in a greatly expanded second edition in 1943, which sold about 10,000 copies.3 It was the first book to cover a broad range of topics in spectroscopy of interest to chemists. His research papers during this period (about 65) deal with the relation between absorption spectra and constitution of organic dyes, optically active dyes, analytical applications of spectroscopy, and several other subjects. He trained about 40 graduate students during his tenure at OSU, many of whom later assumed major positions in industry and academe.<br>
His course on spectroscopy was well attended, and he must have spent much time and thought on teaching effectively. He persuaded Sargent Scientific Co. to manufacture the ball-and-stick molecular models he designed in 1930, which later became standard teaching aids in chemistry courses everywhere. He designed and built one of the first recording spectrophotometer/spectropolarimeters (1941).<br>
He had a fascination for solar eclipses and observed about six. He was a member of the observing team of a successful expedition in Russian Siberia in June of 1936. This was followed by a grand tour of Russian universities and astronomical observatories. His ability to design and use spectrographic equipment was crucial to the success of these expeditions. His first wife, a physicist at the NBS whom he married in 1926, accompanied him on the Russian expedition. This marriage ended in divorce a few years later.<br>
In late 1940 or early 1941 he was hospitalized for an infection that had to be treated with an antibiotic. His condition worsened until an alert head nurse, Ione (Sunny) Sundstrom, realized that it was the wrong medicine. He was saved and shortly afterward he married Sunny.<br>
During the war he became associated with the Office of Scientific Research and Development and was head of the Paris branch in 1944-45. Intelligence was the function of this branch, and he followed the armed forces as they advanced in order to learn as much as possible about scientific and technical matters in the formerly occupied territory. One example was the manufacture of hydrogen peroxide in highly concentrated form, the oxidant in the V-2 rockets.<br>
Extending his leave from OSU, he became head of the science department at the Naval Ordnance Test Station, Inyokern, California, 1945-47. He turned down an offer to extend his tenure there but remained as a consultant for some time. While still a professor at OSU in 1947, he accepted a temporary position at the NBS as an associate director, but later that same year he acceded to a request from the Central Intelligence Agency to set up a science advisory branch in that organization. He worked very effectively at this project for most of a year but, realizing that he was losing contact with science and scientists, he felt that he could not continue to attract well-qualified people and asked for a part-time arrangement with the NBS. This was not agreed to, so with three jobs to choose from he made up his mind to resign his rather neglected professorship at OSU and in 1948 became associate director of the NBS.<br>
His acceptance, however, depended on a commitment from the then director, Edward Condon, that he could have a small laboratory where he could continue active research. This research was carried on with the help of George Wyman, John Gould, and later May Inscoe, who worked on the spectroscopy of dye molecules. During the years of this project they discovered some unexpected photochemical changes in the spectra and thus began accidentally a study of photochemistry.<br>
Wallace had under his cognizance the following areas of the NBS: chemistry, metallurgy, mineral products, organic and fibrous materials, optics and metrology, foreign relations, education (the NBS had a graduate school), and editorial and publications.<br>
He was an able administrator and was genuinely interested in the people who staffed these programs. He gave encouragement to many young people in furthering their professional careers. In addition to the above duties he edited the Journal of the Optical Society of America with the aid of his assistant, Mary Corning.<br>
Honors that came to him during this period were election to the National Academy of Sciences in 1954, an honorary degree from Whitman College, and an honorary degree from Ohio State University. These two educational institutions sought his advice on several occasions, and he actively assisted in several projects for them.<br>
In his new position Wallace became increasingly a public figure, as the activities of the NBS had impacts on society. In one very public fracas Eisenhower's new secretary of commerce, Sinclair Weeks, actually "fired" the NBS director, Allen V. Astin, when he refused to accept the "judgment of the market place" for a highly promoted battery additive, ADX-2, which NBS research had shown to be worthless. In the uproar that followed, during which Brode and others testified before Congress, the firing was rescinded and Astin served as director for many years afterward. On this and many other occasions Wallace found himself explaining to non-scientists what science is all about. (The hazards of being director of the NBS are also illustrated by the case of Edward Condon, who was hounded by the House Committee on Un-American Activities from March 1948 until he resigned in August 1951. These were the first three years of Brode's associate directorship.)<br>
During this period the NBS was outgrowing its downtown Washington headquarters, and over Wallace's strong objections the decision was finally made to move out of town to Gaithersburg, Maryland. He feared that the NBS would lose valuable contacts with other science-based organizations in Washington and that he personally would lose many valuable ties there. Thus in 1958 he resigned his position at the NBS. He was the obvious choice for the next job, science advisor to Secretary of State John Foster Dulles and later Christian Herter. Probably the major motivation to place a prominent scientist in this position was the sudden realization that the United States was years behind the Soviet Union in space science (the Soviets had just launched their first Sputniks, while the United States months later launched the much smaller Explorers). One aim of this job was the re-establishment of scientific attaché positions in a number of embassies. He was able to persuade several reputable scientists to accept such posts and to identify major scientific opportunities and concerns within the context of foreign policy.<br>
In this same year, 1958, he assumed several new positions: president of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, member of the Board of Governors of the American Institute of Physics, and member of the President's Committee on Scientists and Engineers. He was already a director of the American Chemical Society. He also received two honors: the Exceptional Service Medal from the Department of Commerce for his work at the NBS and the Applied Spectroscopy Medal from the Society for Applied Spectroscopy. In a few more years he became the president of the Optical Society of America in 1961, president of Sigma Xi in 1961, and was awarded the Priestley Medal of the American Chemical Society, its highest award, in 1960. He became president of the American Chemical Society in 1969. This list does not include the many committees and boards he joined during his Washington years.<br>
Because he was a public figure he was invited to give talks at special occasions. He was both entertaining and informative. One subject that seemed especially needed in Washington was the distinction between science and pseudoscience. He also published articles on scientific manpower, developing a national science program, international aspects of science, and science in elementary schools, all of these being subjects of great interest to him.<br>
The 26 years in Washington must have been the best in his busy life. He was a member and officer of the professionally and socially important Cosmos Club where visitors to Washington could be hosted. He and Sunny had a beautiful apartment across the street from the NBS, where many friends were entertained and Wallace could use his musical talents. He could sing parts in Gilbert and Sullivan operettas and also played the flute, as did his brother Robert. These two brothers had great affection for each other and met often in Washington and Berkeley.<br>
Wallace and Sunny made many trips to the American Southwest to indulge their deep interest in American Indian history, culture, and arts. They possessed many unique and beautiful examples of pottery, baskets, and fabrics. Wallace's knowledge of dyes and dyeing led him to study the natural dyes and pigments used by the Indians.<br>
After leaving the State Department in 1960 he had no major institutional affiliation and was able to write, travel, attend to professional society duties, and consult for industry. As his reputation had grown over the years, he was in great demand as lecturer, counselor, and consultant. He was a highly organized person as his detailed diaries show and he remained heavily engaged in these activities for the rest of his life. He died of cancer at the age of 74.<br>
In the words of one who knew him well, "Wallace was a man of unusual intellect with a rare depth and breadth of knowledge. He could extrapolate from specifics and details to broader concepts, from one discipline to interdisciplinary considerations. He was the epitome of integrity in science and in public service."<br>
<br>
CONTRIBUTIONS TO SCIENCE BY WALLACE BRODE<br>
Brode's scientific publications can be arranged in the following categories beginning with the most important one: relation between the optical spectrum and the structure of organic dyes; analytical methods; organic synthesis; colors and spectra of some inorganic materials; and chemistry of the fatty acids.<br>
Brode's studies of the chemistry and spectroscopy of organic dyes began in 1922 when he was a graduate student of Roger Adams at the University of Illinois. Synthetic organic chemistry had been developing rapidly at this time, driven in part by the search for new dyes. A central question was how does the molecular structure of a dye determine its color? Spectrographs of that period, though clumsy and inaccurate, could measure the absorption spectrum responsible for color, but the absorption bands could not be explained by existing theory: Consider that G. N. Lewis had proposed the electron pair bond only in 1916, and Schroedinger's equation was still to come. In the expectation that useful empirical understanding of the spectra would result, Brode produced a series of carefully executed and extensive studies of the effects of structure on the absorption bands, published from 1926 to 1959.<br>
The azo compounds, related to azobenzene, are the commonest types of dye molecule. They could be prepared easily and in great variety. A typical study was to add substituents such as methyl, halogen, or nitro at various positions on the benzene rings and see how the spectrum changed. Alternatively, one could couple two azobenzenes at the para, meta, or ortho positions and determine from the spectrum how much the two parts interacted. The results showed the importance of the planarity and conjugation of pi-electron systems. Later, with his NBS group he worked on indigo-type dyes in which the photochemistry or sometimes its absence was the most important aspect. For example, the inhibition of cis-trans isomerization by hydrogen bonding in these dyes was discovered.<br>
In the meantime quantum theory was being discovered and developed and actually applied to large molecules. Some of the earliest thinking was done by G. N. Lewis and Melvin Calvin and by T. Foerster in the 1930s. In the next decade Coulson and Longuet-Higgins and later Dewar were making good sense of the spectra of aromatic molecules. During the 1950s the Pariser-Parr-Pople method was being applied with the help of increasingly capable computers. Brode never caught this wave, and much of his detailed work remains to be interpreted in terms of molecular electronic structure. Nevertheless, he did build a large body of information on dye spectra that has been extensively referenced and has influenced the field down to the present day.<br>
