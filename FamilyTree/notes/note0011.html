First marriage to  Finnsdottir Ingibiorg Earls Mother<br />
Children by that marriage:<br />
  Malcolm of Scotland<br />
  Donald of Scotland<br />
  Duncan King of Scotland II b: ABT. 1060<br />
 <br />
King Malcolm III of Scotland (Máel Coluim mac Donnchada), (1031-November 13, 1093) also known as Malcolm Canmore (Malcolm with the large head)'Cean Mor' meaning 'Big Head' in Gaidhlig, was the eldest son of King Duncan I of Scotland and first king of the House of Dunkeld.<br />
 <br />
In 1040 his father was killed in battle by his cousin Macbeth I of Scotland who became the new king. Malcolm found refuge in England under the protection of King Hardicanute of Denmark and England. In 1042 Hardicanute died and was succeeded to the throne of England by his half-brother King Edward the Confessor. In 1053 Edward finally agreed to help Malcolm gain the throne of Scotland by offering him an army. Malcolm's invasion of Scotland started in the same year. Malcolm found support from the nobles of Southern Scotland. He managed to kill first Macbeth in 1057 and then his successor King Lulach I of Scotland in 1058. He then succeeded Lulach as king. He was crowned at Scone Abbey, Perthshire, on April 25, 1058. He married Ingibjörg Finnsdóttir, widow of the Jarl of Orkney, in about 1065 and they had three sons: Duncan, Domnall (d.1085), and Malcolm (d. after 1094). Ingibjörg was dead by 1070, when he wed Margaret.<br />
 <br />
He agreed on an alliance with England, sealed by his (second) marriage to Saint Margaret, Edgar Atheling's sister. Margaret herself promoted the Roman Catholic Church in Scotland throughout Malcolm's reign. At that time, Christianity did exist in Scotland in the form of the Celtic Church, but varied from Roman Catholic practice in some respects e.g. the dating of Easter and the shape of monks' tonsures. Malcolm had several sons by Margaret - these became known as the Margaretsons. Malcolm and Margaret's children were:<br />
 <br />
   1. Prince Edward of Scotland, killed 1093.<br />
   2. King Edmund I of Scotland<br />
   3. Ethelred, Earl of Fife<br />
   4. King Edgar I of Scotland<br />
   5. King Alexander I of Scotland<br />
   6. King David I of Scotland<br />
   7. Edith of Scotland, also called Matilda, married King Henry I of England<br />
   8. Mary of Scotland, married Eustace III of Boulogne<br />
 <br />
During his reign Scotland fell under the influence of England. The Lowlands of Scotland started speaking an early Scots dialect and adopting Anglo-Saxon habits. Malcolm unsuccessfully tried to stop this influence by waging wars against the Norman kings of England after 1066. In 1072 he was forced to give an oath of subservience to William I of England.<br />
 <br />
His war against William II of England in 1093 only led to the loss of Scottish territory to England. Malcolm died on November of the same year in an ambush at Alnwick during a battle against William's army. His eldest son by Margaret, Edward, also died in that ambush. Malcolm was succeeded by his brother Donald III of Scotland.<br />
 <br />
Malcolm established the Dunkeld dynasty which ruled Scotland from 1058 until 1286. Four of his sons (Duncan II, Edgar, Alexander I, and David I) became kings of Scotland, whilst a fifth (Edmund) ruled as co-ruler of Scotland with his uncle Donald III.<br />

David I, known as "the Saint", (1084 - May 24, 1153), king of Scotland,the youngest son of Malcolm Canmore and of Saint Margaret (sister ofEdgar Ætheling), was born in 1084. He married in 1113 Matilda, daughterand heiress of Waltheof, Earl of Northumbria, and thus gained possessionof the earldom of Huntingdon.<br />
 <br />
On the death of Edgar, king of Scotland, in 1107, the territories of the Scottish crown were divided in accordance with the terms of his will between his two brothers, Alexander and David. Alexander, together with the crown, received Scotland north of the Forth and Clyde, David the southern district with the title of earl of Cumbria. The death of Alexander in 1124 gave David possession of the whole starting on April 27 of that year.<br />
 <br />
In 1127, in the character of an English baron, he swore fealty to Matilda as heiress to her father Henry I, and when the usurper Stephen ousted her in 1135 David vindicated her cause in arms and invaded England. But Stephen marched north with a great army, whereupon David made peace. The peace, however, was not kept. After threatening an invasion in 1137, David marched into England in 1138, but sustained a crushing defeat on Cutton Moor in the engagement known as the Battle of the Standard.<br />
 <br />
He returned to Carlisle, and soon afterwards concluded peace. In 1141 he joined Matilda in London and accompanied her to Winchester, but after a narrow escape from capture he returned to Scotland. Henceforth he remained in his own kingdom and devoted himself to its political and ecclesiastical reorganization. A devoted son of the church, he founded five bishoprics and many monasteries. In secular politics he energetically forwarded the process of feudalization which his immediate predecessors had initiated . He died at Carlisle.<br />
 <br />
He had two sons, Malcolm (not to be confused with Malcolm IV of Scotland, this Malcolm's nephew) and Henry and two daughters, Claricia and Hodierna.<br />

Maud, 2nd Countess of Huntingdon (1074-1130) was the daughter ofWaltheof, Earl of Northumbria, the last of the major Anglo-Saxon earls toremain powerful after the Norman conquest in 1066. Her mother was Judith,a niece of William the Conqueror. She inherited her father's earldom ofHuntingdon and married twice.<br />
 <br />
Her mother, Judith, refused to marry Simon of St Liz. This refusal angered her uncle, King William, who confiscated Judith's estates after she fled the country. Instead her daughter Maud was married to Simon of St Liz in 1090. She had a number of children with St Liz including Simon and Maud.<br />
 <br />
Her first husband died in 1109 and Maud next married King David I of Scotland in 1113. From this marriage she had four children, two sons, Malcolm and Henry and two daughters, Claricia and Hodierna. The Scottish royal house produced the remaining Earls of Huntingdon of the first creation of the title. She was succeeded to the Earldom of Huntingdon by her son Henry.<br />
 <br />
According to John of Fordun, she died in 1130 and was buried at Scone, but she appears in a charter dated 1147.<br />

Son of Gilbert de Clare, 5th Earl of Hertford and Isabel Marshall,daughter of William Marshall and Isabel de Clare. A year after he becameof age, he was in an expedition against the Welsh. Through his mother heinherited a fifth part of the Marshall estates, including Kilkenny andother lordships in Ireland. In 1232 Richard was secretly married toMargaret (Megotta) de Burgh, daughter of Hubert de Burgh, Earl of Kent.Both bride and groom were aged about ten. Megotta died in November 1327.Before she had even died, the earl of Lincoln offered 5,000 marks to KingHenry to secure Richard for his own daughter. This offer was accepted,and Richard was married secondly, on or before 25 January 1237, Maud deLacy, daughter of the Surety John de Lacy and Margaret Quincy.<br />
 <br />
He joined in the Barons' letter to the Pope in 1246 against the exactions of the Curia in England. He was among those in opposition to the King's half-brothers, who in 1247 visited England, where they were very unpopular, but afterwards he was reconciled to them.<br />
 <br />
On April 1248, he had letters of protection for going over seas on a pilgrimage. At Christmas 1248, he kept his Court with great splendor on the Welsh border. In the next year he went on a pilgrimage to St. Edmund at Pontigny, returning in June. In 1252 he observed Easter at Tewkesbury, and then went across the seas to restore the honor of his brother William, who had been badly worsted in a tournament and had lost all his arms and horses. The Earl is said to have succeeded in recovering all, and to have returned home with great credit, and in September he was present at the Round Table tournament at Walden.<br />
 <br />
In August 1252/3 the King crossed over to Gascony with his army, and to his great indignation the Earl refused to accompany him and went to Ireland instead. In August 1255 he and John Maunsel were sent to Edinburgh by the King to find out the truth regarding reports which had reached the King that his son-in-law, Alexander, King of Scotland, was being coerced by Robert de Roos and John Baliol. If possible, they were to bring the young King and Queen to him. The Earl and his companion, pretending to be the two of Roos's knights, obtained entry to Edinburgh Castle, and gradually introduced their attendants, so that they had a force sufficient for their defense. They gained access to the Scottish Queen, who made her complaints to them that she and her husband had been kept apart. They threatened Roos with dire punishments, so that he promised to go to the King.<br />
 <br />
Meanwhile the Scottish magnates, indignant at their castle of Edinburgh's being in English hands, proposed to besiege it, but they desisted when they found they would be besieging their King and Queen. The King of Scotland apparently traveled South with the Earl, for on 24 September they were with King Henry III at Newminster, Northumberland. In July 1258 he fell ill, being poisoned with his brother William, as it was supposed, by his steward, Walter de Scotenay. He recovered but his brother died.<br />
 <br />
Richard died at John de Griol's manor of Asbenfield in Waltham, near Canterbury, 15 July 1262, it being rumored that he had been poisoned at the table of Piers of Savoy. On the following Monday he was carried to Canterbury where a mass for the dead was sung, after which his body was taken to the canon's church at Tonbridge and interred in the choir. Thence it was taken to Tewkesbury and buried 28 July 1262, with great solemnity in the presence of two bishops and eight abbots in the presbytery at his father's right hand.<br />

 <br />
Saint Margaret of Scotland (circa 1045 - November 16, 1093), Edgar Atheling's sister, married King Malcolm Canmore.<br />
 <br />
The daughter of the English prince Edward the Exile or "Edward Outremer", son of Edmund Ironside, Margaret was probably born in Hungary. The provenance of her mother Agatha is disputed: certainly related to the kings of Hungary, she was either a descendant of Emperor Henry III or a daughter of Yaroslav I of Kiev.<br />
 <br />
When her uncle, King Edward the Confessor, died in 1066, she was living in England where her brother, Edgar Atheling, had decided to make a claim to the vacant throne. After the conquest of England by the Normans, the widowed Agatha decided to leave Northumberland with her children and return to the Continent, but a storm drove their ship to Scotland where they sought the protection of King Malcolm Canmore. Malcolm was a widower, and taken with Margaret's beauty and viture. The marriage of Malcolm and Margaret soon took place and was followed by several invasions of Northumberland by the Scottish king, probably in support of the claims of his brother-in-law Edgar. These, however, had little result beyond the devastation of the province.<br />
 <br />
Far more important were the effects of this alliance upon the history of Scotland. A considerable portion of the old Northumbrian kingdom had been reduced by the Scottish kings in the previous century, but up to this time the English population had little influence upon the ruling element of the kingdom. Malcolm's marriage undoubtedly improved the condition of the English to a great extent, and under Margaret's sons, Edgar, Alexander I and David I, the Scottish court practically became anglicized. Margaret was very religious, and saw to the building of churches and the preservation of sacred relics. She rebuilt the monastery of Iona, and provided a free ferry and housing for pilgrims coming to visit the shrine of Saint Andrew. She was a lavish alms-giver, and paid the ransoms of English hostages held by the Scots.<br />
 <br />
Margaret and Malcolm had eight children, six sons and two daughters:<br />
   1. Prince Edward of Scotland, killed 1093.<br />
   2. King Edmund I of Scotland<br />
   3. Ethelred, Earl of Fife<br />
   4. King Edgar I of Scotland<br />
   5. King Alexander I of Scotland<br />
   6. King David I of Scotland<br />
   7. Edith of Scotland, also called Matilda, married King Henry I of England<br />
   8. Mary of Scotland, married Eustace III of Boulogne<br />
 <br />
Her husband Malcolm and their eldest son Edward were killed in battle against the English in November 1093. Her son Edmund was left with the task of telling his mother of their deaths. Margaret was ill, and she died on 16 November, 1093, four days after the deaths her husband and her eldest son.<br />
 <br />
She was canonised in 1251 by Pope Innocent IV on account of her great benefactions to the Church. The Roman Catholic church formerly marked the feast of Saint Margaret of Scotland on June 10, but the date was transferred to November 16 in the liturgical reform of 1972.<br />

Princess Anne of Kiev (1024 - 1075), daughter of Yaroslav I, was Queen of France, as the wife of King Henri I. After the death of his first wife, Mathilde, King Henri had searched the courts of Europe for a suitable bride, but could not locate a princess who was not related to him within illegal degrees of kinship. At last he sent an embassy to distant Kiev, who returned with Anne (also called Agnes or Anna). Anne and Henri were married at the cathedral of Reims, May 19, 1051. They had three sons:<br />
    * Philippe I, King of France (May 23, 1052 - July 30, 1108)<br />
    * Hugues ("Magnus"), later Count of Crépi (1057 - October 18, 1102), who married the heiress of Vermandois and died on crusade in Tarsus, Cilicia.<br />
    * Robert (ca 1055 - ca 1060)<br />
 <br />
For six years after his death in 1060, she served as regent for their son, Philip, who was 7 at the time of his father's death. She was the first queen of France to serve as regent. Her co-regent was Count Baldwin V of Flanders. Anne was known as a literate woman, rare for the time, but there was some opposition to her as Regent on the grounds that her mastery of French was less than fluent.<br />
 <br />
A year after the King's death, Anne, acting as Regent took a passionate fancy for Count Raoul III of Valois and of the Vexin, a man whose political ambition encouraged him to repudiate his wife to marry Anne in 1062. Accused of adultery, Raoul's wife appealed to Pope Alexander II, who excommunicated Raoul and Anne. The young king Philippe forgave his mother, which was just as well, since he was to find himself in a very similar predicament in the 1090s. Raoul died in September 1074, at which time Anne returned to the French court. She died in 1079, and her obits were celebrated on September 5.<br />

 <br />
Sigurd the Dane, also known as Siward, was an English nobleman in the Eleventh Century, and the Earl of Northumbria.<br />
 <br />
Siward was a descendant of the Danish royal family, whose ancestors had arrived in England a few generations earlier as part of the Norse colonization of Britain. He was the hereditary ruler of Northumbria.<br />
 <br />
He served as a general to Hardicanute and Edward the Confessor, and gained great reknown for his skills as a soldier. He was related to the Scottish royal family, and was either the uncle or the brother-in-law of Malcolm Canmore (one text erroneously calls him his grandfather). Following Macbeth's defeat of Malcolm's father King Duncan I in 1040, the infant Malcolm was sent to Northumbria to be guarded by Siward. In 1053, Edward the Confessor agreed to assist the now adult Malcolm in taking the throne of Scotland, and designated Siward as leader of the English army. Siward's first incursion met with limited success, capturing the fortress Dunsinane in 1054, but Macbeth was not decisively defeated until 1057 at Lumphanan. One of Siward's own sons, Osberne, was killed during the campaign in Scotland.<br />
 <br />

The ancestry of Godred Crovan (d. 1095), king of Dublin and Man, is notwell documented, and there are differing opinions regarding his parentageand immediate ancestors. Rather than try to give a definitive solution tothe problem, the basic evidence will be outlined, and several possiblealternatives will be given, along with their strengths and weaknesses.Since the basic raw data is itself somewhat contradictory, none of thesuggested alternatives will fit all of the primary evidence.<br />
 <br />
The basic raw data is as follows. First, the Annals of Tigernach [AT] for the year 1091 refer to him as the son of the son of Harald ["Goffraidh mac Maic Arailt, ŕı Atha Cliath."]. Then, there is the Chronicle of the Kings of Man [CRM], which states that Godred was the son of Harald the Black of "Ysland" (Iceland), without further identifying this Harald. Finally, there is the Welsh collection of Norse pedigrees in "Achau Brenhinoedd a Thywysogion Cymru" [ABT, in EWGT, pp. 95-110], which includes a genealogy of the kings of Man, as follows:<br />
 <br />
ABT.6c: Rhanallt m. Gwythryg m. Afloyd m. Gwrthryt mearch m. Harallt ddu m. Ifor gamle m. Afloyd m. Swtrig.<br />
 <br />
Changing the names from these Welsh forms to the more familiar English forms gives:<br />
 <br />
Reginald [king of Man, d. 14 Feb 1229], son of<br />
Godred [king of Man, d. 10 Nov 1187], son of<br />
Olaf [king of Man, d. 29 June 1153], son of<br />
Godred [Crovan, king of Dublin and Man, d. 1095], son of<br />
Harald ddu [i.e., the Black], son of<br />
Ivar gamle [i.e., the Old], son of<br />
Olaf [presumably Olaf Cuaran, king of Dublin and York], son of<br />
Sitric [d. 927]<br />
 <br />
It may be that the above genealogy was composed during the reign of Reginald (d. 1229), since he is the latest person mentioned in the genealogy. There is no way of knowing whether copying mistakes were made between that time of composition and the surviving manuscripts.<br />
 <br />
We now list several possibilities regarding the ancestry of Godred Crovan, along with the strengths and weaknesses of each possibility (some of which are valid for more than one case, and are therefore repeated). While there are other scenarios which could be listed, they would seem less likely than the ones given below.<br />
 <br />
Possibility 1: The genealogy of ABT is to be accepted as it is.<br />
Strengths: It requires no emendation of the genealogy in ABT. It agrees with the Chronicle of the kings of Man in making Godred the son of Harald "the Black".<br />
Weaknesses: No son of Olaf Cuaran named Ivar is known from the Irish records. The generations are a bit long (but not drastically so). It disagrees with the Annals of Tigernach, which make Godred the grandson of a certain Harald.<br />
 <br />
Possibility 2: In the process of copying the pedigree, a "Harald" was accidently omitted between Ivar and Olaf Cuaran, so that the pedigree should read Godred son of Harald the Black son of Ivar son of Harald son of Olaf [Cuaran].<br />
Strengths: Olaf Cuaran had a son named Harald, who in turn had a son named Ivar, both known from the Irish annals, so the agreement with the Irish annals would be excellent. It agrees with the Chronicle of the kings of Man in making Godred the son of Harald "the Black". The chronology fits better than Possibilities 1 and 3.<br />
Weaknesses: It requires an emendation of the pedigree in ABT. It disagrees with the Annals of Tigernach, which make Godred the grandson of a certain Harald.<br />
 <br />
Possibility 3: In the process of copying the pedigree, Harald and Ivar were accidently switched, so that the pedigree should read Godred son of Ivar son of Harald son of Olaf [Cuaran].<br />
Strengths: Olaf Cuaran had a son named Harald, who in turn had a son named Ivar, both known from the Irish annals, so the agreement with the Irish annals would be excellent. It agrees with the Annals of Tigernach, which call Godred the grandson of a certain Harald.<br />
Weaknesses: It requires an emendation of the pedigree in ABT. The generations are a bit long (but not drastically so). It disagrees the the Chronicle of the kings of Man, which make Godred the son of Harald the Black.<br />
 <br />
Possibility 4: The pedigree in ABT is wrong, and Godred was not a descendant of Olaf Cuaran, but was instead descended somehow from the kings of the Isles who ruled in the late tenth and early eleventh centuries.<br />
Strengths: It would explain Godred's claim to the kingship of Man. The known names used by the early dynasty of the kings of the Isles were Guthfrith (i.e., Godred), Harald, Lagman, Olaf, and Rognvald, which were exactly the names which were common in the family of Godred Crovan (including the rare name Lagman), so this possiblity has some onomastic support.<br />
Weakness: It requires abandoning the manuscript genealogy of ABT, so there is no direct supporting evidence. The onomastic argument is mitigated somewhat by the fact that the names Guthfrith, Harald, Olaf, and Rognvald were all common among the Hiberno-Norse in general, so that only the rare name Lagman carries significant weight in the onomastic argument.<br />
 <br />
Before I was aware of the genealogy in ABT, I favored possibility 4. Now that I know about the ABT genealogy, I think Possibility 2 is the most likely one. However, I think that none of the four possibilities can be ruled out, given the currently known evidence.<br />

 <br />
Later with his uncle Thomas Percy, Earl of Worcester, he led a rebellion against King Henry IV in 1403, forming an alliance with the Welsh rebel, Owain Glyndwr. Before they could join forces, Hotspur was defeated and killed at the Battle of Shrewsbury. He is a major character in Shakespeare's Henry IV, Part 1, though in the play he is portrayed as being of the same age as his main rival Prince Hal, when in fact he was considerably older.<br />
 <br />

Creoda (or Crida) (c. 5401 - 593) was the first monarch of Mercia (c. 585- 593).<br />
 <br />
Creoda is recorded as having been the son of Cynewald, the grandson of Cnebba, and the great-grandson of Icel; consequently, members of the Mercian royal line were known as Iclingas. Although this suggests that Creoda was only a fourth-generation descendant of the first Angles in England, the sources nevertheless record him as having been the first ruler of the Kingdom of Mercia. One explanation for this is that the Mercians had initially settled further east and only moved into the area of what became known as Mercia in the time of Creoda.<br />
 <br />
Like most of the early Anglo-Saxon kings, very little is known about his life. The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle records his death in the year 593.<br />

Henry Percy, 1st Earl of Northumberland (November 10, 1341 - February 20,1408), was the son of Henry, 3rd baron Percy, and the father of Henry"Harry Hotspur" Percy. His mother was Mary of Lancaster, daughter ofHenry Plantagenet, 3rd Earl of Leicester, son Edmund Crouchback, son ofHenry III of England.<br />
 <br />
Originally a follower of Edward III of England, for whom he held high offices in the administration of northern England, Henry Percy went on to support King Richard II. He was given the title of Marshal of England and created an earl at Richard's coronation (1377), but he switched to the side of Henry Bolingbroke (later, Henry IV) after Richard created his chief rival, Ralph Neville, 1st earl of Westmorland in 1399. On Henry's coronation he was appointed Constable of England and granted the lordship of the Isle of Man. In 1403 Percy turned against Henry IV in favor of Edmund Mortimer, 5th Earl of March, and then conspired with Owen Glendower against King Henry. This rebellion failed at the Battle of Shrewsbury but, since Percy did not directly participate, he lost his office as Constable but was not convicted of treason. But in 1405 Percy supported Richard le Scrope, archbishop of York, in another rebellion, and then Percy fled to Scotland, and his estates were confiscated by the king. In 1408 Percy invaded England and was killed at the Battle of Branham Moor.<br />

Urraca Fernández (died 1007), infanta of Castile and daughter of CountFernán González, was the queen consort of two Kings of León and one Kingof Navarre between 951 and 994. She acted as regent for her son Gonzalo,who had been given the County of Aragon, and later was co-regent of theKingdom of Navarre, along with her daughter-in-law Jimena Fernández andthe bishops of Navarre, of her grandson Sancho III.<br />
 <br />
She was first married by her father to Ordoño III of León in 951. Fernán's support of Sancho the Fat cost her her husband's affection and she was repudiated in 956. By him she had two, and possibly three children:<br />
 <br />
    * Ordoño, who died young<br />
    * Theresa, who became a nun<br />
    * (perhaps) Bermudo II of León, whose maternity is subject to scholarly debate<br />
 <br />
In 958, after Ordoño's death, she was remarried to Ordoño IV. He died in 960.<br />
 <br />
Her third and most important marriage was contracted in 962 to Sancho II of Pamplona. Both Sancho and Urraca were grandchildren of Sancho I of Pamplona, because Urraca's mother was Sancho I's daughter Sancha. With Sancho, she had several children:<br />
 <br />
    * Garćıa Sánchez II of Pamplona<br />
    * Ramiro (died 992)<br />
    * Gonzalo, who ruled the County of Aragon with Urraca as regent<br />
    * Abda (Urraca) the Basque, given to Almanzor before entering a convent<br />

From Wikipedia<br />
 <br />
Sancho II Garcés Abarca of Navarre (aft. 935 - December 994), of the Basque dynasty of Aritza, was King of Pamplona and count of the valley of Aragon from 970 to 994.<br />
 <br />
He was the son of Garćıa Sanchez III and Andregoto Gaĺındez, herself the daughter and heiress of Count Galindo II Aznárez of Aragon.<br />
 <br />
The Historia General de Navarra by Jaime del Burgo says -- referencing in turn the Anales del Reino de Navarra of José de Moret -- that on the occasion of the donation of the villa of Alastue by the king of Pamplona to the monastery of San Juan de la Peña in 987, he titled himself "King of Navarre," the first time that title had been used. In many places he appears as the first King of Aragon and in others the third.<br />
 <br />
He is said to have been the first historical king of this dynasty.<br />
 <br />
The valley of Aragon he had inherited from his mother.<br />
 <br />
He was at least the 6th King of Pamplona, and apparently the 9th.<br />
 <br />
Under Sancho and his immediate successors, Navarre reached the height of its power and its largest size.<br />
 <br />
During this period the kingdoms of Leon and Navarre and the County of Castile were united by familial bonds; the Navarrese monarchy supported the young Ramiro II of Leon.<br />
 <br />
Upon the death of Al-Hakam II in 976 and the succession of his son Hixem II, who had been taught by Almanzor, the prospects of the Christian kingdoms became even worse: the troops of Almanzor defeated the Christians at Torrevicente, south of Soria; afterwards they returned to triumph at Taracueña, near Osma.<br />
 <br />
In 975 Sancho was defeated by the Moors at San Esteban de Gormaz, and in 981 at Rueda, a dozen kilometers from Tordesillas, the Christians suffered another humiliating defeat.<br />
 <br />
Because he could not defeat Almanzor by arms, Sancho went to Córdoba as an ambassador for his own kingdom, bringing many gifts for the victorious Almanzor, making a pact with him and agreeing to give the Muslim his daughter in marriage. From this union was born Abd al-Rahman Sanchuelo, the second successor of lord Almanzor and who tried to usurp the Caliphate of Córdoba from the Umayyad heir.<br />
 <br />
Sancho married Urraca Fernández of Castile around 962, the daughter of count Ferdinand Gonzalez and possibly of Sancha of Pamplona. Before 950 Urraca had been married to Ordono III of Leon de Aza de Najera and in 956 she married his enemy, conqueror and successor Ordono IV of Leon the Bad, from whom she separated. Sancho was the third and last husband.<br />
 <br />
 <br />
Children:<br />
    * Garćıa IV Sanchez "the Trembling", King of Pamplona, who married Jimena Fernández<br />
    * Ramiro of Navarre (d. 992)<br />
    * Gonzalo of Navarre. Some documents list him as count of Aragon. He ruled together with his mother, Urraca, under the dependency of his father.<br />
    * Abda (Urraca) "the Basque" of Navarre, given to Almanzar before entering a convent. Larousse mentions Urraca Teresa of Navarre, married to Ramiro II of Leon and mother of Sancho I "the Fat" "the Crass" of León<br />

Offa (or Alavivaz Olauus) (? - c. 456) was the 4th-great-grandfather ofCreoda of Mercia; he may also be a great-grandson of Odin. He was also a46th-great-grandfather of British Prime Minister Winston Churchill and a42nd-great grandfather of Louis XVII of France. Offa's son was Angeltheow.<br />
 <br />
He was the most famous hero of the early Angli. He is said by the Anglo-Saxon poem Widsith to have ruled over Angel, and the poem refers briefly to his victorious single combat, a story which is related at length by the Danish historians Saxo and Svend Aagesen. Offa (Uffo) is said to have been dumb or silent during his early years, and to have only recovered his speech when his aged father Wermund was threatened by the Saxons, who insolently demanded the cession of his kingdom. Offa undertook to fight against both the Saxon king's son and a chosen champion at once. The combat took place at Rendsburg on an island in the Eider, and Offa succeeded in killing both his opponents. According to Widsith Offa's opponents belonged to a tribe or dynasty called Myrgingas, but both accounts state that he won a great kingdom as the result of his victory. A somewhat corrupt version of the same story is preserved in the Vitae duorum Offarum, where, however, the scene is transferred to England. It is very probable that the Offa whose marriage with a lady of murderous disposition is mentioned in Beowulf is the same person; and this story also appears in the Vitae duorum Offarum, though it is erroneously told of a later Offa of Mercia. Offa of Mercia, however, was a descendant in the iath generation of Offa, king of Angel. It is probable from this and other considerations that the early Offa lived in the latter part of the 4th century.<br />

Angeltheow, also spelled Angletheow, Engengenthe, or Angenwit (? - c.477) was the great-great-great-grandfather of Creoda of Mercia and theson of the first Offa of Mercia.<br />
 <br />
Angeltheow's son was Eomer. According to the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, Angeltheow is a fourth-generation descendant of Woden, the same generation as Hengest and Horsa.<br />
 <br />
It is claimed by some that Angeltheow may also be the Swedish king Ongentheow killed at the Battle of Ravenswood, however the battle took place some time after he is reported to have died, moreover it is unlikely that a British king would have also been able to maintain control over the Geats.<br />

Edmund Crouchback, 1st Earl of Lancaster (January 16, 1245 - June 5,1296) was the second surviving son of Eleanor of Provence and King HenryIII of England.<br />
 <br />
Crouchback was born in London, England. In 1253 he was invested by the Pope in the Kingdom of Sicily and Apulia. At about this time he was also made Earl of Chester. These were of little value as the real King of Sicily was still living and the Earldom of Chester was transferred to his elder brother Edward. Edmund soon obtained, however, important possessions and dignities, for soon after the forfeiture of Simon de Montfort in 1265, Edmund received the Earldom of Leicester and of Lancaster and also the honour of the Stewardship of England and the lands of Nicolas de Segrave.<br />
 <br />
He was married twice, first to Aveline de Forz, Countess of Albemarle, in 1269, and then in Paris, France on February 3, 1276, to Blanche of Artois. That same year he became the Count of Champagne and Brie in France. With Blanche he had four children:<br />
 <br />
    * Thomas Plantagenet, Second Earl of Lancaster (b. 1276)<br />
    * Henry Plantagenet, 3rd Earl of Leicester (b. 1281)<br />
    * John Plantagenet, Lord of Beaufort, (b. BEF 1286)<br />
    * Mary Plantagenet<br />
 <br />
He died on June 5, 1296 in Bayonne, and was interred on July 15, 1296 at Westminster Abbey, London, England.<br />

Francis bought and sold several parcels of landin Sibley County. He bought and sold back several parcels to T. T.Philips. He sold them all his land in 1877.  The family moved to Boise in1878 or 1879.  Births are recorded in Sibley County fro Eliza, Edith andLillian.<br />

Margaret Plantagenet, Margaret of Brotherton, Duchess of Norfolk (c. 1320-March 24, 1398) was Countess of Norfolk from 1338 to 1398. She was the daughter of Thomas of Brotherton, 1st Earl of Norfolk, by his first wife Alice Hayles. She became heiress to the Earldom after the death of her childless brother, Edward, in 1334.<br />
 <br />
She married firstly in 1337 to Sir John de Segrave, 4th Lord Segrave by whom she had four children:<br />
   1. Edmund de Segrave, died in the cradle.<br />
   2. Elizabeth de Segrave (1338-1368)<br />
   3. John de Segrave (September 13, 1340-1349)<br />
   4. Anne de Segrave, Abbess of Barking<br />
 <br />
In 1350, Margaret and John de Segrave began seeking a divorce based on the premise that they were contracted in marriage before she was of age, and that she had never consented to marry him. Furthermore, she had begun a relationship with a knight of great renown, Sir Walter Manny, 1st Baron Manny, as she crossed the channel in October 1350 to meet with him in Calais, without the king's permission. The inquisition regaring this incident shows that Margaret illegally crossed the Channel and met with Manny's servant, who broke his lantern with his foot so she could pass unnoticed.<br />
 <br />
John de Segrave died in 1353, before their divorce could be finalized; the next year Margaret wed Walter Manny shortly before May 30, 1354, and they had two more children:<br />
   1. Thomas Manny, drowned in a well as a boy.<br />
   2. Anne Manny, wife of John Hastings, 2nd Earl of Pembroke<br />
 <br />
Sir Walter died in 1371. Margaret never remarried, and as a widow was created Duchess of Norfolk for life in 1397, even though her grandson Thomas Mowbray, 1st Duke of Norfolk had already succeeded to the honor of Norfolk. Margaret, Duchess of Norfolk, died in 1398 and was buried in the choir of the Grey Friars, London.<br />

 <br />
Arnulf of Montgomery (c. 1068 - 1118/22) was an Anglo-Norman aristocrat, who played a role in the history of England, Wales, and Ireland.<br />
 <br />
He was the youngest son of Roger of Montgomery, 1st Earl of Shrewsbury and Mabel of Bellême.<br />
 <br />
Around 1090 he along with his elder brother Robert built a castle at Pembroke in Wales. In 1093 king William II of England rewarded his efforts with the formal lordship of Pembroke; some historians say that he was in fact created Earl of Pembroke. In any case the lordship was smaller than the later Pembrokeshire.<br />
 <br />
His holdings were greatly expanded in 1096 when Rufus gave him the lordship of Holderness, which in addition to that part of Yorkshire included land in Lincolnshire.<br />
 <br />
It is likely that Arnulf had been designated heir of his brother Hugh of Montgomery, 2nd Earl of Shrewsbury, but after Hugh's death in 1098 Arnulf was outmaneuvered by the eldest brother Robert, who became the 3rd earl of Shrewsbury. This caused some rift between the brothers but nevertheless Hugh participated in their rebellion of 1102 against Henry I of England which caused the loss of all their English and Welsh lands, and their banishment from the kingdom of England.<br />
 <br />
Arnulf turned his attention to Ireland, where not long before he had married Lafrocoth, daughter of the Irish king Muircheartach Ua Briain in about the year 1100, and certainly before 1102, when he is mentioned by Muirchertach as his son-in-law in a letter to the Archbishop of Canterbury Anselm of Bec . Muirchertach provided support for Arnulf's rebellion, and as a result King Henry I of England placed a trade embargo on Ireland. It is suggested by Orderic Vitalis that Arnulf went to Ireland after the rebellion failed and served for Muirchertach Ua Briain, although the Irish Annals make no mention of this.<br />
 <br />
In later years he was in the entourage of count Fulk V of Anjou.<br />

Boleslav II the Pious (died February 7, 999) was the son of Boleslav Ithe Cruel. Boleslav II became Duke (or Prince) of Bohemia in 972.Boleslav maintained good relations with the German Kingdom, and in 975supported Otto II during his civil war against Henry of Bavaria. In 977Boleslav again attacked Bavaria, but on this occasion was barred fromannexing any lands by Otto II.<br />
 <br />
Boleslav's reign is mostly notable for the foundation of the bishopric of Prague in 973. It was placed within the jurisdiction of the Archbishop of Mainz. In 982 Vojtech (later known as Saint Adalbert of Prague) was appointed to this position until in 994 he abandoned his primacy to lead a mission to the Prussians. On April 23, 997 Adalbert was martyred in Prussia near Gdansk. His bones later became the holiest relic of Poland. War between Poland and Bohemia was continual in this period and by 990 Boleslav had occupied Silesia.<br />
 <br />
On September 28, 995 Boleslav stormed Libice in southern Bohemia and massacred the Slavnikovci. This clan had been the main rival of Premyslid power in Bohemia. Boleslav's brutal triumph ensured the unity of Bohemia under a single ruler.<br />

 <br />
Maredudd ap Owain (died 999) was a Prince of Gwynedd and of Deheubarth.<br />
 <br />
Maredydd was the grandson of Hywel Dda. His father, Owain ap Hywel Dda, was king of Deheubarth. As Owain grew too old to lead in battle his son Maredydd took his place, and in 986 captured Gwynedd from Cadwallon ab Ieuaf. On Owain's death in 988 Maredydd also became ruler of Deheubarth. He may have controlled all Wales apart from Gwent and Morgannwg.<br />
 <br />
He is recorded as raiding Mercian settlements on the borders of Radnor and as paying a ransom of one penny a head to rescue some of his subjects who had been taken captive in Viking raids. Danish raids were a constant problem during Maredudd's reign. In 987 Godfrey Haroldson raided Anglesey, killing one thousand and carrying away two thousand as captives. Maredudd died in 999 and was described by the annalists as "the most famous king of the Britons". Following his death, the throne of Gwynedd was recovered for the line of Idwal Foel by Cynan ap Hywel.<br />

Edmund Mortimer, 3rd Earl of March and jure uxoris Earl of Ulster(1351?27 December 1381) was son of Roger Mortimer, 2nd Earl of March, byhis wife Philippa, daughter of William Montacute, 1st Earl of Salisbury.<br />
 <br />
Early Life<br />
Being an infant at the death of his father, Edmund, as a ward of the crown, was placed by Edward III of England under the care of William of Wykeham and Richard Fitzalan, 10th Earl of Arundel.<br />
 <br />
The position of the young earl, powerful on account of his possessions and hereditary influence in the Welsh marches, was rendered still more important by his marriage in 1368 at the age of 17 to the 13 year old Philippa, the only child of Lionel of Antwerp, Duke of Clarence, third son of Edward III.<br />
 <br />
Lionel's wife, Elizabeth, was daughter and heiress of William de Burgh, 6th Lord of Connaught and 3rd Earl of Ulster, and Lionel had himself been created Earl of Ulster before his marriage. Edmund inherited the title Earl of Ulster on Lionel's death.<br />
 <br />
Therefore, the Earl of March not only represented one of the chief Anglo-Norman lordships in Ireland in right of his wife Philippa, but Philippa's line was also the second most senior line of descent in the succession to the crown, after Edward, the Black Prince and his son, King Richard II of England.<br />
 <br />
This marriage had, therefore, far-reaching consequences in English history, ultimately giving rise to the claim of the House of York to the crown of England contested in the Wars of the Roses; Edward IV being descended from the third son of Edward III as great-great-grandson of Philippa, countess of March, and in the male line from Edmund of Langley, fifth son of Edward III.<br />
 <br />
Edmund's son Roger Mortimer, 4th Earl of March would become heir presumptive to the English crown during the reign of Richard II.<br />
 <br />
Political Advancement<br />
Mortimer, now styled Earl of March and Ulster, became Marshal of England in 1369, and was employed in various diplomatic missions during the next following years. He was a member of the committee appointed by the Peers to confer with the Commons in 1373?the first instance of such a joint conference since the institution of representative parliaments on the question of granting supplies for John of Gaunt's war in France.<br />
 <br />
He participated in the opposition to Edward III and the court party, which grew in strength towards the end of the reign, taking the popular side and being prominent in the Good Parliament of 1376 among the lords who supported the Prince of Wales and opposed the Court Party and John of Gaunt. The Speaker of the Commons in this parliament was March's steward, Peter de la Mare, who firmly withstood John of Gaunt in stating the grievances of the Commons, in supporting the impeachment of several high court officials, and in procuring the banishment of the king's mistress, Alice Perrers. March was a member of the administrative council appointed by the same parliament after the death of Edward, the Black Prince to attend the king and advise him in all public affairs.<br />
 <br />
Reign of Richard II<br />
On the accession of Richard II, a minor, in 1377, the Earl became a member of the standing council of government; though as father of the heir-presumptive to the crown he wisely abstained from claiming any actually administrative office. The most powerful person in the realm was, however, John of Gaunt, Duke of Lancaster, whose jealousy of March led to the acceptance by the latter of the Lieutenancy of Ireland in 1379. March succeeded in asserting his authority in eastern Ulster, but failed to subdue the O?Neills farther west. Proceeding to Munster to put down the turbulency of the chieftains of the south, March died at Cork on 27 December 1381, (According Allison Wier in her book Wars of the Roses, Edmund took his job of Lord Lieutenant of Ireland seriously and was trying to restore order when he was ambushed and killed). He was buried in Wigmore Abbey, of which he had been a benefactor, and where his wife Philippa was also interred.<br />
 <br />
The earl had three sons and two daughters, the elder of whom, Elizabeth, married Henry Percy "Hotspur", son of the Earl of Northumberland. His eldest son, Roger, succeeded him as 4th Earl of March and Ulster. His second son, Edmund played an important part, in conjunction with his brother-in-law Hotspur, in the fortunes of Owain Glyndwr. The other daughter was Philippa, who married Richard Fitzalan, 11th Earl of Arundel.<br />

Written 19 June 2011 by William Sundstrom<br />
My dad died today.<br />
Sadly and ironically today is Father's Day.<br />
My mother and father divorced when I was two years old. He always lived far away from me. We would meet a few times each year when he returned to Minnesota for business or on vacation. Despite the distance, I always felt close to dad. I loved him and I knew he loved me. From the age of seven to sixteen, I spent three months every summer with my dad's parents, Anna and Simon. Almost every summer, while at grandpa's farm, my dad would bring his family to the farm for a visit. So, maybe that is why I always felt so close to him.<br />
Those were not the only times that we spent together. Memorable to me was the summer of 1965, when I lived with his family in Montgomery, AL. And the month he spent with me in 1970. We had a good time. He was lots of fun and he got to meet many of my friends. Over the years, I often visited him in Mississippi and I tried to visit for a week or two. In the spring of 2008, I spent a couple of months with him.<br />
I loved the stories my dad would tell. Everyone agrees that you could spin a great yarn. He had stories about friends and family. He had stories about business. He never failed to put me in a good mood when he told a story, even when I had heard it before. When I became a pilot, he would tell me stories about his friends who were pilots. When we traveled we shared stories about travel. And I always enjoyed his stories about his days as a boy in South Dakota. He also had some great stories about business. I especially liked his stories about his business in Japan. He had been a long-time customer of Japanese porcelain, but in the 1980's he started selling container loads of high-quality waterless cookware to the Japanese consumer market.<br />
In recent years, his proudest stories were about Camp Victor in Ocean Springs. He did a lot to help the people of Ocean Springs recover from the Hurricane Katrina. Camp Victor was the Lutheran church's key vehicle to help with the rebuilding of the gulf coast. Camp Victor provided accommodations for thousand of volunteers from all over the USA and Canada. The camp also was a center to receive millions of dollars worth of building materials. Dad played a critical role in the start up and continuation of Camp Victor.<br />
 <br />
My dad loved his family and family stories. Perhaps that is why he became an avid genealogist. He introduced me to his hobby and we shared all of our tricks and methods to find information about our family tree. He also helped reestablish strong contacts with our Swedish cousins. He had visited them and they visited him several times. He often wrote and shared pictures with our cousins in Sweden.<br />
I loved my dad so much. I will greatly miss him.<br />
I wrote a brief obituary for my dad this morning. It follows:<br />
Martin Sidney "Sid" Sundstrom, 84, of Ocean Springs, MS, died early this morning at St. Mary's Hospital in Rochester, MN, from pneumonia contracted during his recovery from heart surgery.<br />
Sid was born 27 June 1926 at the Sundstrom homestead in Brooklyn Township near Beresford, South Dakota, to Simon and Anna (Johansson) Sundstrom.

He enlisted and served in the US Army during World War II. He was wounded while serving in Okinawa. Soon after returning to civilian life, he began a life-long career as salesman and then a sales executive. The career led him and his family to many places, including Indianapolis, Niagara Falls, Chicago, West Bend, Montgomery, Birmingham, and finally in 1970 to Ocean Springs where he lived the rest of his life. Sid was an active member of Christus Victor Lutheran Church. He play a significant role in the establishment of Camp Victor, which has been a leader in the recovery from hurricane Katrina. He was well-known and well-liked in the Ocean Springs community.<br />
Sidney Sundstrom was warm and loving husband, father and grandfather. He will greatly missed by his family and friends and the Ocean Springs community.<br />
Sid Sundstrom married twice. From the first union came his sons, Bill and Brian. Sid married LaVera Isabelle Dulitz at Brownsdale, MN, 30 December 1951. LaVera died in 2006. Sid and LaVera had four children: Katherine, Steven, Dawn and Ann.<br />
Sidney is survived by all his children and their spouses: Bill and Betty; Brian and Judy of Orono, MN; Katherine Sundstrom of Connecticut; Steven and Ellen of La Crosse, WI; Dawn Sundstrom and partner, Mitzi Griffin, of Greensboro, NC; and Ann Tietel of Port Washington, NY. He is survived by eight grandchildren: Aricka, Bjorn, Birgitta, Dain, Edward, Shelby, Belinda and Clara. And he is survived by eight great-grandchildren: Athena, Ebin, Eva, Annika, Johanna, Lucianna, Abbie and Judah. He is survived by his brother Vernon Sundstrom of Madelia, MN, and his sister Elinor Daugherty of New Ulm, MN.<br />
Sidney was preceded in death by his parents, Simon and Anna, and his beloved wife of 55 years, LaVera.<br />

Charlemagne, or Charles the Great, CAROLINGIAN king of the FRANKS, cameto rule over most of Europe and assumed (800) the title of Roman emperor.He is sometimes regarded as the founder of the HOLY ROMAN EMPIRE. In 768he and his brother Carloman inherited the Frankish kingdom (most ofpresent-day France and a part of western Germany) from their father PEPINTHE SHORT. The entire kingdom passed to Charlemagne when Carloman died in771. He inherited great wealth and a strong military organization fromhis father and brother. He used these assets to double the territoryunder Carolingian control. In 772 he opened his offensive against theSAXONS, and for more than three decades he pursued a ruthless policyaimed at subjugating them and converting them to Christianity. Almostevery year Charlemagne attacked one or another region of Saxon territory.--4,500 Saxons were executed on a single day in 782--and deportationswere used to discourage the stubborn. The Saxons proved to be a far moredifficult enemy than any of the other peoples subjugated by Charlemagne.For example, the LOMBARDS were conquered in a single extended campaign773-74), after which Charlemagne assumed the title "king of theLombards." In 788 he absorbed the duchy of Bavaria, and soon thereafterhe launched an offensive against the AVAR empire. The Avars succumbedwithin a decade, yielding Charlemagne a vast hoard of gold and silver.After one disastrous campaign (778) against the Muslims in Spain,Charlemagne left the southwestern front to his son Louis, (later EmperorLOUIS I) who, with the help of local Christian rulers, conqueredBarcelona in 801 and controlled much of Catalonia by 814. On ChristmasDay, 800, Charlemagne accepted the title of emperor and was crowned byPope LEO III. For several years after he regarded the imperial title ofbeing of little value. Moreover, he intended to divide his lands andtitles among his sons, as was the Frankish custom. At his death on Jan.28, 814, however, only one son, Louis, survived; Louis therefore assumedcontrol of the entire Frankish empire.<br />
 <br />
From Wikipedia<br />
 <br />
Charlemagne (c. 742 or 747 - January 28, 814) (or Charles the Great, in German Karl der Groￏe, in Latin Carolus Magnus, giving rise to the adjective form "Carolingian"), was king of the Franks from 771 to 814, King of the Lombards since 774, and the renewer of the Western Empire. His dual role as Emperor - Imperator Augustus - and King of the Franks provides the historical link beetween the Imperial dignity and the Frankish kingdoms and later Germany. Today both France and Germany look unto him as a founding figure of their respective countries.<br />
 <br />
Date of birth<br />
Charlemagne's birthday was believed to be April 1, 742, but several factors led to reconsideration of this traditional date. First, the year 742 was calculated from his age given at death, rather than attested with primary sources. Second, 742 precedes the marriage of his parents (in 744), yet there is no indication that Charlemagne was born out of wedlock, and he inherited from his parents. Another date is given in the Annales Petarienses, the April 2, 747. In that year, April 1 is Easter. The birth of an Emperor on Easter is a coincidence likely to provoke comment, but there is no such comment documented in 747, leading some to suspect the Easter birthday was a pious fiction concocted as a way of honoring the Emperor. Other commentators weighing the primary records have suggested that the birth was one year later, 748. So at present, it is impossible to be certain of the date of the birth of Charlemagne. The best guesses include April 1, 747, after April 15, 747, or April 1, 748.<br />
 <br />
 <br />
Life<br />
Charlemagne was the elder son of Pippin the Younger (714 - September 24, 768, reigned 751 - 768) and his wife Bertrada of Laon (720 - July 12, 783); he was the brother of the Lady Bertha mother of Roland.<br />
Charles, eldest Son of King Pippin, receives the News of the Death of his Father and the Great Feudalists offer him the Crown.--Costumes of the Court of Burgundy in the Fifteenth Century.--Fac-simile of a Miniature of the "History of the Emperors" (Library of the Arsenal).<br />
 <br />
On the death of Pippin the kingdom was divided between Charlemagne and his brother Carloman. Charles took the outer parts of the kingdom, bordering on the sea, namely Neustria, Aquitania]] and the norhtern parts of Austrasia, while Carloman attained the inner parts, bordering on Italy.<br />
 <br />
Carloman died on the 5th of December, 771, leaving Charlemagne the leader of a reunified Frankish kingdom.<br />
 <br />
Shortly after that, he marched against the Lombards in Italy. In 774 he deposed their king Desiderius and was himself crowned king of the Lombards, permanently unifying the kingdom of Italy to the Frankish crown.<br />
 <br />
Charlemagne was engaged in almost constant battle throughout his reign. After thirty years of war and 18 battles, he conquered Saxony, a goal that had been the unattainable dream of Augustus, and proceeded to convert the conquered to Catholic Christianity, using force where necessary. He dreamed of the reconquest of Spain, but never fully succeeded in this goal.<br />
 <br />
In 797 (801?) the caliph of Baghdad, Harun al-Rashid, gave Emperor Charlemagne the first historically recorded elephant in northern Europe, named Abul-Abbas, an Asian elephant. (See History of elephants in Europe.)<br />
 <br />
In 800, at Mass on Christmas day in Rome, Pope Leo III crowned Charlemagne Imperator Romanorum (Emperor of the Romans). Though this, according to the sources, occured against his intentions, Charles thus became the renewer of the Western Empire, that had expired in the 5th century. To avoid frictions with the Eastern Emperor, Charles later called himself not Imperator Romanorum (a title reserved for the Eastern Emperor), but rather as Imperator Romanum gubernans Imperium (Emperor ruling the Roman Empire).<br />
 <br />
Pursuing his father's reforms, Charlemagne did away with the monetary system based on the gold sou. Both he and King Offa of Mercia took up the system set in place by Pippin. He set up a new standard, the livre (i.e. pound)- both monetary and unit of weight- which was worth 20 sous (like the solidus, and later the shilling) or 240 deniers (like the denari, and eventually the penny). During this period, the livre and the sou were counting units, only the denier was a coin of the realm.<br />
 <br />
Charlemagne applied the system to much of the European Continent, and Offa's standard was voluntarily adopted by much of England.<br />
 <br />
Charlemagne organized his empire into 350 counties, each led by an appointed count. Counts served as judges, administrators, and enforced capitularies. To enforce loyalty, he set up the system of Missi Dominici, meaning 'Envoys of the Lord.' In this system, one representative of the church and one representative of the emperor would head to the different counties and every year report back to Charlemagne on their status.<br />
 <br />
When Charlemagne died in 814, he was buried in his own Cathedral at Aachen. He was succeeded by his only son to survive him, Louis the Pious, after whose reign the empire was divided between his three surviving sons according to Frankish tradition. These three kingdoms would be the foundations of later France and the Holy Roman Empire.<br />
 <br />
After Charlemagne's death, continental coinage degraded and most of Europe resorted to using the continued high quality English coin until about 1100.<br />
 <br />
It is difficult to understand Charlemagne's attitude toward his daughters. None of them contracted a sacramental marriage. This may have been an attempt to control the number of potential alliances. After his death the surviving daughters entered or were forced to enter monasteries. At least one of them, Bertha, had a recognized relationship, if not a marriage, with Angilbert, a member of Charlemagne's court circle.<br />
 <br />
Charlemagne's mother tongue was the Old High German dialect called Frankish. He also spoke Latin and understood some Greek.<br />
 <br />
Cultural significance<br />
harlemagne's reign is often referred to as the Carolingian Renaissance because of the flowering of scholarship, literature, art and architecture. Most of the surviving works of classical Latin were copied and preserved by Carolingian scholars. The pan-European nature of Charlemagne's influence is indicated by the origins of many of the men who worked for him: Alcuin, an Anglo-Saxon; Theodulf, a Visigoth; Paul the Deacon, a Lombard; and Angilbert and Einhard, Franks. Charlemagne enjoyed an important afterlife in European culture. One of the great medieval literature cycles, the Charlemagne cycle or Matter of France, centres around the deeds of Charlemagne's historical commander of the Breton border, Roland, and the paladins who served as a counterpart to the knights of the Round Table; their tales were first told in the chansons de geste. Charlemagne himself was accorded sainthood inside the Holy Roman Empire after the 12th Century. His canonization by Antipope Paschal III was never recognized by the Holy See. He was a model knight as one of the Nine Worthies.<br />
 <br />
It is frequently claimed by genealogists that all people with European ancestry alive today are probably descended from Charlemagne. However, only a small percentage can actually prove descent from him. Charlemagne's marriage and relationship politics and ethics did, however, result in a fairly large number of descendants, all of whom had far better life expectancies than is usually the case for children in that time period. They were married into houses of nobility and as a result of intermarriages many people of noble descent can indeed trace their ancestry back to Charlemagne.<br />
 <br />
Another interesting note about Charlemagne was that he took a serious effort in his and others' scholarship and had learned to read in his adulthood, although he never quite learned how to write. This was quite an achievement for kings at this time, of whom most were illiterate.<br />

Pippin of Italy (April, 773 - July 8, 810) was the third son of Charlemagne, and the second with his wife Hildegard of Savoy. He was born Carloman, but when his brother Pippin the Hunchback betrayed their father, the royal name Pippin passed to him. He was made king of Italy at after his father's conquest of the Lombards in 781. He was crowned King by Pope Hadrian I.<br />
 <br />
He was active as ruler of Italy and worked to expand the Frankish empire. This included a long, but unsuccessful siege of Venice in 810. The siege lasted six months and Pippin's army was ravaged by the diseases of the local swamps and was forced to withdraw. A few months later Pippin died.<br />
 <br />
He married Bertha of Toulouse and had five daughters with her: Adelheid, Atala, Gundrada, Berthais, and Tetrada. He also had an illegitimate son Bernard. Pippin was expected to inherit a third of his father's empire, but Pippin died before him. The Italian crown passed on to his son Bernard, but the empire went to Pippin's younger brother Louis the Pious.<br />

 <br />
Louis the German (also known as Louis II) (804 - September 28, 876), the third son of the emperor Louis the Pious and his first wife, Irmengarde, was ruler of Eastern Francia from 817 until his death.<br />
 <br />
His early years were partly spent at the court of his grandfather, Charlemagne, whose special affection he is said to have won. When the emperor Louis divided his dominions between his sons in 817, Louis received Bavaria and the neighbouring lands, but did not undertake the government until 825, when he became involved in war with the Wends and Sorbs on his eastern frontier. In 827 he married Emma, sister of his stepmother Judith, and daughter of Welf I, whose possessions ranged from Alsace to Bavaria. Louis soon began to interfere in the quarrels arising from Judith's efforts to secure a kingdom for her own son Charles (later known as Charles the Bald), and the consequent struggles of Louis and his brothers with the emperor Louis I.<br />
 <br />
When the elder Louis died in 840 and his eldest son Lothar claimed the whole Empire, Louis allied with his half-brother, (now) king Charles the Bald, and defeated Lothar at Fontenoy in June 841. In June 842, the three brothers met on an island in the Saone to negotiate a peace, and each appointed forty representatives to arrange the boundaries of their respective kingdoms. This developed into the Treaty of Verdun concluded in August 843, by which Louis received the bulk of the lands of the Carolingian empire lying east of the Rhine, together with a district around Speyer, Worms and Mainz, on the left bank of the river. His territories included Bavaria, where he made Regensburg the centre of his government, Thuringia, Franconia and Saxony. He may truly be called the founder of the German kingdom, though his attempts to maintain the unity of the Empire proved futile. Having in 842 crushed a rising in Saxony, he compelled the Obotrites to own his authority, and undertook campaigns against the Bohemians, the Moravians and other tribes, but was not very successful in freeing his shores from the ravages of Danish pirates.<br />
 <br />
At his instance, synods and assemblies were held where laws were decreed for the better government of church and state. In 853 and the following years, Louis made more than one attempt to secure the throne of Aquitaine, which, according to the Annals of the Abbey of Fulda (Annales Fuldensis), the people of that country offered him in their disgust with the cruel misrule of Charles the Bald. Encouraged by his nephews Pepin II of Aquitaine and Charles of Provence, Louis invaded; Charles the Bald could not even raise an army to resist the invasion, and in 858 Louis issued a charter dated "the first year of the reign in West Francia." Treachery and desertion in his army, and the loyalty to Charles of the Aquitanian bishops brought about the failure of the enterprise, which Louis renounced by a treaty signed at Coblenz on June 7, 860.<br />
 <br />
In 855 the emperor Lothair died, and Louis and Charles for a time seem to have cooperated in plans to divide Lothar's possessions among themselves -- the only impediments to this being Lothar's sons, Lothar II, Louis II, and Charles of Provence. In 863 on the death of Charles, they divided Provence and Burgundy between them. In 868 at Metz they agreed definitely to a partition; but when Lothar II died in 869, Louis the German was lying seriously ill, and his armies were engaged with the Moravians. Charles the Bald accordingly seized the whole kingdom; but Louis the German, having recovered, compelled him by a threat of war to agree to the treaty of Mersen, which divided it between the claimants.<br />
 <br />
The later years of Louis the German were troubled by risings on the part of his sons, the eldest of whom, Carloman, revolted in 861 and again two years later; an example that was followed by the second son Louis, who in a further rising was joined by his brother Charles. A report that the emperor Louis II was dead led to peace between father and sons and attempts by Louis the German to gain the imperial crown for Carloman. These efforts were thwarted by Louis II, who was not in fact dead, and his uncle, Charles the Bald.<br />
 <br />
Louis was preparing for war when he died on September 28, 876 at Frankfurt. He was buried at the abbey of Lorsch, leaving three sons and three daughters. Louis is considered by many to be the most competent of the descendants of Charlemagne. He obtained for his kingdom a certain degree of security in face of the attacks of Normans, Hungarians, Moravians and others. He lived in close alliance with the Church, to which he was very generous, and entered eagerly into schemes for the conversion of his heathen neighbours.<br />

Louis VIII the Lion (French: Louis VIII le Lion) (September 5, 1187 - November 8, 1226) reigned as King of France from 1223 to 1226. He was a member of the Capetian dynasty. Louis was born in Paris, France, the son of King Philippe II Auguste and Isabelle of Hainaut.<br />
 <br />
As a prince, Louis won battles against the armies of King John of England. In 1216 the English barons rebelled against the very unpopular King John and offered the throne to Louis. In May of 1216, Prince Louis of France and his army invaded England in what has become known as the First Barons' War, but after a year and a half of war, Louis had to give up on his desire to become the King of England and signed the Treaty of Lambeth.<br />
 <br />
Louis succeeded his father on July 14, 1223; his coronation took place on August 6 of the same year in the cathedral at Reims. As king, he continued to seek revenge on the Angevins and seized Poitiers and Saintonge from them in 1224. There followed the seizure of Avignon and Languedoc.<br />
 <br />
On 1 November 1223, he issued an ordinance that prohibited his officials from recording debts owed to Jews, thus reversing the policies set by his father King Philippe II Auguste. Usury (lending money with interest) was illegal for Christians to practice, according to Church law it was seen as a vice to profit from others misfortune (like gambling), and was punishable by excommunication, a severe punishment. However since Jews were not Christian, they could not be excommunicated, and thus fell in to a legal gray area which secular rulers would sometimes exploit by allowing (or requesting) Jews to provide usuary services, often for personal gain to the secular ruler, and to the discontent of the Church. Louis' prohibition was one attempt at resolving this legal problem which was a constant source of friction in Church and State courts.<br />
 <br />
Twenty six barons accepted, but Thibaut IV, a powerful baron from Champagne did not, since he had an agreement with the Jews that guaranteed him extra income through taxation. Thibaut IV would become a major opposition force to Capetian dominance, and his hostility was manifest during the reign of Louis VIII. For example, during the siege of Avignon, he peformed only the minimum service of 40 days, and left home amid charges of treachery.<br />
 <br />
While returning to Paris, King Louis became ill with dysentery, and died on November 8, 1226 in the chateau at Montpensier, Auvergne.<br />
 <br />
The Saint Denis Basilica houses the tomb of Louis VIII. His son, Louis IX, succeeded him on the throne.<br />
 <br />
Marriage<br />
On May 23, 1200, at the age of twelve, Louis married Blanche of Castile (March 4, 1188 - November 26, 1252).<br />

He was victor over the Saracens at Tours, Poitiers, in 732.<br />
 <br />
Carolingian ruler of the Frankish kingdom of Austrasia (in present northeastern France and southwestern Germany). Charles, whose surname means the hammer, was the son of Pepin of Herstal and the grandfather of Charlemagne. Pepin was mayor of the palace under the last kings of the Merovingian dynasty. When he died in 714, Charles, an illegitimate son, was imprisoned by his father's widow, but he escaped in 715 and was proclaimed mayor of the palace by the Austrasians. A war between Austrasia and the Frankish kingdom of Neustria (now part of France) followed, and at the end of it Charles became the undisputed ruler of all the Franks. Although he was engaged in wars against the Alamanni, Bavarians, and Saxons, his greatest achievements were against the Muslims from Spain, who invaded France in 732. Charles defeated them near Poitiers in a great battle in which the Muslim leader, Abd-ar-Rahman, the emir of Spain, was killed. The progress of Islam, which had filled all Christendom with alarm, was thus checked for a time. Charles drove the Muslims out of the Rhone valley in 739, when they had again advanced into France as far as Lyon, leaving them nothing of their possessions north of the Pyrenees beyond the Aude River. Charles died in Quierzy, on the Oise River, leaving the kingdom divided between his two sons, Carloman (circa 715-54) and Pepin the Short.<br />

Born: in 686 in Chateau de Franchemont, Belgium, son of Pepin II d'Heristal and Aupais=Alpaide N? , The Chateau de Franchemont is near Spa and also Verviers, which may have encompassed Heristal. During World War II, the resistance used the tunnels under the castle to hide people and supplies from the German hordes.<br />
 <br />
Married before 715: Rotrude=Chrotrud, Duchesse d'Austrasie , daughter of Saint Lievin=Leutwinus, Bishop de Treves and N. d'Istrie. Note - between 715 and 741: Toward the end of 715, Charles escaped from the prison his step-grandmother had locked him in, and rallies the Austrasians. In March, 716, however, in his first conflict with the Frisons who were edging their way up the Rhine, Charles is routed. A few weeks later, he is able to beat the Neustrians on the Ambeve River, near Malmedy. on 21 March 717, he is victorious over the Neustrians again, this time at Vincy, near Cambrai and he forces Chilperic II and his Mayor of the Palace, Rainfroi to flee to Paris. In 714, Charles takes the title Mayor of the Palace of Neustria, and gives the Neustrians a new King, Clotaire IV, son of Thierry III [who had died in 691] . The same year, his armies ravage Saxe all the way to the Weser River. In early 719, Clotaire IV died, and Rainfroi and Chilperic II obtain the assistance of Eudes, Duke of Aquitaine in a campaign against Charles. Charles defeats both armies; however, since Clotaire IV is dead, Charles recognizes Chilperic, but he becomes the Major Domus of both Neustria and Austrasia. When Chilperic II died in 721, Charles pulled Thierry IV, young adolescent son of Dagobert III, out of the Monastery of Chelles. from 722 to 724, the arabs mount successful offensives and pillage Autun. Charles, worried about maintaining the Franc authority, Charles Martel mounts a frightfully succesful campaign in Bavaria against the Allemanians and the Frisons, and he destroys their temples. Theutbald, Duke of the Allemanians is essentially powerless. In Gaule, toward the end of the decade, Charles turns his attention to Eudes, Duke of Aquitaine, who had maintained too independent an attitude. Aquitaine is ravaged in the process. In 730, Eudes allies himself with an Emir of northern Spain, Othmann ben Abi-Nessa and the arabs agin a foothold in southern France. By 732, a new emir, Adb-el-Rahman invades from Pampelona, cross the Pyrenees near Roncevaux, take and pillage Bordeaux, burning all the churches. In the Summer, they take Poitiers and destroy the basilica of Saint-Hilaire-hors-les-murs. On Saturday 17 October 732, Charles Martel's armies take the great Roman way linking Chatellerault to Poitiers and at 20 km North of Poitiers, at Moussais-la-Bataille, it encounters the arabs. They would observe each other for 7 days before the Battle of Poitiers would take place.<br />
 <br />
The Battle of Poitiers: One Chronicler, Fredegaire described the action as follows: "Duke Eudes, being viewed with derision throughout his lands, called against Prince Charles and the nation of the Francs, that most perfidious race of the Sarrasins [that is not accurate as Eudes had first allied himself with an Emir, but then called upon Charles for aid when events turned on him] . The Sarrasins, led by their King, Abd-el-Rahman cross Gerona [another error as they set out from Pampelona and crossed the pyrenees at Roncevaux] . After having burned the churches, and crushed the population, they arrive in Poitiers. When they burn the Basilica and destroy the residence of Saint Martin, Prince Charles put into action an audacious plan and the order of Battle is given. With the aid of Jesus Christ, our Lord, our valorous Prince destroys their tents and flies into combat to crush them..."<br />
 <br />
A less glorious account is given by a monk of the Abbey of Moissac:<br />
 <br />
"The King of Spain, Abd-el-Rahman, having crossed the Pyrenees with his large army from Pampelona, laid siege to Bordeaux. Then Eudes, Prince of Aquitaine, leading his large assembled army fought against the Sarrasins on the banks of the Garonne. But, from the beginning, the Sarrasins were victorious. Eudes, having to flee, recruited the assistance of Charles, Prince of the Francs. Then Charles led his armies and combat ensued in the suburbs of Poitiers [the actual battle took place 20 km North of Poitiers] . The Sarrasins having been beaten by the Francs, and their King, Abd-el-Rahman killed, fled in a most disorderly manner back to Spain. As to Charles, he returned triumphantly to France with the bounty..."<br />
 <br />
The Moslems have named that field of Battle: Balad-al-Shouhada -- Place of the Martyrs of the Faith. This victory gave Charles Martel extraordinary prestige, and it is there that he is said to have crushed the arabs "like a hammer". He then occupied the Bourgogne (Burgundy) and pacified the Languedoc, and Provence, thus establishing a significant French Monarchy. He exiled the family of Eucharic of Orleans, who controlled the bishopric of Auxerre, to Hesbaye, and installed his own man, Aimar to the Holy See. Married before 726: Sunnichild de Baviere. Buried: in Oct 741 in Saint Denis, Seine, Ile-de-France, France. Died: on 22 Oct 741 in Kiersy=Quierzy, Aisne, France, Upon Charles Martel's death, his two sons divide the Kingdom in accordance with his wishes. Carloman gets Austrasia, Allemania and Thuringia; Pepin gets Neustria, Burgundy and Provence. The rest, very little, went to Grifon, a bastard child of Charles by Swannhilde, grand-daughter of the Duke of the Bavarians.<br />

From Wikipedia<br />
 <br />
Charles Martel (Charles "the Hammer", German: Karl Martell) (August 23, 686 - October 22, 741) was born in Herstal, in what is now Wallonia, Belgium, the illegitimate son of Pippin the Middle (635 or 640 - December 16, 714) and his concubine Alpaida or Chalpaida.<br />
 <br />
Although he was Mayor of the Palace of the kingdom of the Franks, Martel (Martel means "the Hammer") is best remembered for winning the Battle of Tours in 732, which has been characterized as the salvation of Europe from the Arabs spreading their empire further than the Iberian Peninsula. Martel's Frankish army defeated an Arab army, which had swept through southern Asia and north Africa, before conquering most of the Iberian peninsula and much of southern France. Martel achieved lasting greatness by inspiring his Franks to do what was thought to be impossible.<br />
 <br />
It was this battle that earned Charles the cognomen "Martel," for the merciless way he smote his enemies. Most historians believe that had he failed at Tours, Islam would probably have overrun Europe.<br />
 <br />
The Battle of Tours probably took place somewhere between Tours and Poitiers. The Frankish army, under Charles Martel, consisted of veteran infantry, somewhere between 15,000 and 75,000. Responding to the Muslim invasion, the Franks had marched over the mountains and avoided the old Roman roads, hoping to take the invaders by surprise. From the old Arab accounts of the battle, the Muslims were indeed taken by surprise to find a large force opposing their sack of Tours, and waited for six days, scouting the enemy. On the seventh day, the Muslim army, consisting of between 60-400,000 horsemen and led by Emir Abd er Rahman, attacked. During the battle, the Franks defeated the Islamic army and Emir Abd er Rahman was killed. While western accounts are sketchy, Arab accounts are fairly detailed that the Franks formed a large square and fought a brilliant defensive battle. Rahman had doubts before the battle that his men were ready for such a struggle, and should have had them abandon the loot which hindered them, but instead decided to trust his horsemen, who had never failed him. Indeed, as previously noted, it was thought impossible for infantry of that age to withstand armoured mounted warriors. Martel managed to inspire his men to stand firm against a force which must have seemed invincible to them, huge armoured horsemen, who in addition probably badly outnumbered the Franks. But Rahman's death led to bickering between the surviving generals, and the Arabs abandoned the battlefield the day after his death, leaving Martel a unique place in history as the savior of Europe, and the only man to ever manage such a victory between such disparate forces.<br />
 <br />
Although it took another two generations for the Franks to drive all the Arab garrisons out of what is now France and across the Pyrenees, Charles Martel's halt of the invasion of French soil turned the tide of Islamic advance, and the unification of the Frankish kingdom under Charles Martel, his son Pippin the Younger, and his grandson Charlemagne prevented the Umayyad kingdom from expanding over the Pyrenees.<br />
 <br />
On Pippin the Middle's death in 714, the succession passed to an infant grandson, Theodoald. The faction of Austrasian nobles who supported Theodoald was led by his stepmother, Pippin's widow, Plectrude. Charles, who was already an adult, led a rival faction and prevailed in a series of battles against both invading Neustrian Franks and the forces of Plectrude. Between 718 and 723, Charles secured his power through a series of victories and by winning the loyalty of several important clerics. This he accomplished in part by donating lands and money for the foundations of abbeys such as Echternach.<br />
 <br />
In the subsequent decade, Charles led the Frankish army against the eastern duchies, Bavaria and Alemannia, and the southern duchies, Aquitaine and Provence (in Avignon, N̂ımes, Montfrin (736), ...). He dealt with the ongoing conflict with the Saxons to his northeast with some success, but full conquest of the Saxons and their incorporation into the Frankish empire would wait for his grandson Charlemagne.<br />

Pippin the Younger (714 - September 24, 768) often known under themistranslation Pippin the Short (French, Pépin le Bref; German, Pippinder Kleine), was a King of the Franks (751 - 768).<br />
 <br />
He was born in 714 in Jupille, in what is today part of Belgium, but then a part of the kingdom of Austrasia. His father was Charles Martel, Mayor of the Austrasian Palace, and his mother was Chrotrud (690-724).<br />
 <br />
In 740 Pippin married Bertrada of Laon. Of their children, two sons and one daughter survived to adulthood.<br />
    * Charles / Charlemagne (April 2, 747 - January 28, 814)<br />
    * Carloman (751 - December 4, 771)<br />
    * Redburga<br />
 <br />
On the death of Pippin's father, Charles Martel, in 741, power was passed down to Charles' legimitate sons, Pippin and Carloman. Power may also have been intended for Charles' illegitimate son, Grifo, but he was imprisoned in a monastery by his two half-brothers. Carloman, who by all evidence was a deeply pious man, retired to a monastery in 747. This left France in the hands of Pippin as mayor for the Merovingian King Childeric III. Childeric had the title of King but Pippin had control over orders and actually had the power of the king. Pippin then went to ask the Pope who should be complete ruler; the person with the title of king, or the person who makes the decisions of king. The Pope agreed that the decision making was more important than the title. He succeeded in obtaining the support of the papacy, which helped to discourage opposition. He was elected King of the Franks by an assembly of the Frankish leading-men and anointed at Soissons, perhaps by Boniface, Archbishop of Mainz.<br />
 <br />
During his reign, Pippin's conquests gave him more power than anyone since the days of King Clovis. He added to that power after Pope Stephen II traveled all the way to Paris to anoint King Pippin in a lavish ceremony at Saint Denis Basilica, bestowing upon him the additional title of Patrician of the Romans. As life expectancies were short in those days, and Pippin wanted family continuity, the Pope also anointed Pippin's sons, Charles (eventually known as Charlemagne) and Carloman.<br />
 <br />
Pippin's first major act was to go to war against the Lombard king Aistulf as a partial repayment for papal support in his quest for the crown. Victorious, he forced the Lombard king to return property seized from the church. In 759, he drove the Saracens out of France with the capture of Narbonne and then consolidated his power further by making Aquitaine a part of his kingdom.<br />
 <br />
Pippin died at Saint Denis in 768 and is interred there in the Saint Denis Basilica with his wife Bertrada.<br />

Gruffydd ap Llywelyn (c. 1200-March 1, 1244) was the eldest, illegitimate son of Llywelyn the Great. Under Welsh law, he might reasonably have expected to succeed his father, but Llywelyn had married a daughter of King John, and preferred his legitimate son, Dafydd, who was obliged to imprison his half-brother in order to secure his own inheritance. Following a successful invasion of the Welsh borders by King Henry III of England in 1241, the king took Gruffydd into custody. The headstrong and impatient Gruffydd fell to his death while attempting to escape from the Tower of London. This was the second time Gruffydd had found himself in English custody. As a boy, he had been one of the hostages taken by King John as a pledge for his father's good faith. One of the reasons for his shoddy treatment was that he presented a threat to his half-brother, Dafydd, who was half-English. Moreover, Gruffydd being a bastard in English eyes, it would be a bad precedent if he were allowed to inherit Gwynedd.<br />
 <br />
After his death, however, Gruffydd's four sons-Owain, Llywelyn, Dafydd and Rhodri-would come into their own, and, after much fraternal discord, Llywelyn ended up ruling most of Wales.<br />

Fern Fleagle worked as a nurse and educator for 38 years at Mercy and Unity Hospitals<br />
by Kelly Johnson, Staff writer<br />
There was never any question what Fern Fleagle wanted to do with her life.<br />
Nursing has been a calling for the Coon Rapids resident for as long as she can remember.<br />
"It was just something I always wanted to do," Fleagle said.<br />
But, after 38 years of work at Mercy and Unity Hospitals, Fleagle has finally decided to retire.<br />
"It was just time," Fleagle said about the decision.<br />
A move to Coon Rapids in 1960 brought Fleagle to Mercy Hospital.<br />
Before coming to Mercy and Unity Hospitals, Fleagle worked at the University of Minnesota and for Glenwood Hills.<br />
But she spent the bulk of her career working at the Coon Rapids and Fridley hospitals.<br />
"The hospital's a good place to work," Fleagle said about Mercy Hospital.<br />
Fleagle started working part-time as a nurse on the surgical floor at night.<br />
As her children grew, Fleagle added more hours to her schedule and worked different shifts.<br />
In 1978, Fleagle switched from nursing to working as a nurse educator.<br />
There, she handled orientation and patient and staff education programs.<br />
While she enjoyed the work, she found she missed having direct contact with patients.<br />
"You get almost an instant gratification from patients," Fleagle said.<br />
But, she found education rewarding in other ways.<br />
"I liked preparing people to do their jobs the best they can," Fleagle said.<br />
Fleagle is not leaving Mercy and Unity Hospitals empty-handed - she is taking years of good memories with her.<br />
"It's been a very rewarding career for me," Fleagle said. "It's been more than a career. It's been my life."<br />
"I've just been so blessed."<br />
While she doesn't have any specific plans for retirement, Fleagle hopes to spend more of her time doing volunteer work.<br />
"I don't just want to stay home," she said. "I want to do something for people."<br />
Fleagle's last official day working at the two hospitals was Feb. 4.<br />
A retirement tea was held in Fleagle's honor Feb. 18, at Mercy Hospital.<br />

Eleanor de Montfort, Princess of Wales and Lady of Snowdon (1252 - 19June 1282) was a daughter of Simon de Montfort, 6th Earl of Leicester andEleanor of England. She was also the first woman who can be shown to haveused the title Princess of Wales.<br />
 <br />
Early life<br />
Eleanor's maternal grandparents were John of England and his queen consort Isabella of Angoulême. Her maternal uncles included Henry III of England and Richard, 1st Earl of Cornwall. Her maternal aunts included Joan of England, Queen of Scotland, and Isabella of England, and Joan, Lady of Wales.<br />
 <br />
When Eleanor was thirteen years old, her father Earl Simon and brother Lord Henry were killed at the Battle of Evesham (4 August 1265). According to the chroniclers, Nicholas Trivet, William Rishanger and others, Earl Simon had earlier made an alliance with Llywelyn ap Gruffudd, whereby it was agreed that Llywelyn and Eleanor would marry. After Earl Simon's death, his family was forced to flee the Kingdom of England: Countess Eleanor took her daughter to the safety of the Dominican nunnery at Montargis, France, a Montfort foundation.<br />
 <br />
Marriage to Llywelyn ap Gruffydd<br />
Countess Eleanor died in Spring 1275, and shortly afterwards Llywelyn ap Gruffudd, the Prince of Wales, and Eleanor de Montfort married by proxy, (per nuncios) per verba de presenti (Canon law endorsed a marital bond that was made in this way, with the full consent of both of the individuals, before witnesses).<br />
 <br />
Capture and imprisonment by Edward I<br />
Eleanor began the sea voyage from France to north Wales, avoiding making a land passage through England. The two ships carrying Eleanor, her brother Amaury and their entourage, sailing off the south coast of England, were captured by sailors from the port of Bristol, just off the Isles of Scilly. Six named men together with the crews of four ships of Bristol were rewarded with a payment of 220 marks. 'Thomas Larchdeacon', 'Thomas the Archdeacon', who masterminded the capture on behalf of her first cousin Edward I of England was paid £20 in May 1276 by the king's orders, through the sheriff of Cornwall. (Calendar of Close Rolls, 1272-79, 292).<br />
 <br />
Eleanor was taken by ship to Bristol, then held prisoner at Windsor for nearly three years. In 1278, following the signing of the Treaty of Aberconwy, she was released.<br />
 <br />
Married life<br />
Eleanor and Llywelyn were formally married (secundum formam ecclesie) at the cathedral door, as was the custom, of the cathedral church at Worcester, on the Feast Day of St Edward, 1278; Edward gave the bride, his cousin, away and paid for the wedding feast. Before the wedding mass was celebrated, Edward insisted that Llywelyn should put his seal to an adjustment to the agreement that they had previously made. Llywelyn had no alternative but to comply, and he later stated that he did it under duress, 'moved by the fear that can grip a steadfast man' (see Registrum Epistolarum Fratis Johannis Peckham Archiepiscopi Cantuariensis, Lambeth Palace Archives).<br />
 <br />
Following the ceremony, Eleanor became officially known as Princess of Wales and Lady of Snowdon. (see Calendar of Patent Rolls, 1272-81, 306; CPR, 1281-92, 11; Calendar of Ancient Correspondence, 75-76; Foedera I, ii, 576, 584, 587).<br />
 <br />
Death and legacy<br />
Eleanor died in childbirth on 19 June 1282 (see The chronicle of Bury St Edmunds, 74-76) at the royal home Abergwyngregyn, on the north coast of Gwynedd; her body was carried across the Lafan Sands to the Franciscan Friary of Llanfaes, Anglesey. The Friary, on the opposite shore of the Menai to Abergwyngregyn, had been founded by Llywelyn Fawr, the grandfather of Llywelyn ap Gruffudd, in memory of his wife Joan.<br />
 <br />
On 12 July 1282, members of Eleanor's personal household were given 'safe-conduct' to travel to England.<br />
 <br />
Llywelyn was killed on 11 December 1282. The child, Gwenllian of Wales, was captured the following year by the armies of King Edward I of England, and taken to be held at Sempringham Priory in Lincolnshire.<br />

Carolingian mayor of the palace, who reunited the Frankish realms in thelate Merovingian period. A grandson of Pepin the Elder, he succeeded tohis position in the kingdom of Austrasia around 680. In 687 he extendedCarolingian rule to the other Frankish kingdoms, Neustria and Burgundy,but retained members of the Merovingian dynasty as figurehead monarchs inall three. Two years later he extended his control over the Frisians, apagan people living on the North Sea coast. Pepin's death was followed bya civil war and the succession of his illegitimate son Charles Martel.<br />

Born: circa 635 in Liege, Luik, Liege, Belgium, son of Ansegis=Ansegisus, Duke d'Austrasie and Sainte Begge=Begga de Landen . Note - between 679 and 714: The services of the Palace were ensured by the Greats [nobles] , known as "Optimates", frequently brought up at a very young age within the King's entourage. Because the Canerarii's task was to watch over the King's chamber and the precious treasure kept in it, it was logical that he should be given financial attributes. Since the eldest officer was the seneschal [senescallus] he was given the task of overseeing the army. The Comes Stabuli' job was to watch over the King's stables. There were others based on various tasks. The most singular office was that of Major Domus, frequently called Mayor of the Palace. Originally, this was only an attendant whose job was to maintain appropriate levels of stocks and supplies, and to coordinate the activities of other personnel in the King's palace. In early 679, Dagobert II, who had returned form an exile in Ireland, attempted to govern Austrasia with the help of his Mayor of the Palace, Goufaud. The Greats prefer Pepin II, grand-son of Pepin de Landen. By the end of 679, Dagobert II is killed in a hunting "accident". Pepin II was the Mayor-of-the-Palace of Austrasie from 679 to 714. In 680, Ebroin and Thierry III of Neustria fight and force Pepin II to flee at Leucofao, near Bois-du-Fay in the Ardennes. When Pepin II recognizes Thierry III as the only King of Gaule, the war between the two is suspended for about 3 years. At Tertry three leagues from Saint-Quentin, Pepin II fought and beat Thierri III, King of Neustrie and in 687 took that kingdom. It is at that time that he begins to be known as Pepin de Herstal or d'Heristal. It is also clear that by that time, the office of Major Domus had become essentially hereditary and that it grew in power as that of the King's declined. Pepin II directed a number of expeditions against the Frisons [defeating Duke Radbod in 689 and sending them Willibrod to convert them to Christianity] , the Alamanians [whom he defeats near Lake Constance in 690] and the Bavarois [who submitted to Pepin II in 691] . When Norbert, Mayor of Neustria and of Burgundy died [whom Pepin II had designated in 688] , circa 700, Pepin installed his own son, Grimoald=Grimaud. Married before 685: Plectrud d'Echternach, daughter of Hugobert=Humbert d'Echternach and Irmina. Married before 686: Aupais=Alpaide. Historians recognize Alpais as Pepin II's one concubine, which seems rather modest for a personage of his status at that time. Died: on 16 Dec 714 in Jupile-sur-Meuse, Belgium.<br />

From Wikipedia<br />
 <br />
Pippin of Herstal (Fr. Pépin), also known as Pippin the Middle, (b. 635 or 640 - December 16, 714).<br />
 <br />
He was the grandson of Pippin the Elder from the marriage of Ansegisel and Begga, the daughter of the Elder. As the Mayor of the Palace of Austrasia, Neustria and Burgundy from 680 to 714, he gradually controlled the Frankish court. The Merovingian king Theuderic III attempted to oust Pepin from his post, but he was defeated at Tertry in 687. Pepin then became the actual ruler of Austrasia, keeping a strong influence over the other Frankish kingdoms. His descendants continued to serve as Mayors of the Palace, eventually becoming the legal rulers of the Frankish kingdoms.<br />
 <br />
Around 670, Pippin married Plectrude for her inheritance of substantial estates in the Moselle region. They produced at least two children and through them at least two significant grandchildren. These legitimate children and grandchildren claimed themselves to be Pepin's true successors and with the help of his widow Plectrude tried to maintain the position of Mayor of the Palace after Pippin's death on December 16, 714. However, Charles Martel, Pippin's son by his mistress, Alpaida (or Chalpaida), had gained favour among the Austrasians, primarily for his military prowess and ability to keep them well supplied with booty from his conquests. Despite the efforts of Plectrude to silence her rival's child by imprisoning him, he became the sole Mayor of the Palace and de facto ruler of Francia.<br />
 <br />
Married Plectrude around 670. Known children:<br />
    * Drogo (c. 695-708)<br />

From Wikipedia - Llywelyn the Last<br />
 <br />
Llywelyn ap Gruffudd or Gruffydd (c. 1228-December 11, 1282) was the second-to-last prince of an independent Wales before its conquest by Edward I of England. In Welsh, he is remembered as Llywelyn Ein Llyw Olaf (Llywelyn, Our Last Leader).<br />
 <br />
He was one of the four sons of Gruffydd, the illegitimate son of Llywelyn the Great. Opinions vary as to whether Llywelyn was the second or third son, but he was definitely not the eldest. Having fought off the opposition of his uncles and of his eldest brother, he laid claim to the principality of Gwynedd in 1258, and took the title Prince of Wales, which was then virtually a new concept. He was recognised as such by Henry III of England in the Treaty of Montgomery in 1267. However, Llywelyn's territorial ambitions gradually made him unpopular with some of the other Welsh leaders, particularly the princes of south Wales.<br />
 <br />
Although a capable military leader, Llywelyn lacked the political acumen of his grandfather, and made an unnecessary enemy of King Edward I of England by continuing to ally himself with the family of Simon de Montfort even after a precarious peace with the English had been concluded. Edward took exception to Llywelyn's marriage contract with Simon's daughter, Eleanor, seized the ship carrying her from France to Wales, and kept her prisoner at Windsor until Llywelyn made certain concessions. They were eventually married at Worcester in 1278.<br />
 <br />
Unusually for a Welsh prince, Llywelyn had no heirs (illegitimate sons being allowed by Welsh law to inherit), and depended on Eleanor to provide him with one. In 1282, she gave birth to a daughter, Gwenllian, but died in doing so, an event which seems to have had a serious emotional impact on Llywelyn. It was at this point that his younger brother, Dafydd, launched an attack on the English. Llywelyn felt obliged to support his brother, and a war began for which the Welsh were ill-prepared. Llywelyn's capable military leadership might still have prevailed, but he was ambushed and killed at Cilmeri, near Builth Wells, while attempting to rally support in south Wales. It was not until some time later that an English knight recognised the body as that of the prince. His head was then severed and delivered to London, where it was paraded through the streets.<br />
 <br />
With the loss of Llywelyn, Welsh morale and the will to resist diminished, and Dafydd, having declared himself Llywelyn's successor, was forced to flee into the mountains. He was betrayed, captured and executed by Edward I. His wife and sons ended their lives in captivity. Llywelyn's daughter, Gwenllian, was sent to the convent of Sempringham in Lincolnshire, where she died in her fifties.<br />

Arnoul was the 29th. Bishop of Metz, in 612. He was canonized by theChurch, Saint Arnoul. He became the Mayor of the Palace of Austrasia, andtutor of Dagobert. In the year 614, when Clotaire II had had Brunehautkilled, he remained the only descendant of the sons of Clovis alive. Buthe is only a toy in the hands of the Franc aristocracy both lay andecclesiastic. At the head of each of the three ancient kingdoms,Austrasia, Neustria and Burgundy, the Major Domus [Mayor of the Palace]gains progressively greater importance. On 18 October 614, Clotaire IIsigned the Edict of Paris which in 27 articles, essentially formed thebasic power structure for the Council of Bishops and the Assembly of theGreats [nobles].<br />
 <br />
In 623, Clotaire II was pushed by the Bishop of Metz and also Pepin [Le Vieux de Landen] , the Mayor of the Palace to give Austrasia its own King. Thus, Clotaire II's son Dagobert became King of Austrasia and under the tutelage of Arnoul.<br />
 <br />
From Wikipedia<br />
 <br />
Arnulf of Metz (August 13, 582 - August 16, 640) was a Frankish noble, who had great influence in the Merovingian kingdoms as bishop and was later made a saint.<br />
 <br />
Arnulf gave distinguished service at the Austrasian court under Theudebert II (595-612). In 613, however, with Pippin of Landen he led the aristocratic opposition to Queen Brunhilda of Austrasia that led to her downfall and the reunification of Frankish lands under Clotaire II. About the same year, he became Bishop of Metz.<br />
 <br />
From 623, again with Pippin, now Mayor of the Austrasian palace, Arnulf was adviser to Dagobert I, before retiring in 627 to become a hermit in the Vosges mountains with his friend Romaric.<br />
 <br />
Before he was consecrated, he had three children by his wife, Doda:<br />
    * Ansegisel<br />
    * Chlodulf<br />
    * Martin<br />
 <br />
Ansegisel married Pippin's daughter, Begga, and the son of this marriage, Pippin II, was Charlemagne's great-grandfather.<br />
 <br />
Arnulf was canonized and is known as the patron saint of brewing. His feast day is either July 18 or August 16. In iconography, he is portrayed with a rake in his hand. He is often confused in the legends with Arnold of Soissons, another patron saint of brewing. He is also known as Saint Arnold.<br />
 <br />
Uncertain Ancestry<br />
While Arnulf is recognised as one of the earliest documented ancestors of, say, Charlemagne and thereby most modern European Royal families, Arnulf's own parentage is both uncertain and undocumented:<br />
 <br />
    * Some have claimed that Arnulf's father was Arnoldus (b Abt. 535, Saxony, Germany - d. 600), and that his mother was Ada of Schwabia<br />
    * According to Frankish myth, Arnulf was the son of Bodigisel.<br />
    * Others have claimed that Arnulf's mother was Berthe, Princess of Paris (539-640)<br />
    * Still others hold that Arnulf descended from Mellobaude thus:<br />

The Buffalo News, 4 July 1990<br />

PILOT WHO LOVED TO FLY CRASHES AT NIAGARA SHOW<br />
SOUTH SALEM - An entrepreneur who a friend said had "flying in his blood" died Sunday afternoon when his plane crashed into the Niagara River in an air show witnessed by more than 20,000 people.<br />
Gifford "Giff" Foley, 43, of South Salem in Westchester County was flying a World War II A-T6 training plane when the accident occurred in U.S. waters about 800 yards from the Canadian border, according to Petty Officer James Nesselbush of the Coast Guard.<br />
Alone in the sky, Foley's plane "seemed to be going into a turn" but then apparently took a nose dive and plunged into the river, Nesselbush said.<br />
Divers found Foley's body in the cockpit under about 19 feet of water off Buffalo Harbor where the river flows into Lake Erie, he said.<br />
The Federal Aviation Administration is investigating the crash, said Kathleen Bergen, an agency spokeswoman.<br />
Foley was described by friends as an entrepreneur with a soaring spirit who attended all the best schools and loved to race old planes.<br />
"He was a very unique individual," said Ken Wilson of Katonah, who was Foley's roommate at Dartmouth College and the Harvard Business School. "Flying was in his blood."<br />
A former Marine who received numerous decorations for his service in Vietnam, Foley owned four businesses in the Northeast and often commuted to each in one of his private planes, Wilson said. Foley's businesses included a manufacturing company in Massachusetts and a consulting firm in Danbury, Conn., he said.<br />
Foley had been flying for about 15 years and lately had been in the air "two or three days a week," Wilson said. "He used to participate in a lot of air races."<br />
As a pilot, Foley was "very highly skilled and qualified for the low- level flight activity by the appropriate officials," said Garson Fields of Northampton, Mass., who owned several airplanes with Foley and had first known him while they attended Kent School in Connecticut.<br />
"It was his real love in life," Fields said.<br />
His widow, April Foley, said she did not join her husband in Buffalo for the air show because she had taken the couple's three children to visit their grandparents.<br />
At least 20,000 spectators had gathered along the river in Buffalo to watch the show, which was part of the fourth annual International Friendship Festival celebrating good relations between the United States and Canada, Nesselbush said. He said thousands more lined the Canadian shore.<br />
This year was the first time the festival sponsored an air show. At least 10 pilots were scheduled to perform, but the rest of the show was canceled after the crash.<br />

------------------------<br />
Giff Foley had a profound impact on Kent. A leader in all aspects of school life during his three years here, Giff excelled as a multi-sport athlete, earning seven letters in football, wrestling and crew. His senior year he served as a Prefect, captained the football team and was awarded Pater's Mug as the outstanding male athlete in the School. He attended Dartmouth College where he continued his success as a standout football player. After earning two letters and All-Ivy honorable mention honors, Giff took a leave from Dartmouth to join the U.S. Marine Corps where he served with honor in Vietnam and was awarded a Silver Star. Returning to Dartmouth, he rejoined the football team and anchored the defensive line on the undefeated championship team of 1970 that won the Lambert Trophy as the best team in the east. That year Dartmouth nominated Giff for the "Swede" Nelson Award, recognizing "outstanding achievement in academics, athletics, sportsmanship and citizenship" among the leading football players in New England.<br />
After graduation Giff earned an MBA degree at Harvard Business School. He married April, a classmate at Harvard, and together they raised three children Giff Jr. (Kent '98), Catherine and James. He was invited to join the Board of Trustees and served with distinction when the school embarked on the successful campus consolidation program. He was a true son of Kent who made the School a better place for his having been here. Giff left us far too soon and rests up on Skiff Mountain where his inscription reads:<br />
Soldier, scholar, horseman he. What made us dream that he could comb grey hair?<br />
