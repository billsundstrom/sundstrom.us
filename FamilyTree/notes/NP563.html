<h2>Notes</h2>
Brunhilda of the VISIGOTHS
<p>
<a name ="I010782"><b>[I010782]</b></a><br />
From Wikipedia<br>
<br>
Brunhilda (in German) or Brunehaut (in French) (534-613) was a Frankish queen who ruled the East Frankish kingdoms of Austrasia and Burgundy in the names of her sons and grandsons. Initially known as a liberal ruler of great political acumen she became notorious for her cruelty and avarice. In some histories she is known as Brunhilde, or Brunechildis.<br>
<br>
She was born about 550, the daughter of the Visigoth king Athanagild of Spain and Ingonde, his queen. She married king Sigebert I of Austrasia, the grandson of Clovis, and joined him at Metz. Upon her marriage in 567 she abjured Arianism and converted to orthodox Roman Catholicism.<br>
<br>
Sigebert's father Clotaire had reunited the four kingdoms of France but when he died Sigebert and his three brothers divided them again. Sigebert ruled Austrasia and later shared Paris with his two surviving brothers when Charibert died in 570.<br>
<br>
Brunehaut's sister Galswintha married Sigebert's brother Chilperic I of the West Frankish kingdom of Neustria and Soissons in 567. He is thought to have proposed because he envied the attention garnered to his brother by the marriage to Brunehaut and he had Galswintha murdered within the year at the behest of his mistress Fredegund, whom he then married. Brunehaut so detested Fredegund for the death of her sister and this hatred was so fiercely reciprocated that the two queens persuaded their husbands to wage war. Germanus, Bishop of Paris, negotiated a brief peace between them until Chilperic invaded the Sigebert's dominions. Sigebert defeated Chilperic, who fled to Tournai, and the people of Paris hailed him as a conqueror when he went there with Brunehaut and their children. Germanus wrote to Brunehaut, asking her to persuade her husband to restore the peace of France and to spare his brother. Chroniclers of Germanus' life say that she ignored this; certainly Sigebert set out to besiege Tournai. Fredegund responded to this threat to her husband by hiring two assassins, who killed Sigebert at Vitry with poisoned daggers. Brunehaut was captured and imprisoned at Rouen. She escaped "after a series of extraordinary adventures"1 by marrying Chilperic's son, Merovech.<br>
<br>
Brunehaut now tried to seize the regency of Austrasia in the name of her son Childebert II but she was resisted fiercely by her nobles and had to retire to briefly to Burgundy before obtaining her goal. She ruled Austrasia until Childebert came of age in the early 580s. Upon his death in September or October 595 she attempted to govern Austrasia and Burgundy in the name of her grandsons Théodebert II and Theodoric II, respectively. She was exiled from Austrasia, and then persuaded Theodoric to attack his brother, whom he defeated at Toul and Tolbiac. Theodoric then had Théodebert and his family killed but himself died soon after. It was during these later regencies that Desiderius, Bishop of Vienne (later Saint Didier) publicly accused her of incest and cruelty. Desiderius finally enraged her with a pointed sermon on chastity preached in 612 before her and Theodoric, with whom she hired three assassins to murder him at the village now called Saint-Didier-sur-Chalaronne.<br>
<br>
In 576 Sigebert's brother Guntram, King of Burgundy, founded a bishopric that was suffragan of Vienne at Maurienne, which belonged to the Diocese of Turin. The Bishop of Turin protested this to Brunehaut for more than twenty years but even when Pope Gregory the Great supported his complaint in 599 Brunehaut dismissed it. In general, however, she protected the church and treated Gregory with great respect. He wrote a series of positive letters to her; in 597 he wrote to her about interdicting pagan rites such as tree worship. Gregory of Tours was another favoured cleric; he was a trusted courtier to her and her son from 587 until his death. She also took a keen personal interest in the bishoprics and monasteries within her dominion. This brought her into conflict with Columbanus, abbot of Luxeuil, whom she eventually exiled.<br>
<br>
When Theodoric died in 613 Brunehaut, now in her middle sixties, proclaimed one of her great-grandsons as king, but the nobles of Austrasia and Burgundy objected, rising in revolt against her, and called on Clotaire II, son of Fredegund, and king of most of France to help them. Brunehaut fled East, hoping to enlist the aid of the German tribes along the Rhine, but she was betrayed by the last of her followers, and delivered into the hands of her nephew and mortal enemy, Clotaire. Before a gathering of the nobility at Renève, Burgundy, he had her accused of causing many deaths, including those of ten kings and Desiderius, as well as several other churchmen. Brunehaut was condemned to death, and Clotaire brought the full force of his hatred and that of his deceased mother against their old foe: Brunehaut was put to slow torture, being stretched on the rack for three long days, before finally being chained between four horses and torn limb from limb, or, as some later stories would have it, tied to the tail of a wild mare and dragged to her death. According to the Liber Historiae Francorum:<br>
<br>
    "Then the army of the Franks and Burgundians joined into one, all shouted together that death would be most fitting for the very wicked Brunhilda. Then King Clotaire ordered that she be lifted on to a camel and led through the entire army. Then she was tied to the feet of wild horses and torn apart limb from limb. Finally she died. Her final grave was the fire. Her bones were burnt."<br>
<br>
One legend has her being dragged by a wild mare down the Roman road La Chaussée Brunehaut at Abbeville.<br>
<br>
Brunehaut was buried in the Abbaye de St. Martin at Autun that she founded in 602 on the spot where the bishop of Tours had cut down a beech-tree that served as an object of pagan worship. The abbey, which was destroyed in 1793 and Brunehaut's sarcophagus is now in the Musee Lapidaire in Avignon.<br>
<br>
Brunehaut commissioned the building of several churches and the abbey of St. Vincent at Laon (founded in 580). She is also credited with founding the castle of Bruniquel and having a Roman road resurfaced near Alligny-en-Morvan (where the name of a nearby hill Terreau Bruneau is believed to be derived from hers). The part of Mauves-sur-Loire known as la Fontaine Bruneau is named after Brunehaut who may have cooled herself with the fountain's water when she suffered heat exhaustion.<br>
<br>
Her life seems to have been incorporated into the legend of the Valkirie Brynhild, and to have thus formed the basis for aspects of Wagner's Brunhilde.<br>

Sigmund VOLSUNGSSON
<p>
<a name ="I008195"><b>[I008195]</b></a><br />
From Wikipedia<br>
<br>
In Norse mythology, Sigmund was a hero whose story is told in Volsunga saga. He and his sister, Signy, are the children of Volsung. Sigmund is best known as the father of Sigurd the dragon-slayer, though Sigurd's tale has almost no connections to the Volsung tales.<br>
<br>
In the Volsunga Saga, Signy marries Siggeir, the king of Gautland (i.e. modern Götaland and Beowulf's Geatland. However, in some English translations he is described as the king of the Goths). Volsung and Sigmund were attending the wedding feast (which lasted for some time before and after the marriage), when Odin, in the guise of a beggar, plunged a sword into the living tree around which Volsung's halls was built. The disguised Odin announced that the man who could remove the sword would have it as a gift. Only Sigmund was able to free the sword.<br>
<br>
Siggeir is smitten with envy and desire for the sword. Siggeir invited Sigmund, his father Völsung and Sigmund's nine brothers to a visit in Gautland to see the newlyweds three months later. When the Völsung clan had arrived they were attacked by the Gauts (Geats) and king Völsung was killed and his sons captured. Signy beseached her husband to spare her brothers and to put them in stocks instead of killing them. As Siggeir thought that the brothers deserved to be tortured before they were killed, he agreed.<br>
<br>
He then let his shape-shifting mother turn into a wolf and each night devour one of the brothers, until only Sigmund remained. Signy had a servant smear honey on the face of Sigmund and when the she-wolf arrived she started licking the honey off Sigmund's face. She licked and stuck her tongue into Sigmund's mouth whereupon Sigmund bit her tongue off, killing her. Sigmund then hid in the forests of Gautland and Signy brought him everything he needed.<br>
<br>
Sigmund escaped his bonds and lived underground in the wilderness on Siggeir's lands. While he was in hiding, Signy came to him in the guise of a Völva (sorceress) and conceived a child by him Sinfjötli (the Fitela of Beowulf). Bent on revenge for their father's death, Signy sent her sons to Sigmund in the wilderness, one by one, to be tested. As each failed, Signy urged Sigmund to kill them. Finally, Sinfjötli (born of the incest between Signy and Sigmund) passed the test.<br>
<br>
Sigmund and his son/nephew, Sinfjötli, grew wealthy as outlaws. In their wanderings, they came upon men sleeping in cursed wolf skins. Upon killing the men and wearing the wolf skins, Sigmund and Sinfjötli were cursed to a type of lycanthropy. Eventually, Sinfjötli and Sigmund avenged the death of Volsung.<br>
<br>
After the death of Signy, Sigmund and Sinfjötli went harrying together. Sigmund married a woman named Borghild and had two sons, one of them named Helgi. Helgi and Sinfjötli ruled a kingdom jointly. Helgi married a woman named Sigrun after killing her father. Sinfjötli later killed Sigrun's brother in battle and Sigrun avenged her brother by poisoning Sinfjötli.<br>
<br>
Later, Sigmund married a woman named Hjördı́s. After a short time of peace, Sigmund's lands were attacked by King Lyngi. While in battle, Sigmund matched up against an old man (Odin in disguise). Odin shattered Sigmund's sword, and Sigmund fell at the hands of others. Dying, Sigmund told Hjördı́s that she was pregnant and that her son would one day make a great weapon out of the fragments of his sword. That son was Sigurd.<br>
<br>
Sigmund's story may be based on older material than that found in the Sigurd story and it is more directly involved in matters of family descent and the conquest of lands. If there is a historical person behind the Sigmund stories, it is probably a chieftain from the time of the first great Germanic migration in the second and third centuries CE.<br>
