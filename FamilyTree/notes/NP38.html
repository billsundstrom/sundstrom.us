Hugh BIGOD
<p>
<a name ="I004925"><b>[I004925]</b></a><br />
From Wikipedia<br>
<br>
Hugh Bigod (1186-1225) of Thetford, was the eldest son of Roger, Earl of Norfolk, and for a short time the 3rd Earl of Norfolk, Earl Marshall of England, and one of the 25 surites of Magna Carta of King John. He succeeded to his father's estates circa 1220, during the 5th year of the reign of King Henry III. (Richard Thomson: An Historical Essay on Magna Charta, London, 1829; Page 311.)<br>
<br>
Hugh Bigod, the 3rd Earl of Norfolk, was one of the eight Barons who resisted the King's autocratic maladministration of the economy in what later became known as the barons war which was led by Simon de Montfort, Earl of Leicester, and brother-in-law to Henry III. The revolt now represents the most important demand for parliamentary democracy in England, called for by peers of the realm, after the events that led King John to sign Magna Charta.<br>
<br>
Simon de Montfort was one of the 12 signitories of the 'April Confederacy', which represented the inception of the revolutionary movement, and one of the 24 authors of the 'Provisions of Oxford'. He was one of the 15 members of the privy council, along with Hugh Bigod and the earls of Gloucester and Hereford, Roger Mortimer, John fitz Geoffrey, Peter de Montfort, (not related to Simon), and the Bishop of Worcester. These barons thought fit to stand against the King and signed an oath to form a commune 'in which they swore to look after each others interests'. Richard de Clare, Earl of Gloucester, and Roger, then the Earl of Norfolk (Hugh Bigod's father), and Peter of Savoy signed the oath.<br>
<br>
The conservative faction, led by Richard, Earl of Gloucester, supported the Provisions of Oxford and the Ordinance of the Sheriffs, but opposed the Provisions of Westminster. They wanted control over the king and his officials, but rejected a similar control over themselves and their agents. While many of the barons joined this alliance, Hugh Bigod, the justiciar, and Humphrey de Bohun, 2nd Earl of Hereford, remained neutral.<br>
<br>
King Henry III's foreign advisors were compelled to leave the country, for fear of their lives, following the disruption that followed these events, but were met at the castle of the Bishop of Winchester, Aymer of Valance, one of the foreign advisors employed by Henry, and were besieged by the Barons. The Barons confederaton, lead by Hugh Bigod, banished the French from the country, confiscating their castles issuing a stern warning not to return.<br>
<br>
De Montfort had the support of the Earl of Gloucester, the 'Cinque Ports', and the citizens of London, besides most of the lesser nobility, and controlled the south of the country. In May 1264, Leicester discovered the king was camped at Lewes, and on 14th, attacked and won the Battle of Lewes, capturing Henry, his brother the Prince Edward, Richard of Cornwall and Henry of Almain.<br>
<br>
Simon De Montfort later was killed at the Battle of Evesham, but the revolt continued until July of 1267 with small pockets of resistance remaining in different parts of the country.<br>

Hugh BIGOD
<p>
<a name ="I004929"><b>[I004929]</b></a><br />
From Wikipedia<br>
<br>
Hugh Bigod, 1st Earl of Norfolk (1095 - 1177) was born in Belvoir Castle, Leicestershire, England.<br>
<br>
He was the second son of Roger Bigod (d. 1107), Sheriff of Norfolk, who founded the Bigod name in England. Hugh Bigod became a controversial figure in history, known for his frequent switching of loyalties and hasty reactions towards measures of authority. Hence the words bigot and bigotry.<br>
<br>
Early years<br>
Hugh inherited large estates in East Anglia on the death of his brother William, who perished without issue in the sinking of the White Ship on November 26, 1119. He succeeded his aunt Albreda - and by extension, her eldest brother Berengar - as heir both to Berengar's tenancy-in-chief in Lincolnshire and the Norman lands of Robert de Tosny of Belvoirwas. He became Constable of Norwich Castle and Governor of the City of Norwich in 1122. He enjoyed the favour of Henry I.<br>
<br>
During King Stephen's reign<br>
At first a supporter of Stephen of Blois during this king's struggle with the empress Matilda. His initiation in history was on the death of Henry I in 1135, when Maud expected to succeed to the throne of England, but her cousin, Stephen of Blois usurped the throne, breaking an oath he had previously made to defend her rights. It was Bigod who claimed that Henry I (Maud's father, and Stephen's uncle) intended for Stephen to become king at the expense of the empress. Civil War followed, but neither side seem to gain the upper hand. It was not until 1139 that Maud could command the military strength necessary to challenge Stephen within his own realm. Maud's greatest triumph came in April 1141, when her forces defeated and captured King Stephen, he was made a prisoner and effectively deposed. Her advantage lasted only a few months. In 1147, Maud was finally forced to return to France, following the death of Robert of Gloucester, her strongest supporter. Hugh is said to have supported Stephen during the conflict. On the death of king Henry he is said to have hastened to London and sworn an oath to the Archbishop that the dying king Henry had left the throne to Stephen of Blois over some quarrel with his daughter. For his actions he was rewarded with the Earldom of Norfolk before 1141.<br>
<br>
King Stephen's new energy kept his followers together at first, but before long, in the next year Stephen was stricken with sickness. A lethargy fastened on him and the report of his death was quickly spread abroad. A rising of the turbulent barons necessarily followed, and Bigod was the first to take up arms. He seized and held Norwich; but Stephen, quickly recovering laid siege to the city and Hugh was compelled to surrender. Acting with unusual clemency, Stephen spared the rebel, who for a short time remained faithful. The open opposition of the Empress Matilda along with King Stephens's weak hand, gave in to a period of unrest later known as the "General Anarchy". Stephen's time was fully occupied in subduing the so-called adherents of the empress, who were really fighting for their own land.<br>
<br>
In 1140 the Earl is said to have declared for the empress holding a siege in his castle of Bungay; yet in the next year he is in the ranks of Stephen's army fighting the disastrous Battle of Lincoln, after which the Earl deserted him and assumed a position of armed neutrality during the period of 'General Anarchy'.<br>
<br>
Later, the disagreement between King Stephen and Archbishop Theobald in 1148, created yet another scenario for Hugh Bigod to come forward; this time, he sided with the archbishop, and received him in his Castle of Framlingham, but joined with others in effecting a reconciliation.<br>
<br>
Rise of King Henry II<br>
Five years later, in 1153, when Henry, Duke of Anjou, soon to be King Henry II (r.1154 - 1189), landed in England to assert his claim to the throne, Bigod vested his interests with the rising power, and held out in Ipswich against Stephen's forces, while Henry II, on the other side, laid siege to Stamford. Both places fell. In the critical state of his fortunes Stephen was in no position to punish the rebel. Negotiations were also going on between the two parties, and Hugh again eluded retaliation.<br>
<br>
On Henry II's accession in December 1154, Bigod at once received confirmation of the possession of his earldom and stewardship by charter issued apparently in January of the next year. The first years of the new reign were spent in restoring order to the shattered kingdom, and in breaking the power of the independent barons, which had grown out of control during King Stephen's reign.<br>
<br>
It was not before long that Bigod became agitated under the rule of law initiated by Henry. He grew restless with measures such as the scutage, a fee paid by vassals in lieu of military service, which became the central feature of Henry II's military system of operation by 1159. The Earl showed signs of resistance, but was at once put down. In 1157 Henry II marched into the eastern counties and received the earl's submission.<br>
<br>
After this incident Hugh Bigod makes no significant appearances in the chronicles for some time; he is named among those who had been excommunicated by Becket, in consequence of his retention of lands belonging to the monastery of Pentney in Norfolk.<br>
<br>
The Revolt of 1173<br>
In 1173 the young crowned prince Henry (also known as Henry the Young King), raised a revolt against his father, Henry II. This gave Hugh Bigod, yet another chance for rebellion, along with the league of the English barons with the kings of France and Scotland in his favor. He at once became a leader in the cause, perhaps eager to revive the feudal power, which Henry II had curtailed. In addition to the fact that the inevitable conflict, as far as England was concerned, centered round his possesions. The custody of Norwich Castle was promised by the young prince as his reward.<br>
<br>
The king's energy and good fortune were equal to the occasion. While he held in check his rebel vassals in France, the loyal barons in England defeated his enemies there. Robert de Beaumont, Earl of Leices (d.1190) landed at Walton, in Suffolk, on September 29, 1173 and marched to Framlingham, joining forces with Hugh. Together they besieged and took the castle of Hagenet in Suffolk on October 13, held by Randal de Broc for the crown. But the Earl of Leices was defeated and taken prisioner setting out from Framlingham at Fornham, St. Genevieve, near Bury by the justiciar, Richard de Lucy and other barons. These, then turned their arms against Earl Hugh, not strong enough to fight, he opened negotiations with his assailants. It is said he bought them off, and at the same time secured a safe passage home for the Flemings in his service.<br>
<br>
Final days<br>
Though defeated and compelled to surrender his castles, Bigod kept his lands and his earldom, and lived at peace with Henry II until his death reportedly in 1177, in Palestine.<br>
<br>
It should be noted, however, that on March 1st 1177, his son Roger Bigod appealed to the king on a dispute with his stepmother. Hugh being dead at this time, the date of his death is fixed 'ante caput jejunii,' (i.e. before March 9th). If, then, he died in Palestine, his death must have taken place in the preceding year, 1176, to allow time for the arrival of the news in England. Henry II took advantage of Roger's appeal to seize upon the late Earl's treasure. He possesed vast estates, which he inherited, and was also the recipient of the third penny levied in the county of Norfolk.<br>
<br>
He married twice.<br>
<br>
* In 1149 he married Juliane de Vere (1129-c.1199) born in Hedingham, Essex, England. She was Countess of Norfolk, the daughter of Aubrey de Vere, 2nd Earl of Oxford and Adeliza de Clare, a nun who was the daughter of Gilbert Fitz Richard de Clare, 2nd Earl of Clare. Their son:<br>
          o Roger Bigod (b.1150-1220), who would later become his succesor as 2nd Earl of Norfolk.<br>
<br>
* His second wife was Gundreda Warwick (c.1135-1200), daughter of Roger, Earl of Warwick. They had two children:<br>
          o Hugh Bigod (b.1156)<br>
          o William Hugh (b.1168)<br>
</p>
Roger BIGOD
<p>
<a name ="I004927"><b>[I004927]</b></a><br />
Roger Bigod (d. 1221), was the son of Hugh Bigod, 1st Earl of Norfolk and succeeded to the earldom of Norfolk, was confirmed in his earldom and other honours by Richard I, after he had fallen under the displeasure of Henry II. King Richard also sent him to France as an ambassador in 1189.<br>
<br>
He took part in the negotiations for the release of Richard from prison, and after the king's return to England became justiciar. The earl was one of the leaders of the baronial party which obtained John's assent to Magna Carta, and his name appears among the signatories to this document.<br>
<br>
Roger was married to Ida, a former mistress of King Henry II.<br>
</p>
Roger BIGOD
<p>
<a name ="I004931"><b>[I004931]</b></a><br />
From Wikipedia<br>
<br>
Roger Bigod (d. 1107) was a Norman knight who came to England in the Norman Conquest. He held great power in East Anglia, and four of his descendants were Earl of Norfolk.<br>
<br>
Roger came from a fairly obscure family of poor knights in Normandy. Robert le Bigot, who was probably Roger's father, acquired an important position in the household of William, duke of Normandy (later William I of England), due, the story goes, to his disclosure to the duke of a plot by the duke's cousin William of Mortain.<br>
<br>
Robert or Roger, or perhaps even both, fought at the Battle of Hastings, and afterwards they were rewarded with a substantial estate in East Anglia. The Domesday Book lists Roger as holding 6 lordships in Essex, 117 in Suffolk and 187 in Norfolk.<br>
<br>
Bigod's base was in Thetford, Norfolk where he founded a priory later donated to the great monastery at Cluny. In 1101 he further consolidated his power when Henry I granted him licence to build a castle at Framlingham, which became the family seat of power until their downfall in 1307. Two of the places associated with Roger Bigod are Framlingham and Bungay in Suffolk. Framlingham Castle and Bungay Castle were built and improved by successive generations.<br>
<br>
In 1069 he, along with Robert Malet and Ralph de Gael (the then Earl of Norfolk), defeated Sweyn I of Denmark near Ipswich. After Ralph de Gael's fall in 1074, Roger was appointed Sheriff of Norfolk and Suffolk, and acquired many of the dispossessed earl's estates. For this reason he is sometimes counted as Earl of Norfolk, but he probably was never actually created earl. He acquired further estates through his influence in local law courts.<br>
<br>
In the Rebellion of 1088 he joined other Anglo-Norman barons against William II, who, it was hoped, was to be deposed in favour of Robert Curthose, Duke of Normandy. He seems to have lost his lands after the rebellion had failed, but got them back again.<br>
<br>
In 1101 there was another attempt to bring in Robert of Normandy by unseating Henry I, but this time Roger Bigod stayed loyal to Henry.<br>
<br>
He died on September 9, 1107 and is buried in Norwich. Upon his death there was a dispute between the Bishop of Norwich, Herbet Losinga and the monks at Thetford, the priory founded by Bigod. The monks claimed that Roger's body, along with those of his family and successors, was due to them as part of the foundation charter of the priory (as was common practice at the time). The issue was apparently resolved when the Bishop of Norwich stole the body in the middle of the night and dragged it back to Norwich.<br>
<br>
For some time he was thought to have two wives, Adelaide/Adeliza and Alice de Tosny. It is now believed these were the same woman, Adeliza(Alice) de Tosny(Toeni,Toeny). She was the sister and coheiress of William de Tosny, Lord of Belvoir.<br>
<br>
He was succeeded by his eldest son, William Bigod, and, after he drowned in the sinking of the White Ship, by his second son, Hugh Bigod, who later became Earl of Norfolk. He also had 3 daughters: Gunnor, who married Robert, Lord of Rayleigh; Cecily, who married William d'Albini "Brito"; and Maud, who married William d'Albini "Pincerna", earl of Arundel.<br>

Franklin Swift BILLINGS
<p>
<a name ="I083846"><b>[I083846]</b></a><br />
Vermont Governor. A member of one of Vermont's most wealthy and prominent families, he graduated from Harvard University in 1885, worked on a Kansas sheep ranch and then engaged in the import-export business in New York City. In 1903 he moved to Vermont and was a director of the Woodstock Railway Company, Woodstock Hotel Company, Woodstock Aqueduct Company, Woodstock Electric Company, and other corporations. Billings was also President of the Woodstock Ice Supply Company, and Treasurer of the Empire Building Company and the Vermont Investment Company. From 1904 to 1906 he was Chief of Staff of the Vermont National Guard with rank of Colonel. The longtime Chairman of the Woodstock Village Meeting and an active Republican, he also served in the Vermont House from 1910 to 1913. Billings returned to the Vermont House from 1921 to 1923 and served as Speaker. From 1923 to 1925 he was Lieutenant Governor. In 1926 he won election as Governor and served from 1925 to 1927.

Franklin Swift BILLINGS
<p>
<a name ="I083845"><b>[I083845]</b></a><br />
Legislator and Jurist. The son of Governor Franklin Billings, he graduated from Harvard University in 1943. He failed his military induction physical, so he joined the American Field Service as an ambulance driver. He served with the British Eighth Army and 6th Armoured Division, was wounded at the Battle of Monte Casinno, and earned the Purple Heart and British Empire Medal. He graduated from the University of Virginia Law School. A Republican, he served in several appointed offices, including Assistant Secretary and Secretary of the Vermont Senate, Executive Clerk to Governor Joseph Johnson, Secretary of Civil and Military Affairs (chief assistant) to Governor Robert Stafford, and Judge of the Hartford Municipal Court. He served in the Vermont House from 1961 to 1965, and was Speaker in his final term. During his Speakership the Vermont House conformed to federal proportional representation requirements, moving from "one town, one vote" and over 240 members to 150 elected by district. He then became a Superior Court Judge. He was a Justice of the Vermont Supreme Court from 1975 to 1983, and Chief Justice from 1983 to 1984. In 1984 he was appointed US District Judge, and served until assuming senior status in 1994.<br>
---------------------------------------------------------------<br>
WOODSTOCK - Back in 1925, Franklin S. Billings Jr., then age 3, scampered on his family's porch beside his father, who was governor of Vermont, and friend Calvin Coolidge, who was president of the United States. <br>
It didn't matter that the Secret Service shooed him away. Billings already had inherited a passion for public life he would share - as a state speaker of the House, Supreme Court chief justice and U.S. District Court judge - until his death Sunday at the home where he was born 91 years ago. <br>
"He exemplified the best qualities of Vermont and what a Vermont statesman should be," said U.S. Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., who first met Billings as a fledgling lawyer recruited to help the Legislature navigate the New Frontier of the 1960s. <br>
Entering the world June 5, 1922, Billings was believed to be the great-great-grandson of the first white colonist born in Vermont (in 1754). He went to Woodstock public schools until 1935, when his father died of a heart attack and his mother moved the family to her native Milton, Mass. <br>
Billings graduated from Harvard University in 1943, only to flunk his physical exam for World War II military service. Undeterred, he volunteered as an Army ambulance driver in Italy, where he crawled out of a flaming vehicle after it struck a landmine in 1944, only to be rescued by a British transport that tipped over, mixing up his identification with the papers of an injured German lieutenant. <br>
( Billings would finally receive a Purple Heart for his efforts in 2010.) <br>
Earning a law degree from the University of Virginia School in 1947, Billings returned to his Vermont roots, where elementary classmates welcomed him to join their high school reunions. <br>
Locally, Billings served as a village trustee, Select Board member, school director, planning commissioner, library trustee and town moderator and, regionally, as a Hartford municipal court judge from 1955-62. <br>
At the state level, he was assistant Senate secretary from 1949-54, Gov. Joseph Johnson's executive clerk from 1955-56, Senate secretary from 1957-59 and Gov. Robert Stafford's secretary of civil and military affairs from 1959-60. <br>
Elected Woodstock's state House representative in 1960, the Republican joined 10 other freshmen in an informal caucus tagged the "Young Turks." When one of them - a fellow lawyer named Philip Hoff - was inaugurated as the state's first popularly elected Democratic governor in 1963, Billings was voted speaker of the House. <br>
The first Vermonter to win two consecutive terms, Billings presided over the Legislature that reapportioned itself from a 246-seat House where each of Vermont's cities and towns had its own representative to the current 150-member chamber. <br>
Billings would support Hoff over Republican challenger Richard Snelling in 1966, then win the Democrat's appointment as a Superior Court judge later that year and earn succeeding Gov. Thomas P. Salmon's nomination as a Supreme Court justice in 1975. <br>
But Billings ascended to his top posts thanks to the GOP. Snelling, after trying to torpedo his Superior Court selection, named him Supreme Court chief justice in 1982 - the first in state history to be decided by the chief executive rather than by seniority. <br>
President Ronald Reagan promoted Billings to the U.S. District Court in 1984 - but only after postponing the process for months after partisans questioned whether Billings was an "activist" judge. <br>
As state Supreme Court chief justice, Billings pushed for female judges (three decades ago, Vermont had yet to appoint one) and cameras in courtrooms (the state was the only one in New England to bar them). <br>
"Society has changed, and I'm not sure this court has," he said at the time. "The law has to develop with it." <br>
A full-time U.S. judge until his 72nd birthday in 1994, Billings became an outspoken opponent of federal mandatory minimum sentencing laws. <br>
"This type of statute denies the judges of this court and of all courts the right to bring their conscience, experience, discretion and sense of what is just into the sentencing procedure," he said in 1990. "It, in effect, makes the judge a computer, automatically imposing sentences without regard to what is right." <br>
The same year, Billings presided over the first case tried in a federal court that allowed DNA testing as evidence. <br>
Billings married Pauline Richardson Gillingham - granddaughter of the founder of Woodstock's famed F.H. Gillingham & Sons general store - in 1951. The couple went on to raise four children: sons Frank and Jireh, who now own and operate the downtown institution, and daughters Elizabeth and Ann. <br>
Billings was a member of the Grange, Masons and Shrine and on the board of Vermont Law School in South Royalton. He was also an original trustee of the Calvin Coolidge Memorial Foundation, having attended the president's 1933 burial service at age 11. <br>
Leahy, who as a U.S. senator would support Billings ' nomination to the federal court, said he always admired the late judge. <br>
"He was wise and decent and generous," Leahy said. "Though we were of different parties, he was always helpful in the best interests of Vermont, and never partisan." <br>
Leahy had graduated from law school in 1964 when Billings hired him to help draft the bill that would reapportion the Legislature. <br>
"He used to invite me into his office and give me the history of what was going on," Leahy recalled. "Even though I grew up in Montpelier almost across the street from the State House, I always learned something. I considered him one of the pivotal people in my own career." <br>
U.S. Rep. Peter Welch, D-Vt., who first met Billings upon moving to the state as a young lawyer in 1974, visited the retired judge at home earlier this winter. <br>
"He was in failing health, but he was still reading the newspaper and interested in what I was doing," the congressman said Monday. "That zest for life - you could still see it. That outward perspective is something he has always had and I suspect helped sustain him. He was an inspiration for me, but I know that's true for many, many of us." <br>
Billings is survived by his wife of 62 years, four children and eight grandchildren. <br>
"His great part in leadership was his ability to compromise and come out with the right answers for the greatest number of people," his widow told The Associated Press. "One knew where he stood at all times. His word was his bond." <br>
The family will hold a private service "pursuant to Franklin's wishes." Memorial contributions can be made to the Thompson Senior Center in Woodstock.<br>
