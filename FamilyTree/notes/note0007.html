This is my great granddfather. I just received info from hisgrandaughter, my mother's cousin, that Eugene was not a Johnson but was"adopted" either legally or not, after Civil War. Perhaps father died init. His "Father" was Francis Asbury Johnson b. in Bledsoe County, TN. sonof Aquilla Johnson and Mary Scarborough. Francis' wife was Drucilla orPriscilla Elizabeth Payne (Bath Co., VA.). I wonder if Eugene was aBascom and kept that as a middle name after being taken in by Francis A.Johnson. Eugene was born 3/1/1858 in Knoxville TN. His wife was CynthiaRosella Hawkins. This is a shot in the dark. Thanks.<br />

His dream may have been on the pitcher's mound as a professional baseballplayer, but Robert H. Hertzberger opted instead for a career in publicservice, a decision that offered him something with "a little morepromise."<br />
Hertzberger, 70, who served 20 years on the Evansville Police Department, died Tuesday, June 20, 2000, at Highland Pointe Healthcare.<br />
He had been at the health care facility for about four weeks, said his wife, Barbara Hertzberger, who is also a retired police officer.<br />
Her husband played professional baseball with the Milwaukee Braves organization after graduation from Reitz High School, where he played on the state championship football team and lettered in basketball and track.<br />
But when Hertzberger gave up on professional baseball, the former All-American athlete came home.<br />
Baseball's loss was Evansville's gain, and at the suggestion of his father, he went on to join the Evansville Police Department, from where he retired in 1974.<br />
He had a lengthy career in law enforcement and public service.<br />
"He was extremely well organized, very personable," said attorney Jeffrey Lantz.<br />
"He didn't know anybody who wasn't a friend."<br />
Hertzberger worked as Lantz's chief investigator and office manager while Lantz was Vanderburgh County prosecutor .<br />
Hertzberger was appointed by the local Republican Party to fill a vacant city clerk's position in 1979, but lost his bid for the job in the general election.<br />
He also lost a bid for county treasurer in 1976, and served as administrator of the Voters Administration Office.<br />
He also served as manager of Burdette Park.<br />
He served in various leadership positions at the local and international levels of Civitan International, receiving both the Mr. Civitan Award and the International Honor Key, the group's highest honor.<br />
As a life member of the Hadi Shrine Temple, he served as recorder for 14 years and was made recorder emeritus in 1989. He was also a member of the Lessing Masonic Lodge and Evansville Scottish Rite.<br />
"He was one of those types of guys, that if something had to be done he wanted to do it," said Mike Trible, a past potentate of the Temple for whom Hertzberger worked as an aide.<br />
"He was always comfortable. You enjoyed being around him. There was no pretension or animosity. He was just a friend."<br />
Among his many community activities, Hertzberger coached Junior League Football and served as director of the Police Athletic League camp for developmentally disabled children.<br />
Also surviving are a daughter, Phyllis Ann Morris of California; two sons, Charles E. and Robert L., both of Evansville; and a grandson, Chad Addison Hertzberger.<br />
Services will be at 10 a.m. Friday at Alexander Funeral Home North Chapel, the Rev. James T. Heady officiating, with burial in Onton Cemetery in Onton, Ky.<br />
Friends may call from 2 to 8 p.m. Thursday, with a Masonic service at 7 p.m. and an FOP memorial service following, at the funeral home.<br />

In the early spring of 1630, Dr. William Gager, along with his son John,began preparations to leave his ancestral home and medical practice to goto New England with the Massachusetts Bay Company. The voyage was to beunder the leadership of his friend and neighbor, John Winthrop. They wereto sail on the flagship ARABELLA, captained by one Peter Milborne andmanned by fifty-two crewmen. The names of the other ships in the Winthropfleet were: The JEWEL, The TALBOT, the CHARLES, the MAYFLOWER, theWILLIAM AND FRANCIS, the HOPEWELL, the WHALE, the SUCCESS, the TRAIL, andthe AMBROSE. The ships were ready in the harbor and loaded with hogsheadsof beer, water, "syder," vinegar, dried meat (16 hogsheads, and beeftongues. Some of the ships carried furniture, farm implements, andlivestock. These were the ships that were to carry seven -hundred or soimmigrants to the new world, to a new area, and to the religious freedomthat these Puritans had not experienced in their homeland. Also, therewas the promise of one hundred acres of free land to every man thatsigned on with the Massachusetts Bay Company.<br />
 <br />
    Their departure was scheduled for Easter Monday, March 29, 1630, on the morning tide...[something about repair work, perhaps causing a delay]. On Tuesday, April 6th, Matthew Cradock, the late Governor of the Massachusetts Bay Company, arrived from London to take his official leave of the party. When this formality was over, he was duly saluted as he went over the side. Then the ships, led by the ARABELLA, weighed anchor and leisurely sailed down the Solent (a strait of the English Channel), and came to anchorage before the castle at Yarmouth, on the west end of the Isle of Wight. It was here that the Reverend John Cotton, Vicar of Boston in Lincolnshire, came down and gave his blessing and approval of the undertaking. He preached to them from the book of II Samuel, verse 7:10. Shortly after this farewell sermon, the flotilla was finally underway.<br />
 <br />
    Winthrop writes in his journal that the weather was calm for the first few days and the passengers seemed to delight in what was a first of foremost of those on board. But the sea was soon to change, and with this many took to their bunks. So sick were many that they nearly died, and some did. Dr. Gager was obviously a busy man during this ordeal, but he too suffered from the malady for which the only cure is land.<br />
 <br />
    Land was sighted on Friday June 11, 1630, after eighty-four days of turbulent seas. They dropped anchor the following day near Salem. The passengers were all dressed in their finest for the occasion. The ARABELLA fired two shots to alert those on shore of their arrival. The reverend George Phillips gave thanks unto the Lord for their safe journey. Many of the passengers were sick from scurvy, caused by their unwholesome diet at sea. Dr. Gager was among those so afflicted. But along with the warm winds of summer, many were to have their full strength restored.<br />
 <br />
    Two years prior to this voyage, the Massachusetts Bay Company had sent John Endecott and a small company to prepare a place for the main arrival. Mr. Endecott said that several of his people were ill, and tired of eating mussels, berried, and indian corn. He also made it clear that many were anxious to return to England when the fleet departed.<br />
 <br />
    After careful observation, Winthrop and his company decide not to settle at Salem. They went down the coast a few miles to a place that the Court of Assistants soon named Boston, after the place of the same name in Lincolnshire, England. The leaders of the colony soon erected a church, and on August 27, 1630, Dr. Gager and others signed the first Church covenant of Boston.<br />
 <br />
    Dr. Gager and his son settled in Charlestown;, a section of the newly found Boston. While there, he was "Keeper of the Powder".<br />
 <br />
    Dr. William Gager never fully recovered from the ill -effects of the voyage from England, and died of a fever on September 20, 1630.<br />
 <br />
    William Gager's wife was Hannah Mayhew. She died in England, as did six of his other children. The deaths of these children are recorded in the Parish Records in Groton, England. Perhaps this great loss that he suffered was another reason for his departure from England. I can only assume that he thought things would be better in the New World.<br />
 <br />
    According to records, William Gager's son, John Gager, seems to be the only other survivor of the Gager family that made the 1630 voyage. The following is from Dr. Snow's History of Boston printed in 1828: In the midst of these afflictions, Dr. Gager died. He was their principal, if not their only, physician and surgeon. He is represented as a man of skill in his profession, and we have seen that the soundness of his faith and the purity of his life had promoted him to the office of a deacon in the infant church. He was considered a public servant; and the same court which provided for the salaries of the ministers ordered that a household be built for him against the coming spring, and that he should be furnished with a cow and be paid twenty pounds for his first year, and afterwards have thirty pounds per annum at the common charge. Dr. Gager is buried at Town Hill, Charlestown, Massachusetts.<br />

From Wikipedia<br />
 <br />
Amadeus III of Savoy (1095-1148) was Count of Savoy and Maurienne from 1103 until his death.<br />
 <br />
He was the son of Humbert II of Savoy and Gisela of Burgundy, daughter of William I of Burgundy, and succeeded as count on the death of his father. Amadeus had a tendency to exaggerate his titles, and also claimed to be duke of Lombardy, duke of Burgundy, duke of Chablais, and vicar of the Holy Roman Empire, the latter of which had been given to his father by Henry IV, Holy Roman Emperor.<br />
 <br />
He helped restore the Abbey of St. Maurice of Augane, in which the former kings of Burgundy had been crowned, and of which he himself was abbott until 1147. He also founded the Abbey of St. Sulpicius in Bugey, the Abbey of Tamié in the Bauges, and the Abbey of Hautecombe on the Lac du Bourget.<br />
 <br />
He had no children with his first wife Adelaide. In 1123 he married Mahaut (or Mafalda, or Matilda) of Albon, the sister of Guy IV of Dauphinois, with whom he had 10 children:<br />
       1. Elisa of Savoy (1120-?) married Humberto of Beaujeu<br />
       2. Mafalda (Mahaut), (b. 1125 - d. 1158), married Alfonso I of Portugal<br />
       3. Agnes of Savoy (1125-1172), married William I, Count of Geneva<br />
       4. Humbert III (1136-1188)<br />
       5. John of Savoy<br />
       6. Peter of Savoy<br />
       7. William of Savoy<br />
       8. Margaret of Savoy (died 1157)<br />
       9. Isabella of Savoy<br />
      10. Juliana of Savoy (died 1194), abbess of St. André-le-Haut<br />
 <br />
In 1128, Amadeus extended his realm, known as the "Old Chablais", by adding to it the region extending from the Arve to the Dranse d'Abondance, which came to be called the "New Chablais" with its capital at St. Moritz. Despite his marriage to Mahaut, he still fought against his brother-in-law Guy, who was killed at the Battle of Montmeillan. Following this, king Louis VI of France, married to Amadeus' sister Adélaide de Maurienne, attempted to confiscate Savoy. Amadeus was saved by the intercession of Peter the Hermit, and by his promise to participate in Louis' planned crusade.<br />
 <br />
In 1147, he accompanied his nephew Louis VII of France and his wife Eleanor of Aquitaine on the Second Crusade. He financed his expedition with help from a loan from the Abbey of St. Maurice. In his retinue were many barons from Savoy, including the lords of Faucigny, Seyssel, La Chambre, Miolans, Montbel, Thoire, Montmayeur, Vienne, Viry, La Palude, Blonay, Chevron-Villette, Chignin, and Châtillon. Amadeus travelled south through Italy to Brindisi, where he crossed over to Durazzo, and marched east along the Via Egnatia to meet Louis at Constantinople in late 1147. After crossing into Anatolia, Amadeus, who was leading the vanguard, became separated from Louis near Laodicea, and Louis' forces were almost entirely destroyed.<br />
 <br />
Marching on to Adalia, Louis, Amadeus, and other barons decided to continue to Antioch by ship. On the journey, Amadeus fell ill on Cyprus, and died at Nicosia in April of 1148. He was buried in the Church of St. Croix in Nicosia. In Savoy, his son Humbert III succeeded him, under the regency of bishop Amadeus of Lausanne.<br />

Rogneda of Polotsk (962-1002) is the Slavic name for Ragnhild, whosefather Ragnvald (Slavic: Rogvolod) came from overseas (i.e., fromScandinavia) and established himself at Polotsk in the mid-10th century.<br />
 <br />
It has been speculated that Ragnvald belonged to the Ynglings royal family of Norway. In or about 980, Vladimir of Novgorod, on learning that she was betrothed to his brother Yaropolk I of Kiev, took Polotsk and forced Rogneda to marry him. Having raped Rogneda in the presence of her parents, he ordered them to be killed, along with two of Rogneda's brothers.<br />
 <br />
Rogneda gave him several children. The four sons were Yaroslav the Wise, Vsevolod, Mstislav, and Izyaslav. She also bore two daughters, one of whom is named by Nestor the Chronicler as Predslava (taken as a concubine of Boleslaus I of Poland, according to Gallus). A later chronicle tells a story, most likely taken from a Norse saga, of Rogneda plotting against Vladimir and asking her elder son, Izyaslav, to kill him. As was the Norse royal custom, she was sent with her elder son to govern the land of her parents, i.e. Polotsk. Izyaslav's line continued to rule Polotsk and the newly-found town of Izyaslavl until the Mongol invasion.<br />
 <br />
There is another legend, that she became a nun and took the name Anastasia.<br />

Ingegerd Olofsdotter, born 1001 in Sigtuna, Sweden, was the daughter ofSwedish King Olof Skötkonung. She was engaged to be married to NorwegianKing Olaf II, but when Sweden and Norway got into a feud, Swedish KingOlof Skötkonung wouldn't allow for the marriage to happen.<br />
 <br />
Instead, her father quickly arranged with a marriage to the powerful Yaroslav I the Wise of Novgorod. Once in Russia, her name was changed to the Greek Irene. According to several sagas, she was given as a marriage gift Ladoga and adjacent lands, which later received the name Ingria (arguably a corruption of Ingigerd's name).<br />
 <br />
She initiated the building of the Saint Sophia Cathedral in Kiev that was supervised by her husband, who styled himself czar. They had six sons and four daughters, which became Queens of France, Hungary, Norway, and (arguably) England. The whole family is depicted in one of the frescoes of the Saint Sophia. Upon her death on 10 Feb. 1049, she was buried in the same cathedral.<br />
 <br />
Ingigerd-Irene is sometimes confused with Yaroslav's first wife, whose name was Anna. She was declared a local saint in Novgorod because of her initiative of building the Cathedral of St Sophia in Novgorod, where she is buried.<br />

The race to represent the 53rd District in the New York Senate pits a lifelong Elmira resident and two-term incumbent Republican against a Democratic challenger who is in his second term as mayor of Elmira and works in Ithaca.<br />
With a family tree that has grown in Elmira for generations, George H. Winner Jr., 59, wants to continue to serve the region where he has lived his whole life.<br />
His great-grandfather, William T. Henry, was pastor of First Baptist Church in Elmira when John Jones, after his underground railroad activities, was church sexton and usher. Grandfather Seth Winner was a Trout Run, Pa., native who came to Elmira and operated a haberdashery. Winnerʼs father was corporation counsel for the city of Elmira for close to 20 years.<br />
Winner himself studied sociology at St. Lawrence University - and sang in a menʼs a cappella group - and initially failed to get into law school. He landed a job for the areaʼs powerful state senator, William T. Smith, and became a law clerk until he passed the bar exam and began practicing law in 1977.<br />
The next year, he was elected to the Assembly, where he served 26 years until being elected to the Senate - and joining the Republican majority - in 2004.<br />

From Wikipedia,<br />
 <br />
Yaroslav I the Wise (978?-1054) (Christian name: Yury, or George) was thrice prince of Novgorod and Kiev, uniting the two principalities for a time under his rule. During his lengthy reign, Kievan Rus' reached a zenith of its cultural flowering and military power.<br />
 <br />
His way to the throne<br />
Early years of Yaroslav's life are enshrouded in mystery. He was one of the numerous sons of Vladimir the Great, presumably his second by Rogneda of Polotsk, although his actual age (as stated in the Russian Primary Chronicle and corroborated by the examination of his skeleton in the 1930s) would place him among the youngest children of Vladimir. It was speculated that he was a child begotten out of wedlock after Vladimir's divorce with Rogneda and his marriage to Anna Porphyrogeneta. Yaroslav figures prominently in the Norse Sagas under the name of Jarisleif the Lame; his legendary lameness (probably result of an arrow wound) was corroborated by the scientists who examined his relics.<br />
 <br />
In his youth, Yaroslav was sent by his father to rule the northern lands around Rostov the Great but was transferred to Novgorod the Great, as befitted a senior heir to the throne, in 1010. While living there, he founded the town of Yaroslavl (literally, Yaroslav's) on the Volga. His relations with father were apparently strained, and grew only worse on the news that Vladimir bequeathed the Kievan throne to his younger son, Boris. In 1014 Yaroslav refused to pay tribute to Kiev and only Vladimir's death prevented a war.<br />
 <br />
During the next four years Yaroslav waged a complicated and bloody war for Kiev against his half-brother Sviatopolk, who was supported by his father-in-law, king Boleslaus I of Poland. During the course of struggle, several other brothers (Boris and Gleb, Svyatoslav) were brutally murdered. The Primary Chronicle accused Svyatopolk of planning those murders, while the Saga of Eymund is often interpretated as recounting the story of Boris's assassination by the Varangians in the service of Yaroslav. However, the victim's name is given there as Burizlaf, which is also a name of Boleslaus I in the Scandinavian sources. It is thus possible that the Saga tells the story of Yaroslav's struggle against Svyatopolk (whose troops were commanded by the Polish king), and not against Boris.<br />
 <br />
Yaroslav defeated Svyatopolk in their first battle, in 1016, and Svyatopolk fled to Poland. But Svyatopolk returned with Polish troops furnished by his father-in-law King Boleslaus of Poland, seized Kiev and pushed Yaroslav back into Novgorod. In 1019, Yaroslav eventually prevailed over Svyatopolk and established his rule over Kiev. One of his first actions as a grand prince was to confer on the loyal Novgorodians (who had helped him to regain the throne), numerous freedoms and privilegies. Thus, the foundation for the Novgorod Republic was laid. The Novgorodians respected Yaroslav more than other Kievan princes and named a veche square after him. It is thought that it was at that period that Yaroslav promulgated the first Russian code of laws, called Yaroslav's Justice.<br />
 <br />
His reign<br />
Leaving aside the legitimacy of Yaroslav's claims to the Kievan throne and his postulated guilt in the murder of brothers, Nestor and later Russian historians often represented him as a model of virtue and styled him the Wise. A less appealing side of his personality may be revealed by the fact that he imprisoned his younger brother Sudislav for life. Yet another brother, Mstislav of Tmutarakan, whose distant realm bordered on the Northern Caucasus and the Black Sea, hastened to Kiev and inflicted a heavy defeat on Yaroslav in 1024. Thereupon Yaroslav and Mstislav divided Kievan Rus: the area stretching left from the Dnieper, with the capital at Chernihiv, was ceded to Mstislav until his death in 1036.<br />
 <br />
In his foreign policy, Yaroslav relied on the Scandinavian alliance and attempted to weaken the Byzantine influence on Kiev. In 1030 he reconquered from the Poles Red Rus, and concluded an alliance with king Casimir I the Restorer, sealed by the latter's marriage to Yaroslav's sister Maria. In another successful military raid the same year, he conquered the hypothetical Estonian fortress of Tarbatu, built his own fort in that place, which went by the name of Yuriev (after St George, or Yury, Yaroslav's patron saint) and forced the surrounding province of Ugaunia to pay annual tribute (possibly until 1061).<br />
 <br />
In 1043 Yaroslav staged a raid against Constantinople led by his son Vladimir. Although the Rus army was defeated, Yaroslav managed to conclude the war with a favourable treaty and prestigious marriage of his son Vsevolod to the emperor's daughter.<br />
 <br />
To defend his state from nomadic tribes threatening it from the south he constructed a line of fortifications near the towns of Chersones, Kanev and Pereyaslav. To celebrate his decisive victory over the Pechenegs (who thereupon disappear from history) he sponsored the construction of the Saint Sophia Cathedral in 1037. Other celebrated monuments of his reign, such as the Golden Gates of Kiev, have since perished.<br />
 <br />
Yaroslav was a notable patron of book culture and learning. In 1051, he had a Russian monk Ilarion proclaimed the metropolitan of Kiev, thus challenging old Byzantine tradition of placing Greeks on the episcopal sees. Ilarion's discourse on Yaroslav and his father Vladimir is frequently cited as the first work of Old Russian literature.<br />
 <br />
Family life and posterity<br />
In 1019, Yaroslav married Ingegerd Olofsdotter, daughter of king of Sweden, and gave Ladoga to her as a marriage gift. There are good reasons to believe that before that time he had been married to a woman named Anna, of disputed extraction.<br />
 <br />
In the Saint Sophia Cathedral, one may see a fresco representing the whole family: Yaroslav, Irene (as Ingigerd was known in Rus), their 5 daughters and 5 sons. Yaroslav married three of his daughters to foreign princes who lived in exile at his court: Elizabeth to Harald III of Norway (who had attained her hand by his military exploits in the Byzantine Empire); Anastasia to the future Andrew I of Hungary, and the youngest daughter Anne of Kiev married Henry I of France and was the regent of France during their son's minority. Another daughter may have been the Agatha who married Edward the Exile, heir to the throne of England and was the mother of Edgar Atheling and St. Margaret of Scotland.<br />
 <br />
Yaroslav had one son from the first marriage (his Christian name being Ilya), and 6 sons from the second marriage. Apprehending the danger that could ensue from divisions between brothers, he exhorted them to live in peace with each other. The eldest of these, Vladimir of Novgorod, best remembered for building the Saint Sophia Cathedral in Novgorod, predeceased his father. Three other sons - Izyaslav, Svyatoslav, and Vsevolod - reigned in Kiev one after another. The youngest children of Yaroslav were Igor of Volynia and Vyacheslav of Smolensk.<br />

Anthony was the son of Nicholas Snow Sr. and Elizabeth Rowelles. Hemarried Abigail Warren on November 8, 1639 in Plymouth, Plymouth County,Massachusetts. To this union, 6 children were born.<br />
Nicholas Snow and his brothers, Anthony and William came from England in the year 1623 on the ship Ann, said to be the second ship to arrive in Plymouth after the Mayflower.<br />
Abigail, when she married Anthony Snow of Plymouth, received as a marriage portion from her mother, 9 Jan 1639, a deed for her "house situated near the place called Wellingsley (alis) Hobshole, with the eight acres of land thereunto adjoining." Shortly after marriage Mr. Snow removed to Marshfield, where he became one of the leading citizens of the town; was surveyor of highways in 1651, constable 1652, representative to the General Court of Plymouth Colony in 1656 and twenty years following, selectman in 1666 and afterwards several years, collector of the excise 3 June 1668, and member of the Plymouth Council-of-War for Plymouth Colony in 1675. Sometime before his death he gave to the town a piece of land near the meeting house for a grave yard, where he is buried and which is still in use. His will dated 28 Dec 1685, with codicil of 8 August 1692, named wife Abigail, and children given below. Inventory of his estate taken 12 Nov 1692.<br />
Anthony Snow was one of the last Marshfield downtown settlers for whom Snow Road is named. He received one-half of the Thomas Prence grant in 1649. The parcel included a part of Cedar Grove Cemetery that Snow gave to the town and the swamp (Snow's Swamp) where much of the shopping and parking areas are today. It also included land along Ocean Street easterly as far at the Bourne grant (near Bourne Park Avenue). This flat land between the rivers were meadows and streams, wetlands, and swamps. Anthony Snow was a feltmaker by trade. He farmed and fished, served as a constable and a deputy to the court, contributed a barrel of beef toward the purchase of Bulkley's parsonage and served as one of the towns first selectmen on 5 Apr 1667. Many of downtown Marshfield businesses today are build on the land that belong to Anthony Snow.<br />
Anthony Snow's will dated 8 Dec 1685 is in possession of the Connecticut Historical Society at Hartford, CT.<br />
Buried at the Winslow Cemetery in Marshfield, Plymouth County, Massachusetts. This cemetery is also know  as the Old Winslow Burying Ground<br />
There is a large mounment in this Cemetery as well, which Anthony and his wife, Abigail, names appears. It is dedicated to early settlers of Green Harbor, Massachusetts.<br />

After Earl Simon's [Matilda's 1st husband] death, his Widow married David I of Scotland, who consequently became Earl of Huntingdon too, keeping the Earldom even after he succeeded his brother as King of Scots. He sided with the Empress Maud against Stephen I but came to terms with the latter and made the Earldom over to his son Henry. Henry swore fealty to Stephen but subsequently fought against him under the Scottish banner,which may account for Simon de St Liz's son, another Simon, being recognized as Earl of Huntingdon before Henry's death in 1152.

Robert de Ros or Roos of Fursan (1177 - December 11, 1226) was the fourthbaron by tenure of Hamlake manor (later associated with the barony of deRos).<br />
 <br />
He was the son of Everard de Ros and Rose Trusbut. In 1191, aged fourteen, he paid a thousand marks fine for livery of his lands to King Richard I of England. In 1191, he married Isabel Avenal, an illegitimate daughter of William the Lion, King of Scotland and Isabel Avenal. In 1197, while serving King Richard in Normandy, he was arrested for an unspecified offence, and was committed to the custody of Hugh de Chaumont, but Chaumont entrusted his prisoner to William de Spiney, who allowed him to escape from the castle of Bonville. King Richard thereupon hanged Spiney and collected a fine of twelve hundred marks from Ros' guardian as the price of his continued freedom.<br />
 <br />
When King John came to the throne, he gave Ros the barony of his great-grandmother's father, Walter dʼEspec. Soon afterwards he was deputed one of those to escort William the Lion, his father-in-law, into England, to swear fealty to King John. Some years later, Robert de Ros assumed the habit of a monk, whereupon the custody of all his lands and Castle Werke, in Northumberland, were committed to Philip d'Ulcote, but he soon returned and about a year later he was High Sheriff of County Cumberland.<br />
 <br />
When the struggle of the barons for a constitutional government began, de Ros at first sided with King John, and thus obtained some valuable grants from the crown, and was made governor of Carlisle; but he subsequently went over to the barons and became one of the celebrated twenty-five "Sureties" appointed to enforce the observance of Magna Carta, the county of Northumberland being placed under his supervision. He gave his allegiance to King Henry III and, in 1217-18, his manors were restored to him. Although he was witness to the second Great Charter and the Forest Charter, of 1224, he seems to have remained in royal favour.<br />
 <br />
He erected Helmsley or Hamlake Castle in Yorkshire, and of Werke in Northumberland. Sir Robert is buried at Knightʼs Church, London. Among their children was Sir William de Ros.<br />

Following a brief illness of less than a week with pneumonia, Mrs. J. C. Brinker, one of the well known residents of this city, died suddenly at her home on North Front Street early Wednesday afternoon about 1:15 o'clock.  Mrs. Brinker had been suffering from a cold for a few weeks but had only been confined to her home for five days.

Mrs. Brinker, whose maiden name was Margaret Koch, was born in Goodhue county 50 year ago on July 27, 1874, and grew to womanhood there.  On August 2, 1905, she was united in marriage to John C. Brinker at Litchfield, Minn.  The couple located in various parts of Wisconsin, where Mr. Brinker established woolen mills.  Later they moved to Fergus Falls, then to La Crosse, Wis., and in the summer of 1912 came to this city.  They purchased the Saint Peter Woolen Mills, which they have since operated.  Mrs. Brinker assisted materially in the establishment of their lucrative business here and was a capable business woman.<br />
During her residence here, she was an active member of the M. E. church and of the Ladies' Aid. Fraternally, she was a member of the Hazel Rebekah Lodge No. 31, I.O.O.F., of Fergus Falls.

William I (William the Lion, William Leo, William Dunkeld or WilliamCanmore), (1142/1143 - December 4, 1214) reigned as King of Scotland from1165 to 1214. His reign was the longest in Scottish history before theAct of Union with England in 1707. He became King following his brotherMalcolm IV's death on 9 December 1165 and was crowned on 24 December 1165.<br />
 <br />
Traditionally, William founded Arbroath Abbey, the site of the later Declaration of Arbroath. Interestingly, he was not known as "The Lyon" during his own lifetime, and the sobriquet did not relate to his tenacious character or his military prowess. The name "The Lion" became attached to him because of his flag or standard, a red lion rampant on a yellow background. This went on to become the Royal standard of Scotland; the British Monarch when in Scotland still uses it today. The rampant lion also forms part of the Royal Standard of the United Kingdom.<br />
 <br />
William also arranged the Auld Alliance, the first treaty for mutual self-defence between nations. Scotland, France, and Norway subscribed to the treaty. Although Norway never took much part in it, it played a role in Franco-Scottish (and English) affairs until 1746.<br />
 <br />
William also inherited the title of Earl of Northumbria in 1152. However he had to give up this title to King Henry II of England in 1157. This caused trouble after William became king, since he spent a lot of effort trying to regain Northumbria.<br />
 <br />
William was a key rebel in the Revolt of 1173-1174 against Henry II. In 1174, during a raid in support of the revolt William was captured by Henry's troops and taken in chains to Northampton, and then transferred to Falaise in Normandy. Henry then sent an army to Scotland and occupied it. As ransom and to regain his kingdom, William had to acknowledge Henry as his feudal superior and agree to pay for the cost of the English army's occupation of Scotland by taxing the Scots. This he did by signing the Treaty of Falaise. He was then allowed to return to Scotland.<br />
 <br />
The Treaty of Falaise remained in force for the next fifteen years. At the end of that time the new English king, Richard the Lionheart, agreed to terminate it in return for 10,000 silver marks. Richard needed the money to take part in the Third Crusade.<br />
 <br />
Because of his need for an alliance with England, William married Ermengarde de Beaumont, a granddaughter of King Henry I of England, in 1186. The marriage was not very successful, and it was many years before an heir, Alexander, was born. William and Ermengarde's children were:<br />
   1. Margaret (1193-1259), married Hubert de Burgh, 1st Earl of Kent.<br />
   2. Isabella (1195-1253), married Roger Bigod, 4th Earl of Norfolk.<br />
   3. Alexander II of Scotland (1198-1249), reigned 1214-1249.<br />
   4. Marjorie (1200-1244), married Gilbert Marshal, 4th Earl of Pembroke.<br />
 <br />
 <br />
William died in Stirling in 1214 and lies buried in Arbroath Abbey. His son, Alexander II, succeeded him as king.<br />
 <br />
----------------------------------------------------------<br />
William "The Lion" was a grandson of King David I and came to the throne after the death of his elder brother, Malcolm IV in 1165. The nickname "The Lion" was accorded to him after his death and may have been due either to his valour and strength in battle (though he was not always successful) or, more likely, to the heraldic symbol which he adopted - the red lion rampant on a yellow background - which has remained a royal symbol to this day.<br />
 <br />
William was crowned at Scone on December 24, 1165 at the age of 22 and was to reign for nearly 50 years - a prodigious length of time by any standards, but unheard of in those violent days.<br />
 <br />
William was red-haired and energetic. Early in his reign he attempted to recover land in Northumberland which had been given to King David in 1149 by King Stephen of England but which had been ceded by his brother Malcolm. The stories of his butchery of the local population were chronicled in detail by later (English) historians. However, he was ultimately unsuccessful as he was surprised by an attack by the English army while besieging Alnwick castle. In the mist, he mistook a party of English knights for his own. He is said to have fought fearlessly but his horse was speared and he was captured. He spent five months as a prisoner of Henry II while the English army plundered the south of Scotland as far as Edinburgh.<br />
 <br />
William was only released under the Treaty of Falaise. Under this, William was forced to swear allegiance to King Henry II of England and English garrisons remained in the castles which had been captured. This lasted until after Henry's death in 1189. At that stage he was able to negotiate out of the oath by providing money to King Richard (the Lionheart) who needed finance to go on a crusade to the Holy Land.<br />
 <br />
In 1178 William founded the Abbey of Arbroath which was dedicated to Thomas à Becket who had been murdered by Henry II in 1170. The Abbey was later to be place where the famous "Declaration of Arbroath" was signed in 1320 by the Scottish nobles in the time of Robert the Bruce.<br />
 <br />
William failed to assert his authority over the rebellious south-west of Scotland. This was not helped by the fact that he had to first ask permission of his "liege-lord" Henry to be allowed to deal with the matter. William captured one of the ring-leaders but had to send him to Henry to be dealt with. Henry demand an oath of loyalty - and promptly returned the outlaw to Galloway where he immediately attacked William's garrison.<br />
 <br />
William is known to have been planning another invasion of England to retake Northumberland early in the 13th century after King John came to the throne of England and there were a number of skirmishes along the border. But he eventually negotiated a treaty instead - he is said to have had a "divine warning" of the consequences of invasion.<br />
 <br />
In 1186 William married Ermengarde de Beaumont who at last bore him a son in 1198 (later King Alexander II) when William was aged 53. He also had three daughters (all of whom married English nobles as part of the peacemaking process with King John of England).<br />

From Wikipedia<br />
 <br />
William de Valence, 1st Earl of Pembroke (d. May 16, 1296) was a French nobleman, who became important in English politics due to his relationship to Henry III.<br />
 <br />
He was the fourth son of Isabella of Angouleme, widow of king John of England, and her second husband, Hugh X of Lusignan, count of La Marche, and was thus a half-brother to Henry III of England, and uncle to Edward I of England.<br />
 <br />
The French conquest of Poitou in 1246 created great difficulties for William's family, and so he and several of his brother's accepted Henry III's invitation to come to England in 1247. The king found important positions for all of them; William was soon married to a great heiress, Joan de Munchesni, only surviving child of Warin de Muchensi and Joan, daughter and eventual co-heiress of William Marshal, 4th Earl of Pembroke. Her portion of the Marshal estates included the castle and lordship of Pembroke and the lordship of Wexford in Ireland.<br />
 <br />
This favoritism to royal relatives was one of the matters that set off the Barons' War, and in 1258 William was driven out of England. He returned 3 years later after Henry III repudiated the Provisions of Oxford, and fought on the royalist side at the Battle of Lewes. After the battle he fled to Pembroke, where he raised forces that led to the final defeat of the barons at the Battle of Evesham.<br />
 <br />
In his later years William accompanied his nephew Edward (later Edward I) on pilgrimage to the Holy Land, and from his base in Pembrokeshire was a mainstay of the English fights against the Welsh princes.<br />
 <br />
Though he is sometimes called earl in contemporary documents, it is uncertain when if ever William was formally created or recognized as Earl of Pembroke.<br />
 <br />
William and Joan de Muchesni (described above) had three children:<br />
    * Aymer de Valence, 2nd Earl of Pembroke<br />
    * Isabel, who married John, 1st Lord Hastings. Their grandson Lawrence later became earl of Pembroke<br />
    * Joan, who married John Comyn<br />

Henry de Beaumont, 1st Earl of Warwick, so created between July andDec1088 and granted lands which up till two years previously had belongedtoa Saxon Thane, Turkill or Turchil of Arden (an ancestor of WilliamShakespeare); born c1048; granted feudal Lordship of Gower, South WalesbyHenry I some time between 1106 and 1116 and died most probably 20June1119. [Burke's Peerage]<br />
 <br />
The first who bore the title of Earl of Warwick, after the Norman Conquest, was Henry de Newburgh (so called from the castle of that name in Normandy), a younger son of Roger de Bellomont, Earl of Mellent. Whenthis eminent person obtained that earldom is not exactly ascertained, but Sir William Dugdale presumed the period to be toward the close of the Conqueror's reign, "for then," saith he, "King William, having begirt Warwick with a mighty ditch, for the precinct of its walls, and erected the gates at his own charge, did promote this Henry to the earldom, and annexed thereto the royalty of the borough, which at that time belonged to the crown." But, though Henry de Newburgh was made Earl of Warwick by the first Norman sovereign, he was not invested with all the lands attached to the earldom until the ensuing reign, as we find William Rufus, soon after his accession to the throne, conferring upon him the whole inheritance of Turchil de Warwick, a Saxon, who, at the coming of Duke William, had the reputation of earl; and thenceforth the "bear and ragged staff," the device of Turchil's family derived from the chivalrous Guy, Earl of Warwick, was assumed by the first of the Newburgh dynasty, and it has been continued ever since as a badge of the successive Earls of Warwick. The name of this Henry, Earl of Warwick, appears as a witness to the charter of King Henry I, whereby that prince confirmed the laws of Edward the Confessor, and granted many other immunities to the clergy and laity. His lordship m. Margaret, dau. of Geffrey, Count de Moreton, and sister of Rotrode, Earl of Perch, and had issue, two daus., whose names are not mentioned, and five sons, viz., Roger, his successor; Henry; Geffrey; Rotrode, bishop of Evreux; and Robert, seneschal and justice of Normandy, who was a great benefactor to the abbey of Bec in which he was afterwards shorn a monk and d. in 1123.<br />
 <br />
This Earl Henry commenced imparking Wedgenock, near his castle of Warwick, following the example of his sovereign, King Henry, who made the first park that had ever been in England, at Woodstock. His lordship, who was as memorable for pious foundations as distinguished for military achievements, d. in 1123 and was s. by his eldest son, Roger de Newburgh.[Sir Bernard Burke, Dormant, Abeyant, Forfeited and Extinct Peerages, Burke's Peerage, Ltd., London, 1883, p. 399, Newburgh, Earls of Warwick]<br />
 <br />
The earldom of Warwick was created by William II in 1088 for Henry de Beaumont, who had held Warwick castle since its building by William the Conqueror 20 years before.<br />
 <br />
Henry, younger brother of Robert, count of Meulan, was lord of Neubourg, near Beaumont-le-Roger in Normandy, and Rufus gave him the great midland estate of the English noble, Thurkill of Arden. The new earl was an intimate friend of Henry I, whose succession he did much to promote. He died in 1123 and was buried at Preaux (Normandy). Roger, his eldest son, held the earldom until his death in 1153. [Encyclopædia Britannica, 1961ed., Vol. 23, p. 375, EARLS OF WARWICK]<br />

From Wikipedia<br />
 <br />
Otto I the Great (November 23, 912 - May 7, 973), son of Henry I the Fowler, king of the Germans, and Matilda of Ringelheim, was Duke of Saxony, King of the Germans and arguably the first Holy Roman Emperor. (While Charlemagne had been crowned emperor in 800, his empire was divided amongst his grandsons, and following the assassination of Berengar of Friuli in 924, the imperial title lay vacant for nearly forty years.)<br />
 <br />
Early reign<br />
Otto succeeded his father as king of the Germans in 936. He arranged for his coronation to be held in Charlemagne's former capital, Aachen. According to the Saxon historian Widukind of Corvey, at his coronation banquet he had the four other dukes of the empire, those of Franconia, Swabia, Bavaria and Lorraine, act as his personal attendants, Arnulf I of Bavaria as marshall (or stablemaster), Herman of Swabia as cupbearer (lat. pincerna or buticularius), Eberhard III of Franconia as steward, and Gilbert of Lorraine as chamberlain.<br />
 <br />
In 938, a rich vein of silver was discovered at the Rammelsberg in Saxony. This ore body would provide much of Europe's silver, copper, and lead for the next two hundred years, and this mineral wealth helped fund Otto's activities throughout his reign.<br />
 <br />
Otto's early reign was marked by a series of ducal revolts. In 938, Eberhard, the new duke of Bavaria, refused to pay Otto homage. When Otto deposed him in favor of his uncle Berthold, Eberhard of Franconia revolted, together with several of the Saxon nobility, who tried to depose Otto in favor of his elder half-brother Thankmar (son of Henry's first wife Hatheburg). While Otto was able to defeat and kill Thankmar in 936, the revolt continued the next year when Gilbert, the Duke of Lorraine, swore fealty to King Louis IV of France. Meanwhile, Otto's younger brother Henry conspired with the Archbishop of Mainz to assassinate him. The rebellion ended in 939 with Otto's victory at the Battle of Andernach, where the dukes of Franconia and Lorraine both perished. Henry fled to France, and Otto responded by supporting Hugh the Great in his campaign against the French crown, but in 941 Otto and Henry were reconciled through the efforts of their mother, and the next year Otto withdrew from France after Louis recognized his suzerainty over Lorraine.<br />
 <br />
To prevent further revolts, Otto arranged for all the important duchies in the German kingdom to be held by close family members. He kept the now-vacant duchy of Franconia as a personal fiefdom, while in 944 he bestowed the duchy of Lorraine upon Conrad the Red, who later married his daughter Liutgard. Meanwhile, he arranged for his son Liutdolf to marry Ida, the daughter of Duke Herman of Swabia, and to inherit that duchy when Herman died in 947. A similar arrangement led to Henry becoming duke of Bavaria in 949.<br />
 <br />
Campaigns in Italy and eastern Europe<br />
Meanwhile, Italy had fallen into political chaos. On the death (950), possibly by poisoning, of Lothair of Arles, the Italian throne was inherited by a woman, Adelaide of Italy, the respective daughter, daughter-in-law, and widow of the last three kings of Italy. A local noble, Berengar of Ivrea, declared himself king of Italy, abducted Adelaide, and tried to legitimize his reign by forcing Adelaide to marry his son Adalbert. However, Adelaide escaped to Canossa and requested German intervention. Ludolf and Henry independently invaded northern Italy to take advantage of the situation, but in 951 Otto frustrated his son's and his brother's ambitions by invading Italy himself, forcing Berengar to swear fealty, and then, having been widowed since 946, marrying Adelaide.<br />
 <br />
This marriage triggered another revolt. When Adelaide bore a son, Ludolf feared for his position as Otto's heir, and in 953 he rebelled in league with Conrad the Red and the Archbishop of Mainz. While Otto was initially successful in reasserting his authority in Lorraine, he was captured while attacking Mainz, and by the next year, the rebellion had spread throughout the kingdom. However, Conrad and Ludolf erred by allying themselves with the Magyars. Extensive Magyar raids in southern Germany in 954 compelled the German nobles to reunite, and at the Diet of Auerstadt, Conrad and Ludolf were stripped of their titles and Otto's authority reestablished. In 955, Otto cemented his authority by routing Magyar forces at the Battle of Lechfeld.<br />
 <br />
The Ottonian system<br />
A key part of Otto's domestic policy lay in strengthening ecclesiastical authorities, chiefly bishops and abbots, at the expense of the secular nobility. Otto endowed the bishoprics and abbeys with large tracts of land, over which secular authorities had neither the power of taxation nor legal jurisdiction. In an extreme example, when Conrad the Red was stripped of his ducal title in Lorraine, he appointed his brother Bruno, already the Archbishop of Cologne as the new duke of Lorraine. In the lands Otto conquered from the Wends and other Slavic peoples on his eastern borders, he founded several new bishoprics.<br />
 <br />
Because Otto personally appointed the bishops, these reforms strengthened his central authority, and the upper ranks of the German church functioned in some respect as an arm of the imperial bureaucracy. Conflict between Otto's successors and the growing power of the Papacy over these powerful bishoprics would, however, eventually lead to the Investiture Conflict and the undoing of central authority in Germany.<br />
 <br />
Imperial title<br />
In the early 960s, Italy was again in political turmoil, and when Berengar occupied the northern Papal States, Pope John XII asked Otto for assistance. Otto returned to Italy and on February 2, 962, the pope crowned him emperor. (Translatio imperii.) Ten days later, the pope and emperor ratified the Diploma Ottonianum, in which the emperor became the guarantor of the independence of the papal states. After Otto left Rome and reconquered the Papal States from Berengar, however, John became fearful of the emperor's power and sent envoys to the Magyars and the Byzantine Empire to form a league against Otto. In November of 963, Otto returned to Rome and convened a synod of bishops that deposed John and crowned Leo VIII, at that time a layman, as pope. When the emperor left Rome, however, civil war broke out in the city between those who supported the emperor and those who supported John. John returned to power amidst great bloodshed and excommunicated those who had deposed him, forcing Otto to return to Rome a third time in July of 964 to depose Pope Benedict V (John having died two months earlier). On this occasion, Otto extracted from the citizens of Rome a promise not to elect a pope without imperial approval.<br />
 <br />
Otto unsuccessfully campaigned in southern Italy on several occasions from 966-972, although in 972, the Byzantine emperor John I Tzimisces recognized Otto's imperial title and agreed to a marriage between Otto's son and heir Otto II and his niece Theophano.<br />
 <br />
After his death in 973 he was buried next to his first wife Editha of Wessex in the Cathedral of Magdeburg.<br />

"CONGRATULATED ON 84TH BIRTHDAY<br />
Mrs. E.W. Knowlton of Cambridge Station recently celebrated her eight-fourth birthday by attending the seventieth anniversary of the founding of the Little White Church at Cambridge Station.<br />
She was born and married in the same house, built by her grandfather's hands - and her father, John Webster, was beloved by all for miles around. She spent her life in Cambridge, with the exception of spending the winters with her daughter, Mrs. (Dr.) Skinner, of Mahone Bay, since the death of her husband in October, 1934. Just before his death they celebrated their "golden wedding" by having 74 callers in the afternoon, and 21 in evening, when Mr. Knowlton bravely sat with her under an arch of lilacs and apple blossoms (the same kind of flowers the arch was made from at the time of their marriage).<br />
Through any trial and suffering she has always shown an unfaltering faith in her God, and in mankind.<br />
When her sons were overseas in the last war Mrs. Knowlton never heard the telephone ring but she thought "My boy has gone." And when her husband saw anyone running towards the mill he always thought "The lad's been killed." Incidentally they had the first telephone to be installed in Cambridge.<br />
She has loved her family with a true devotion, and yet found the time to crochet little gifts for folks for miles around every Christmas or birthday. Her own birthday is a sacred day for her, and she loves to be home among her own dear neighbors who have loved her down through the years and have found many kindly ways of showing that love.<br />
One day an old man came in to use the telephone - he had never seen one before - and when the voice he knew answered him at the other end he turned to Mrs. Knowlton and said "Why I hear him - I hear him."<br />
Mrs. Knowlton has been treasurer of the Ladies' Aid since its inception in 1913, only relinquishing her duties, pro tem, while she is with her daughter winters.<br />
Folks for miles around lovingly call her "Aunt Min," and all wish her many more years of useful activity and cheery ways among us."<br />

Sir Bartholomew de Burghersh (died August 3, 1355) was the son of Sir Robert de Burghersh (Lord Warden of the Cinque Ports 1299-1306) by Maud (nee de Badlesmere).<br />
 <br />
Bartholomew was born some time between 1287 and 1296. He succeeded his father as Lord Burghersh, upon the death of the first lord's eldest son, Bartholomew's brother, Stephen de Burghersh, in 1310. His other, younger brother was Henry de Burghersh (1292-1340), chancellor of England in 1328, and treasurer of England from 1334 to 1337.<br />
 <br />
Before June 11, 1320, he married Elizabeth, daughter of Sir Theobald de Verdun, Lord Verdun, (Justiciar of Ireland) by Maud de Mortimer.<br />
 <br />
Bartholomew de Burghersh served in the Scottish wars, and was with the Earl of Lancaster at the Battle of Boroughbridge (March 16, 1321/2), but was captured and taken as a prisoner. On August 25, 1346, he served Edward III at the Battle of Crecy both as a diplomat and a soldier, as did his son. Following this battle, many nobles were ransomed, and it is clear De Burghersh was at length released as he later served the king as a Constable of Dover Castle, and Lord Warden of the Cinque Ports, like his father before him. Bartholomew Burghersh (? - August 1351), brother of bishop Henry Burghersh became Baron Burghersh on the death of his brother Stephen in 1310.<br />
 <br />
He acted as assistant to Badlesmere until the execution of the latter; and then, trusted by Edward III, was constable of Dover Castle and warden of the Cinque Ports.<br />
 <br />
--------------------------------------------------------------------------  ------------<br />
 <br />
He acted as assistant to the first Lord Baron de Badlemere (b1274-5), his uncle, Lord Warden from 1320 until the execution of Badlesmere by the method of the time in 1322 when he was hanged, drawn & quartered (14th April) at Canterbury, in Kent; and having proven his trust to the king, was made constable of Dover Castle and Lord Warden of the Cinque Ports.<br />
 <br />
He served in this capacity in 1327 and 1343, and again between the years 1346-50. In addition to these duties he was also to serve as the Constable of the Tower of London beginning on the 27th of June 1355, a post he kept until his death.<br />
 <br />
Bartholomew de Burghersh was then Lord Warden of the Cinque Ports in the year of 1348, when:<br />
 <br />
"On 18th May by an inquisition taken by Bartholomew de Burghersh, Warden of the Cinque Ports, Parson Holbourne as rector of Rye was granted a place called Courton, where the pleus affecting the town are now held, adjoining the church yard and "of ancient time ordained there for a dwelling of the Parson of that church". Here was built the first Rectory House on the same site as it occupies today some 645 years later". (703 AD).<br />
 <br />
(Note: The Rector of Minster in Thanet from the 1430ʼs was William Holbourn, who was transferred to the living of the parish of Brooke as Rector of Woodnesborough, Canterbury during the 1470ʼs.)<br />
 <br />
Ref:<br />
Fragments of the History of The Old Vicarage, Rye. (poss. in google cashe?)<br />
 <br />
In 1340, Bartholomew became an heir to some lands held by one of his brothers, Henry de Burghersh, the Bishop of Lincoln and Lord Treasurer. Bartholomew de Burghersh was summoned to attend Parliament from the 25th of January, 1329 and served until the 15th of March in 1354: (25 years).<br />
 <br />
Bartholomew de Burghersh acted as a 'Banneret in 1341, and in the August of 1343, he formed part of an important embassy to the Pope' and later was to become Chamberlain of the royal Household.<br />
 <br />
His widow survived him by some five years. The son of Bartholomew de Burghersh by Elizabeth de Verdun, and third lord de Burghersh was also named Bartholomew. This Sir Bartholomew de Burghersh was one of the first 25 original Knights of the Garter, and 'earned a great reputation as a soldier, especially distinguishing himself at the Battle of Poitiers' (September 19, 1356). A companion of the Black Prince (Edward) in most of his expeditions he was one of the most renound soldiers of the period.<br />
 <br />
His daughter by Cecily de Weyland was named Elizabeth, and married Sir Edward le Despenser, KG (before December, 1364), the son of Sir Edward le Despenser by Anne de Ferrers. It was said that he died 'retaining to the last the royal confidence'.<br />

What are the sources for HERBERT FITZHERBERT being 'dead by 1155' and 'was dead in 1165'? He appears to have been alive and witnessing at least two deeds after 1170. Both deeds are for Herbert FitzHerbert's half-brother Reginald, Earl of Cornwall, (Deeds of the Redvers family, App II, 15a and 15b.)<br />

Herbert Fitz Herbert who married Sibyl Corbet and died in 1154, or at least by 1165, was FATHER of another Herbert Fitz Herbert. The younger man was living in 1165, and died about 1235.

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia.<br />
 <br />
Cunedda ap Edern (c.AD 386-c.460; reigned from the 440s or 450s) (Latin: Cunetacius; English: Kenneth), also known as as Cunedda Wledig ('the Imperator'), was an important early Welsh leader, and the progenitor of the royal dynasty of Gwynedd.<br />
 <br />
The name 'Cunedda' derives from the Brythonic word counodagos, meaning 'good lord'. His genealogy is traced back to Padarn Beisrudd, which literally translated as Paternus of the Scarlet Robe. One traditional interpretation identifies Padarn as a Roman (or Romano-British) official of reasonably high rank who had been placed in command of Votadini troops stationed in the Clackmannanshire region of Scotland in the 380s or earlier by the Emperor Magnus Maximus. Alternatively, he may have been a frontier chieftain who was granted Roman military rank, a practice attested elsewhere along the empire's borders at the time. In all likelihood, Padarn's command in Scotland was assumed after his death by his son, Edern (in Latin, Aeturnus), and then passed to Edern's son, Cunedda.<br />
 <br />
Cunedda and his forebears led the Votadini against Pictish and Irish incursions south of Hadrian's Wall. Sometime after this, the Votadini troops under Cunedda relocated to North Wales in order to defend the region from Irish invasion. Cunedda established himself in Wales, in the territory of the Venedotians, which would become the centre of the kingdom of Gwynedd. Two explanations for these actions have been suggested: either Cunedda was acting under the orders of Maximus (or Maximus's successors) or Vortigern, the high king of the British in the immediate post-Roman era. The range of dates (suggested by PC Bartrum) runs from the late 370s, which would favor Maximus, to the late 440s, which would favor Vortigern.<br />
 <br />
The suggestion that Cunedda was operating under instructions from Rome has been challenged by several historians. David Dumville dismisses the whole concept of transplanting foederati from Scotland to Wales in this manner, especially given the political state of sub-Roman Britain which may not have been able to exhibit such centralised control by the fifth century. As Maximus himself was dead by the end of 388, and Constantine III departed from Britain with the last of Rome's military forces in 407, less than a generation later, it is doubtful that Rome had much direct influence over the military actions of the Votadini, either through Maximus or any other emissary, for any significant length of time.<br />
 <br />
Maximus (or his successors) may have handed over control of the British frontiers to local chieftains at an earlier date; with the evacuation of the fort at Chester (which Mike Ashley, incidentally, argues is most likely where Cunedda established his initial base in the region, some years later) in the 370s, he may have little option. Given that the archaeological record demonstrates Irish settlement on the Lleyn peninsula however and possible raids as far west as Wroxeter by the late 4th century, it is difficult to conceive of either Roman or allied British forces having presented an effective defence in Wales.<br />
 <br />
Academics such as Sheppard Frere have argued that it may have been Vortigern who, adopting elements of Roman statecraft, moved the Votadini south, just as he invited Saxon settlers to protect other parts of the island. According to this version of events, Vortigern would have instructed Cunedda and his Votadini subjects to move to Wales in response to the aforementioned Irish incursions no later than the year 442, when Vortigern's former Saxon allies rebelled against his rule.<br />
 <br />
Cunedda's supposed grandson Maelgwn Hir ap Cadwallon was a contemporary of Gildas, and according to the Annales Cambriae died in 547. The reliability of early Welsh genealogies is not uncontested however, and many of the claims regarding the number and identity of Cunedda's heirs did not surface until as late as the 10th century. Nonetheless, if we accept this information as valid, calculating back from this date suggests the mid-5th century interpretation.<br />
 <br />
Of Cunedda personally even less is known. Probably celebrated for his strength, courage, and ability to rally the beleaguered Romano-British forces of the region, he eventually secured a politically advantageous marriage to Gwawl, daughter of Coel Hen, the Romano-British ruler of Eboracum (modern York), and is claimed to have had nine sons. Cardigan (Welsh: Ceredigion) and Merioneth (Welsh: Meirionydd) were supposedly named after his two sons Ceredig and Meirion.<br />

Einion ap Cunedda (c.420 - 500; reigned from the 470s) (Latin: Engenius;English: Enoch), also known as Einion Yrth ('the Impetuous') was a kingof Gwynedd. One of the sons of Cunedda, it is believed he traveled withhis father to North Wales in the early 450s to expel Irish raiders fromthe region. After his father's death, Einion inherited control over thenewly founded kingdom of Gwynedd. Aided by his brother Ceredig, ruler ofCeredigion, and his nephew Meirion, ruler of Meirionnydd, Einion builtupon his father's successes and further established his family's rule inthe region.<br />

Roger Filius Richardi de Wrkewrthe, a 'nepos' of Earl Hugh Bigod, according to his brother-in-law William de Vere in his Miracles of St Osyth. This description may indicate that his father Richard married an otherwise unknown daughter of Roger Bigod, though it is equally possible that the lady in question was a sister or niece of Roger Bigod. The only other hint as to his family comes from the same source, where he is given an uncle Thomas de Candelent; see C Clay, 'The ancestry of the early lords of Warkworth', Archaeologia Aeliana, 4th ser. 32 (1954), 65-71. Clay suggested we read 'Candelent' as Canteloup, the name of a family later found in the area; cf Walter de Canteloup, one of the two persons holding in 1166 from de Mandeville the Domesday fief of Germund de St Ouen. However, 'Candelent' is the Latin form found in Domesday for the manor of Candlet in Suffolk, which the Englishman Norman the Sheriff held of Roger Bigod in 1086. Roger's charter for Rochester made a grant for Norman's soul as Roger and his wife's predecessor in manors they were granting. Could it be that a family link had been forged between the Bigods and the issue of Norman? Roger fitz Roger was granted Warkworth in Northumberland in 1157 by Henry II; he returned a Carta for one fee held in chief in 1166. His wife was Adelisa, daughter of Alberic II de Ver, previously wife of Robert of Essex, probably a brother of Henry of Essex. Father of Robert fitz Roger, who acquired the barony of Whalton, Northumberland, a second son, and Alice, wife of John, constable of Chester. [Domesday Descendants p948]<br />

Sir Bartholomew de Burghersh (died August 3, 1355) was the son of Sir Robert de Burghersh (Lord Warden of the Cinque Ports 1299-1306) by Maud (nee de Badlesmere).<br />
 <br />
Bartholomew was born some time between 1287 and 1296. He succeeded his father as Lord Burghersh, upon the death of the first lord's eldest son, Bartholomew's brother, Stephen de Burghersh, in 1310. His other, younger brother was Henry de Burghersh (1292-1340), chancellor of England in 1328, and treasurer of England from 1334 to 1337.<br />
 <br />
Before June 11, 1320, he married Elizabeth, daughter of Sir Theobald de Verdun, Lord Verdun, (Justiciar of Ireland) by Maud de Mortimer.<br />
 <br />
Bartholomew de Burghersh served in the Scottish wars, and was with the Earl of Lancaster at the Battle of Boroughbridge (March 16, 1321/2), but was captured and taken as a prisoner. On August 25, 1346, he served Edward III at the Battle of Crecy both as a diplomat and a soldier, as did his son. Following this battle, many nobles were ransomed, and it is clear De Burghersh was at length released as he later served the king as a Constable of Dover Castle, and Lord Warden of the Cinque Ports, like his father before him. Bartholomew Burghersh (? - August 1351), brother of bishop Henry Burghersh became Baron Burghersh on the death of his brother Stephen in 1310.<br />
 <br />
He acted as assistant to Badlesmere until the execution of the latter; and then, trusted by Edward III, was constable of Dover Castle and warden of the Cinque Ports.<br />
 <br />
He acted as assistant to the first Lord Baron de Badlemere (b1274-5), his uncle, Lord Warden from 1320 until the execution of Badlesmere by the method of the time in 1322 when he was hanged, drawn & quartered (14th April) at Canterbury, in Kent; and having proven his trust to the king, was made constable of Dover Castle and Lord Warden of the Cinque Ports.<br />
 <br />
He served in this capacity in 1327 and 1343, and again between the years 1346-50. In addition to these duties he was also to serve as the Constable of the Tower of London beginning on the 27th of June 1355, a post he kept until his death.<br />
 <br />
Bartholomew de Burghersh was then Lord Warden of the Cinque Ports in the year of 1348, when:<br />
 <br />
"On 18th May by an inquisition taken by Bartholomew de Burghersh, Warden of the Cinque Ports, Parson Holbourne as rector of Rye was granted a place called Courton, where the pleus affecting the town are now held, adjoining the church yard and "of ancient time ordained there for a dwelling of the Parson of that church". Here was built the first Rectory House on the same site as it occupies today some 645 years later". (703 AD).<br />
 <br />
(Note: The Rector of Minster in Thanet from the 1430ʼs was William Holbourn, who was transferred to the living of the parish of Brooke as Rector of Woodnesborough, Canterbury during the 1470ʼs.)<br />
 <br />
Ref:<br />
Fragments of the History of The Old Vicarage, Rye. (poss. in google cashe?)<br />
 <br />
In 1340, Bartholomew became an heir to some lands held by one of his brothers, Henry de Burghersh, the Bishop of Lincoln and Lord Treasurer. Bartholomew de Burghersh was summoned to attend Parliament from the 25th of January, 1329 and served until the 15th of March in 1354: (25 years).<br />
 <br />
Bartholomew de Burghersh acted as a 'Banneret in 1341, and in the August of 1343, he formed part of an important embassy to the Pope' and later was to become Chamberlain of the royal Household.<br />
 <br />
His widow survived him by some five years. The son of Bartholomew de Burghersh by Elizabeth de Verdun, and third lord de Burghersh was also named Bartholomew. This Sir Bartholomew de Burghersh was one of the first 25 original Knights of the Garter, and 'earned a great reputation as a soldier, especially distinguishing himself at the Battle of Poitiers' (September 19, 1356). A companion of the Black Prince (Edward) in most of his expeditions he was one of the most renound soldiers of the period.<br />
 <br />
His daughter by Cecily de Weyland was named Elizabeth, and married Sir Edward le Despenser, KG (before December, 1364), the son of Sir Edward le Despenser by Anne de Ferrers. It was said that he died 'retaining to the last the royal confidence'.<br />

Herbert was evidently part of a conspiracy to overthrow Henry I in 1118 and was dismissed [from office of Chamberlain] and Suger of St Denis indicates that he was treated with mercy and was only castrated and blinded! [Richard Borthwick, post to SGM, 30 Jan 1998]<br />
 <br />
-----------------------------------------<br />
 <br />
This very ancient family from which the chivalrous house of Herbert and other eminent houses sprang, derived originally in England from Herbert, styled Count of Vermandois, who came over at the Conquest with the first William and filled the office of Chamberlain to William Rufus. He was great-grandson of Herbert, Comte de Vermandois, the lineal descendant of Charlemagne. Herbert is mentioned in the Battle Abbey Roll and was rewarded by a grant of lands in Hampshire. His wife was Emma, daughter of Stephen, Earl of Blois, by Adela, daughter of William the Conqueror, and by that lady left a son and heir, Herbert Fitz-Herbert.

Herbertus Regis Camerariius, the ancestor of all the Herberts, was Chamberlain in fee to Henry I, two of whose charters he attest at Windsor in 1101. There are only conjectures as to his lineage, of which in reality nothing whatever is known. He died "not long before 1130," and left, according to Eyton, three sons: 1. Herbert FitzHerbert; 2. Stephen FitzHerbert; and 3. William FitzHerbert, Archbishop of York in 1143, who was canonized by Pope Honorius III in the succeeding century. [Battle Abbey Roll II:61]<br />

Hunald (a.k.a. Hunold, or Hunaud), Duke of Aquitaine, succeeded his father Odo of Aquitaine (a.k.a. Eudes the Great) in 735.<br />
 <br />
He refused to recognize the high authority of the Frankish mayor of the palace, Charles Martel, whereupon Charles marched south of the Loire, seized Bordeaux and Blaye, but eventually allowed Hunald to retain Aquitaine on condition that he should promise fidelity.<br />
 <br />
From 736 to 741 the relations between Charles and Hunald seem to have remained amicable. But at Charles's death in 741 Hunald declared war against the Franks, crossed the Loire and burned Chartres. Menaced by Pippin and Carloman, Hunald begged for peace in 745 and retired to a monastery, probably on the Île de Ré.<br />
 <br />
We find him later in Italy, where he allied himself with the Lombards and was stoned to death. He had left the duchy of Aquitaine to Waifer of Aquitaine, who was probably his son, and who struggled for eight years in defending his independence against King Pippin.<br />
 <br />
At the death of Pippin and at the beginning of the reign of Charlemagne, there was a last rising of the Aquitanians. This revolt was directed by a certain Hunald, and was repressed in 768 by Charlemagne and his brother Carloman.<br />
 <br />
Hunald sought refuge with the duke of the Gascons, Lupus, who handed him over to his enemies. In spite of the opinion of certain historians, this Hunald seems to have been a different person from the old duke of Aquitaine.<br />

Despite the information about Isaac being Lovisa's brother, it is myopinion that he was her son.  The following is from the 'History of theSwedes of Clay County, South Dakota:<br />
Isace Sundling is believed to have been a brother of Mrs. John Eric Sundstrom, and the father of Charles Sundling of Vermillion who was a resident of Beresford for many years.  His birth date is unknown, but he came to the United States for Nobottens Län, Sweden, in 1870, and to Clay County in 1872, at the time Sundstrom came.  He filed on the southeast quarter, Sec. 2, of Glenwood Township, and obtained patent after final proof, May 24, 1879.  Isaac Sundling returned to Sweden after selling his land and there are no further records of him here.  He was single while here, but may have married after returning to Sweden.<br />

Odo of Aquitaine (a.k.a. Eudes the Great) (d. ca. 736), duke ofAquitaine, obtained this dignity about 715, and his territory includedthe southwestern part of Gaul from the Loire to the Pyrenees, with hiscapital in Toulouse.<br />
 <br />
In 718 he appears as the ally of Chilperic II, king of Neustria, who was fighting against the Austrasian mayor of the palace, Charles Martel; but after the defeat of Chilperic at Soissons in 719 he probably made peace with Charles by surrendering to him the Neustrian king and his treasures.<br />
 <br />
Odo was also obliged to fight the Saracens who invaded the southern part of his kingdom, and inflicted a severe defeat upon them at the Battle of Toulouse on June 9, 721. When, however, he was again attacked by Charles Martel, the Saracens renewed their ravages, and Odo was defeated near Bordeaux; he was compelled to crave protection from Charles, who took up this struggle and gained his momentous victory at Poitiers in 732. In 735 the king abdicated, and was succeeded by his son Hunald.<br />

In the ensuing negotiations, Charibert, a minor, was represented by his uncle Brodulf, the brother of Queen Sichilde. Dagobert had Brodulf killed and ceded the realm of Aquitaine to Charibert. This agreement was confirmed in 631, when Charibert stood godfather to Dagobert's son Sigebert.<br />
 <br />
Charibert's realm included Toulouse, Cahors, Agen, Perigueux and Saintes, to which he added to his possessions in Gascony. Charibert was married to Gisela, the heiress of Amand of Gascony. His fighting force subdued the resistance of the Basques, until the whole of the Basque territories was under his control.<br />
 <br />
In 632 Charibert died at Blaye, Gironde, possibly assassinated on Dagobert's orders, and soon after that Charibert's infant son Chilperic was also died. The Aquitaine passed again to Dagobert. Both of them are buried in the early Romanesque Basilica of Saint-Romain at Blaye.<br />
 <br />
Charibert's surviving son, Boggis, Duke of Aquitaine, (ca 626 - ca 688), was the father of Saint Hubertus, who resigned his worldly claims to his younger brother, who began a line of Merovingian dukes of Aquitaine that lasted until 778, when the last, Loup II, was killed by Charlemagne.<br />

Susan Hartenhoff-Haygood, a self-described Midwesterner, was born inSioux Falls, South Dakota. Her interest in art developed at an early agewith influence and support from her family and her father, a plein airepainter now living in California. She spent her childhood pondering thevast landscape that surrounded her. Her love of art is matched only byher passion for horses. She remembers learning about great artists as ayoung child. One of her most poignant early memories is of a piece called"The Horse Fair" by Rosa Bonheur, that hung in her elementary schoolʼshallway. It is this subject that first brought attention to her ownpaintings and drawings. Her love of horses was encouraged by her aunt,who helped her purchase her first horse and taught her horsemanship.<br />
She began her formal art education at South Dakota State University in Brookings, where she earned a Bachelor of Arts degree with an emphasis in printmaking. In her senior year she was honored with the Ritz-Caldwell-Young Art Scholarship. Her thirst for knowledge led her to the University of South Dakota in Vermillion where she worked towards her Master of Fine Art degree. Her talent was quickly noticed and she was awarded an apprenticeship at Echo Press, a fine art lithography press in Bloomington, Indiana. There she studied advanced lithographic techniques under the guidance of master printer David Keister and printmaker Rudy Pozzatti of Indiana University. When asked about creative influences, Susan cites printmaker Gerald Kruse. "He taught me the beauty of line and the importance of composition. But the most important thing he taught me was to create what I know and what I believe." While completing her education and in her career afterwards, she has participated in several solo exhibitions and won numerous awards. Her work can be found in private, civic, and corporate collections including the South Dakota Memorial Art Center, the Nobles County Art Center in Worthington, Minnesota, and in Donald Trumpʼs Taj Mahal in Atlantic City, New Jersey. Susan moved from the heartland of America to the center of the Western Desert in Phoenix, Arizona. "They donʼt ride horses to work, but there are bridle paths through the city, and back streets that lead to the nearby desert preserves. And the Arabian horse world revolves around Scottsdale. Itʼs been an inspiration to be so connected to nature and around such beautiful horses." Susanʼs primary source of inspiration is derived from the world of nature that surrounds her. It is natural that her work has taken on aspects of her newest influences. Susan now incorporates natural wood veneers and handmade papers into her work. Her love of the outdoors is evident in her color palette, a mix of warm neutrals with splashes of blues and greens. While she is constantly exploring new mediums, it is her affection for nature that is the driving force behind her work.<br />

She was the middle of fivechildren born to Harold Edwin, a rural family physician, and Ora LouiseKillam. Barkhouse attended the small rural school in Woodville untilgrade eleven when she transferred to the Kingʼs County Academy inKentville to complete grade twelve. In 1932, Barkhouse earned herTeacherʼs License from the Provincial Normal College in Truro and beganteaching in Sand Hill, Nova Scotia. In 1939, Barkhouse began teaching inLiverpool where she met Milton Joseph Barkhouse, a teller with the RoyalBank of Canada. They married in 1942 and had two children, Murray Roy,and Janet Louise. Miltonʼs position with the Royal Bank took them fromLiverpool to Halifax, Charlottetown, and eventually Montreal. JoyceBarkhouse returned to Nova Scotia in 1968 following her husbandʼs death.<br />
 <br />
Barkhouseʼs career as a writer began in 1932, when she was nineteen, with the publication of a short story in the Baptist church paper The Northern Messenger. Her subsequent articles and short stories, primarily written for a younger audience, have appeared in a number of church papers, anthologies, textbooks, and periodicals, while her column "For Mothers and Others" appeared in newspapers throughout Nova Scotia from 1973-1976. In 1974, at the age of sixty-one, Barkhouse published her first novel George Dawson: The Little Giant. She has now published a total of eight books, including Pit Pony which was adapted for television in 1997, and Annaʼs Pet, a childrenʼs book co-authored with niece Margaret Atwood, which was adapted for a puppet play by Mermaid Theatre.<br />
 <br />
Barkhouse and her work have received provincial and national recognition. In 1993, the Joyce Barkhouse Writing for Children Award was established by the Writersʼ Federation of Nova Scotia (WFNS). She received the Ann Connor Brimer Award from the Nova Scotia Library Association in 1991; the Valuable Contribution to Children's Literature Award from the Nova Scotia Children's Literature Roundtable in 1990; the Marianna Dempster Memorial Award from the Canadian Authors Association in 1989; the Cultural Life Award for outstanding service to the cultural life of Nova Scotia in 1982; and First prize, Children's Fiction from WFNS in 1979.<br />

Joyce Barkhouse, was born Joyce Killam on May 3, 1913, in Nova Scotia. The daughter of a "horse-and-buggy" doctor, Joyce attended a two-room village school in Woodville, Annapolis Valley and went on to study at the Teachers College in Truro.  Joyce's first teaching job was in the Annapolis Valley community of Sandhill (now called East Aylesford) and she taught all subjects in a one-room school comprised of grades one to eleven. Joyce taught full-time for eight years, until she married, and found that her strength was in teaching the early grades.<br />
Joyce came from a horse-loving family - horses in the Webster-Killam clan included Nellie, Goldie, Blackie, Molly, Mighty Maude, Lil Abner and Gem.  Her older sister Margaret (mother of author Margaret Atwood) was a keen horsewoman - she received riding tack, such as saddle and bridle, on her graduations.  Grandfather Webster was a great horse lover, and Joyce recalls how her grandfather was so furious when he encountered a man beating a horse that he jumped out of his wagon and purchased the abused animal on the spot.  He gave the horse, Blackie, to Margaret, and she nursed the poor broken animal back to glossy good health.  Another horse in the Webster-Killam family was Goldie.  She was caught in the Halifax Explosion of 1917.  Goldie belonged to Joyce's uncle Fred.  Fred's family home and flower nursery business were in the north end of Halifax, and his beloved horse lived in barn next to the house.  When the munitions ship Mont Blanc exploded, Fred's business was "blown to smithereens".  At the time, Fred was sick in bed and his wife Rose was temporarily trapped in the basement, but both survived.  Goldie, however, died in the fire. Nellie was the first horse ridden by Joyce.  Joyce had to deliver medicine to one of her father's patients, and during the ride she learned the lesson of the "loose girth" familiar to many novice riders.<br />
Following her marriage, Joyce lived in Halifax, Charlelottetown and Montreal, and eventually returned to Nova Scotia.  She now lives in the town of Bridgewater, and continues to spend summer days at her cherished Harbourville cottage overlooking the Bay of Fundy.<br />

Roger de Mortimer, deemed by some to have been son of William de Warren,and by others, of Walter de St. Martin, brother of that William, wasfounder of the abbey of St. Victor, in Normandy. "It is reported," saysDugdale, "that in the year 1054 (which was twelve years before the NormanConquest), when Odo, brother of Henry, King of France, invaded theterritory of Evreux, Duke William sent this Roger, then his general (withRobert, Earl of Ewe, and other stout soldiers), to resist his attempts;who meeting with Odo near to the castle of Mortimer, gave him battle, andobtained a glorious victory. It is further observable of this Roger thathe was by consanguinity allied to the Norman duke (afterwards king, bythe name of William the Conqueror), his mother being niece to Gunnora,wife of Richard, Duke of Normandy, great grandmother to the Conqueror."The presumed son of this Roger, Ralph de Mortimer, accompanying the Dukeof Normandy in his expedition against England, was one of his principalcommanders at the decisive battle of Hastings.

Seigneur of Mortemer-sur-Eauline, in Normandy. He was probably born before 990. He was the first to take the name Mortimer, which was taken from the village and castle of Mortemer-en-Brai (mortuum mare), in the Pays de Caux, sitmacted at the source of the little river Eaulne (Eauline). In 1054 he won the victory of Mortemer, fought under the walls of his castle, against the troops of Henry I, King of the French. He offended William and was deprived of his castle of Mortemer, which was transferred to his nephew William de Warenne. The Mortimers transferred their chief seat to Saint-Victor-en Caux, where the priory, a cell of Saint-Wuen of Rouen, was 1074 erected into abbey by Roger and his wife Hawise. [Ref: Tucker]<br />
 <br />
The family of Mortemer derives its name from Mortemer (Mortuo-Mari) in Pays-de-Caux at the source of the Eaulne River. The castle of St. Victor-en-Caux was the chief barony of the family, which is said to have sprung from a marriage of Walter de St. Martin and a niece of the Duchess Gonnor. It was possessed by Roger de Mortemer in 1054, on which date he was one of the commanders of Duke William's forces at the battle of Mortemer. He sheltered in his castle, after the battle, his father-in-law, Raoul III. the Great, Comte de Valois and d'Amiens, by Oderic Vital called de Montdidier, one of the French commanders, until he was able to conduct him safely to his own territories three days later. For this reason Roger was banished by Duke William and his estates confiscated. He was later pardoned and his possessions returned with the exception of the castle of Mortemer, which the Duke had given to Roger's brother, William de Warren I. He contributed sixty vassals to the fleet of Duke William and it is generally conceded that he was too old to have been present at Senlac, although he made a donation to the abbey of St. Ouen in 1074 and died prior to the compilation of the General Survey.

ROGER DE MORTEMER, Seigneur of Mortemer-sur-Eaulne in Normandy, was one of the leaders of the Norman forces at the battle of Mortemer in 1054, but having assisted the escape of one of the French prisoner, Ralph, Count of Montdidier, to whom he had done homage, he was exiled and his lands confiscated. He was afterwards reconciled to Duke William and some of his lands were restored to him, though not Moretmer, which had been given to his consanguineus William de Warrene; Saint-Victor-en-Caux thereupon became the caput of the Norman honour of the family. He is said to have founded the abbey of Saint-Victor-en-Caux. He was living in 1078 or later, but was dead in 1086, when his son Ralph appears in Domesday Book. He married Hawise.

Robert FitzHerbert, "the third lineal Chamberlain of his family,succeeded to the office and estate of his father, ere Henry II had beenthree months on the throne of England," and had d.s.p. before 1165. Hisheir was his brother Herbert, whose wife Lucia was a daughter, andeventually co-heiress of Milo de Gloucester, Earl of Hereford, Lord HighConstable of England. For some reason or other, that remains unexplained,this Herbert was out of favour with Henry II. "It is evident that he wasadmitted to far less than a full share of the inheritance which shouldhave come to him by his wife and mother; and there is some proof that atone period he was under total forfeiture. . . Before King Richard hadreigned a year he recovered part of his wife's inheritance, and later onthe moiety of Alcester." (Eyton) His sons were: 1. Reginald, who left nochildren; 2. Peter, his successor; and 3. Matthew, the reputed ancestorof Vincent FitzHerbert surnamed Le Finch of Netherfield in East Sussex,from whom the Earls of Winchilsea claim descent. But, according toEyton's pedigree, Matthew's grandson and last male representative,Matthew FitzJohn, who was summoned to parliament in 1296, died s.p. in1309-10. [Battle Abbey Rolls II:61-62]<br />

Herbert Fitz-Herbert obtained from Henry II a confirmation of the landed possessions of his father and, likewise, the office of chamberlain. In the 12th of that monarch, anno 1166, upon the assessment of the aid which was then levied for marrying the king's daughter, he certified that he held one knight's fee in Wilts and three in Berks. Upon the Conquest of Ireland, Henry II, at a great council held at Oxford anno 1177, gave the kingdom of Limerick in that Realme to this Herbert and William his brother, Reginald, Earl of Cornwall, and Josceline de la Pomerai, their nephew, (the City of Limerick and one cantred excepted, which the king reserved to himself and his heirs) to be held by the service of sixty knight's fees, but it appears they declined the gift. In the 6th of Richard I, he was sheriff of the county of Gloucester, for one of that year and afterwards during the whole reign of that king. In the eighth of the same reign, anno 1197, he was likewise sheriff of Shropshire.<br />
