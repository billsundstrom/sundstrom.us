TAHLEQUAH, Okla. -- Ruth Hoisington Myers of Tahlequah went to be with her Lord on Saturday, Dec. 8, 2007, at the age of 91. She had been a resident of Go Ye Village since 1989 and attended the First Evangelical Free Church in Tahlequah. <br>
Ruth was born Jan. 6, 1916, in her parents' farm house in Kishwaukee, Ill. She was the oldest of four children of Raymond E. and Lucinda Faye Steele Hoisington. <br>
Her elementary school days were spent in a one-room schoolhouse in Stillman Valley (near Kishwaukee). She attended high school in Rockford, Ill., where her father was a chemistry teacher. Following high school, she enrolled in Wheaton College in Wheaton, Ill., graduating in 1937. <br>
After graduating from college, Ruth worked as a librarian in Rockford for three years. She wed Burton H. Mayers on July 13, 1940. They lived in Chicago, and had four children before moving to Wheaton in 1951. A daughter, Nancy (age 8) preceded Ruth in death by polio in 1952 and one son, Bruce (age 30) died in 1976. During this time she was an active member of the Wheaton Bible Church and also worked for 15 years at the Wheaton College Post Office. <br>
She and Burt retired to Bella Vista in 1975. While there they continued to enjoy travel in their motor home, gardening, sewing, reading, Bible teaching and community activities. She especially enjoyed her trips to Israel, Alaska, and visits with her children and grandchildren. <br>
In 1989, they moved to Go Ye Village, Tahlequah. In December of that year, she suddenly lost her husband of 49 years. Ruth 's long term interest in missionary work prompted her in April of 1996 to become involved in the Ukraine Project. She worked tirelessly to obtain warm clothing for those in need in the Ukraine. The Slavic Gospel Mission recognized her for her hard work on this project. <br>
She continued to live in the Patio home area until 1997, when health concerns made it necessary to move into assisted living where she spent the remainder of her life. Her family remembers her as a very caring and loving wife, mother, grandmother and great-grandmother who always kept her family in her thoughts and prayers. <br>
Ruth was preceded in death by her beloved husband of 49 years, Burton, her mother, Lucinda Faye Hoisington, father, Raymond E. Hoisington, sister, Betty Anderson, son, Bruce Burton Myers and daughter, Nancy Beth Myers . <br>
She is survived by loving children, daughter, Judith Ruth Myers Bergquist and husband Robert of Bedford, N.H., and son, Stephen Paul Myers and wife Susan VanKoevering Myers of West Olive, Mich.; three grandchildren, James Bergquist and wife Ingrid Brommers Bergquist of Wellesley, Mass., Anne Bergquist Koellmer and husband Scott of Bedford and Peter Bergquist and wife Paula Wright of Sebastopol, Calif.; six great-grandchildren, Joshua and Morgan Koellmer, Harper and Ellis Brommers Bergquist and Lakemoon and Temple Wright Bargquist. <br>
Also surviving are brother, Raymond Hoisington and wife Roberta of Cedar Lake, Ind., and sister, Kathryn Hoisington Wernberg and husband William Wernberg of Rockford, Ill., along with numerous beloved nieces, nephews, cousins and friends. <br>
A private interment will be held at Benton County Memorial Park in Rogers. A memorial service will be held at 2 p.m. Wednesday at Go Ye Village Chapel in Tahlequah. <br>
Memorials may be made in honor of Ruth to Go Ye Village Golden Years Assistance Society. <br>
Arrangements are by Callison-Lough Funeral Home in Rogers.<br>

Susan HOISINGTON
<p>
<a name ="I080184"><b>[I080184]</b></a><br />
I have listed Susan as the 1st wife of Hiram Cook, because Martha Hoisington was living with them 1850.  Hiram married Martha in 1851, I assume after Susan died.  However, the 1850 census lists Susan as born in 1830.  Also other sources state that Susan Hoisington was born in 1818 and dies in 1845.  <br>
