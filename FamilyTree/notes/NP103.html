TRAVERSE CITY - Jack Harrison Cox, age 85, passed away on Jan. 31, 2010, after a brief stay at The Pavilions in Traverse City. <br>
Jack was born on Oct. 5, 1924, to Henry and Nora Cox on the Cox farm in Williamsburg. Jack had an older brother, McKenzie and a younger sister, Joan Walters. <br>
He married Marion Ruth Shepard on Oct. 11, 1947, in Detroit, at the All Saints Episcopal Church. They made their home in Traverse City because there was no other place either wanted to be. Together they built three homes, with Jack as the self-taught carpenter, plumber and electrician. Marion was the decorator, and they made a great team.<br>
As a proud Central High School Trojan, Jack participated in football, basketball and track. He enjoyed lifelong activities including golf, swimming, sailing, skiing and snowmobiling, and spent many wonderful hours fishing with his best buddies, his father, Henry and his brother, Mac. He loved the outdoors, which was his inspiration for living.<br>
Jack served his country in the Navy from 1943 to 1958, even leaving high school early to enlist. He served on a naval destroyer during World War II and continued in the Naval Reserves as a Motor Machinist Mate until he was honorably discharged. <br>
He was a member of the Elks Lodge, the First Congregational Church and the American Legion. <br>
He and his brother, McKenzie operated Cox Brothers Service Station, where they launched the Hertz Car Rental Agency for several years at the corner of Front and Park streets. Jack then joined Consumers Power Company and enjoyed a long career as a repairman, retiring as a supervisor for repair crews in Northern Michigan.<br>
Surviving are Jack's wife of 62 years, Marion; and daughters, Jacque (Ed) Schmitt, Carole (Bill) Dwyer and Bev (Mike) Gore. He was very proud of all his grandchildren, Chris (Jacqui) McGrew, Doug (Tonya) McGrew, Zach (Anne) Gore, Danielle Gore, Erin (Nate) Atterberry, Alex Gore, Megan (Lars) Kelto, Adam (Erica) Dwyer and James Dwyer. Also of great joy were five great-grandchildren, (Chris and Jacqui) Kayla, Jack Henry and Cameron McGrew and (Doug and Tonya) Morgan and Nora McGrew. He is also survived by his sister, Joan Walters and her children, Barbara (Rick) Anderson, Jim (Kim) Walters and Bob (Terra) Walters; sister-in-law, Victoria Cox and her son, David (Amy); brother-in-law, Albert Hyde; niece, Lyndon; and nephew, Roger (Kathy) Hardy.<br>
In their retirement, Jack and Marion traveled to New England and south in the winters but the best times were summers on their beach on East Bay with their family and friends, because for Jack there truly was "no place like home."<br>
The service will be held at 3 p.m. on Saturday, Feb. 6, at First Congregational Church, 6105 Center Road, Traverse City. <br>

Gertrude Doolittle COXE
<p>
<a name ="I068958"><b>[I068958]</b></a><br />
John Trumbull Robinson, son of Henry C. and Eliza Trumbull Robinson, was born April 25th, 1871, and died November 27th, 1937. He was graduated from the Hartford Public High School in 1889 and from Yale University in 1893; studied law in his father's office and was admitted to the Connecticut bar in 1896. His whole life was spent in Hartford and it was filled with professional work, civic activities, and a variety of social interests, all of which by nature he entered into with zest and enjoyment.<br>
<br>
He was chairman of the Republican town committee from 1903 to 1906; executive secretary to Governor George P. McLean from 1901 to 1903; a delegate to the Republican national convention in 1904; from 1908 to 1912 he was United States attorney for the District of Connecticut; and was president of the Hartford County Bar Association from 1930 to 1932. Higher political honors he undoubtedly might have had if he had been willing and able to make the sacrifice of time and energy which political life in his day demanded. All through his life he was an adviser in the councils of the Republican party and a staunch upholder of constitutional government.<br>
<br>
Few young men have begun the practice of law in Hartford with the inspiration of such a family tradition as had Mr. Robinson. His father, who died in 1900, was a leader of the Connecticut bar and an uncle, Lucius F. Robinson, was a brilliant lawyer and scholar. At the time of his admission to the bar his father and his oldest brother, Lucius F. Robinson, were in partnership under the firm name of Robinson and Robinson, and after his father's death he and his brother Lucius F. Robinson continued the firm under the same name until January 1st, 1913, when Francis W. Cole became a member and the name of the firm was changed to Robinson, Robinson and Cole.<br>
His career at the bar was long, happy and successful. He had the opportunity of early activity in the trial of cases and to this branch of the law he turned by natural inclination. At the same time he was a most conscientious and sound adviser. One often attempts to ascertain the source of one's professional success. There was no sham in Mr. Robinson's nature and it always seemed to me that his frankness in admitting every adverse feature of his case and his boldness in driving home his argument, with all the facts before the court, made for the success he attained. He once said to me that any judge or jury was quick to detect any attempt at unfairness. During his busy life he had tried many important cases and frequently was called upon by other lawyers for help. One lawyer, in a public address, used these words: "His Grecian head, his tall and graceful figure, his ringing voice. and his flow of natural eloquence made him a forceful advocate." He fulfilled the true function of an advocate - fidelity to his client and to the court as well - with the result that he won the confidence of both.<br>
One of his outstanding characteristics was his fondness for out-of door life. He loved the woods, fields and streams. He was a devoted follower of Isaac Walton and the happiest days of his life were those when he could indulge in the gentle art of angling.<br>
His religion was a vital part of his life. He was a devout follower of the Master, and a loyal member of his church.<br>
Manly and handsome, with a sound mind in a sound body, given a personality full of charm and sentiment, he was a friend among many friends and a true Christian gentleman.<br>
On April 25th, 1905, he married Gertrude Doolittle Coxe of Utica, New York, who, together with two children, Mrs. John Pierson of New Haven and John T. Robinson, Jr., of Hartford, survive him.<br>

He graduated from Heppner High School in 1947 and enrolled in photography school in Portland. <br>
In 1948 he enlisted in the Air Force. He served in the 3200th Photographic and Measurements and Data Reduction Squadron at Eglin Field in Florida.

Glenn married his high school sweetheart, Maylis Johnson on June 10, 1951.<br>

While stationed in Florida Glenn developed a desire to own a sailboat. In 1958 he built an 18' powerboat which he used for fishing across the Columbia River Bar and discovered his love of the San Juan Islands. A 30' Arthur Piver design trimaran sailboat was built in 1964. Many family trips were made on the Columbia River and summers sailing in the San Juan Islands. In 1974 Glenn began building a Bruce Roberts 44' ketch in his back yard in Salem, Oregon. Glenn worked every evening and weekends for 8 years, launching the Mariah in 1982.<br>
After retiring Glenn and Maylis moved aboard and sailed to La Paz where they spent 4 years. They returned to the Northwest and sailed the waters for another 6 years. Glenn also sailed with friends to Trinidad and Belize. Mariah was sold in 1996.<br>
Glenn loved adventure. In 1988 Glenn and Maylis bicycled and camped in Sweden, Finland, Denmark, England, Scotland, and The Netherlands. They rode 1800 miles over a 3  month period. In 1997 they bicycled and camped in France for 7 weeks.<br>
Glenn and Maylis settled in Port Hadlock in 2003, close to the ocean Glenn so loved. <br>

Contributions can be made to the National Parkinson Foundation.<br>
