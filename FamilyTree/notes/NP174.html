<h2>Notes</h2>
Bettye Jean FEHD
<p>
<a name ="I013155"><b>[I013155]</b></a><br />
 Wheeler  was a dedicated volunteer<br>
REDLANDS - Bettye Wheeler dedicated her life to helping people, as a nurse and as a volunteer in many Redlands organizations.<br>
She served as president of the board of Redlands Meals on Wheels and president of Redlands United Church of Christ, and she was not only a leader but a listener, according to those who worked with her.<br>
"Whenever you were talking with Bettye, she was 100 percent present, totally connected to you, taking you into her heart and reflecting herself back," said Loring Fiske-Phillips, current president of Redlands United Church of Christ. "She would always do what I term 'whole-face listening,"' he said. "Bettye was a very dynamic person," said Kathy Van Meter, a coordinator with Redlands Meals on Wheels. "We're going to miss her terribly."<br>
Wheeler died April 28 at Redlands Community Hospital, after an illness. She was 72.<br>
She first came to Redlands in 1970 when her husband, Charlie, was serving in the U.S. Air Force. They lived here until 1974, then came back in 1986.<br>
"Redlands kind of captured us," her husband said. Near the end of his Air Force career, he asked for an assignment here so they could settle in Redlands where they had made many friends and were involved in the community.<br>
Bettye Wheeler had been active with Redlands Meals on Wheels in the 1970s, and when she returned in the '80s she was soon rolling again with the organization that delivers meals to homebound people.<br>
In addition to serving as president of the board of Redlands Meals on Wheels, she had been a chairman and on the admissions committee and, of course, she delivered meals, both on a regular route and as a substitute.<br>
"She contributed a great deal to our program," Van Meter said. "She was dedicated to offering whatever help she could."<br>
Bev Woolverton, another Meals on Wheels volunteer, said Wheeler was "a great lady and a good cook, too."<br>
"She made wonderful chocolate chip cookies," Woolverton said. "She did everything with Meals on Wheels. I'm going to miss her."<br>
Bettye Jean Wheeler was born May 6, 1935, in Boonville, Ind., and received her diploma as a registered nurse at Deaconess Hospital in Evansville, Ind.<br>
Shortly after that she married and began more than 30 years as an Air Force wife. During that time she used her nursing skills as a Red Cross volunteer and registered nurse in many places.<br>
After earning her bachelor's degree in nursing from the University of Utah, she worked as a public health nurse in Hawaii and for 12 years in Riverside County before retiring.<br>
She was active in Air Force wives' clubs and church activities throughout her life.<br>
In Redlands, she was a member of Redlands United Church of Christ and served as president of the church from 1997 to 1999. She also served as a parish nurse for the church and represented Redlands United Church of Christ on the Redlands Area Interfaith Council.<br>
Some of the young people in the church called her "the youngest spirit in an old body they have ever known," according to Fiske-Phillips.<br>
He recalled that a week before she died, she wanted to be part of a small group meeting so much that she had the meeting at her house. "She 'held court,' " he said, "with the committee sitting around, soaking in her love and wisdom. You could tell she was completely in the group and outside her own health issues."<br>
At another meeting, Fiske-Phillips said, when the church board's discussion turned to finances and the fact that there often wasn't enough money to go around, she said her life's philosophy was to have as much fun as possible on the least amount of money.<br>
Fiske-Phillips said part of the church's message is: No matter who you are or where you are on life's journey, you're welcome here.<br>
"Bettye lived that message and projected that sentiment to everyone she met," he said.<br>
She was also active in the Redlands Symphony Guild.<br>
In a letter to the editor printed in today's Daily Facts, Walter Collins, former executive director of the Redlands Symphony Orchestra, wrote: "Bettye leaves a tremendous legacy of selfless wisdom and caring volunteerism, and I will cherish her memory dearly. The finer things of Our Town remain as a testament to Bettye and her indomitable spirit."<br>
Other community involvement included Redlands Family Service Association and the Wee Care child-care center at Orangewood High School, where she did child development assessment.<br>
She was a member of the PEO sisterhood, and her hobbies included cooking, sewing, reading and traveling.<br>
Survivors include her husband of 51 years, Charles Wheeler; her sons Scott Wheeler and wife Candace of Springfield, Va., and Brian Wheeler and wife Stephanie of Fairfield, Calif.; her daughters Jean Dziedzinski of Chelmsford, Mass., and Nancy Thomas and husband Paul of Loma Linda; her brother Dale Fehd and wife Michelle of Smithfield, Va.; and grandchildren Jennifer Tebbe, Jennifer Dziedzinski, Richard Dziedzinski, Katherine Thomas, Jonathan Thomas, CJ Mroz, Rachel Wheeler, Jessica Wheeler, Benjamin Wheeler, David Wheeler, Nicolaus Thomas and Cameron Wheeler.<br>
A memorial service to celebrate her life will be held at 2 p.m. Saturday, May 3, at Redlands United Church of Christ, 168 Bellevue Ave., Redlands, with the Rev. Sharon R. Graff officiating.<br>
At her request, those attending the service are asked not to wear black; aloha wear is appropriate.<br>
Graveside services will be private, at Riverside National Cemetery.<br>
