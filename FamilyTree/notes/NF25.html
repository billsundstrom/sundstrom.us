The Merriman Wedding<br>
Love never gives up. It's always hopeful. Love endures all things. That's a verse commonly heard at weddings. And it takes on a whole new meaning for one Sioux Falls couple.<br>
We first told you about Tristen Larson on Thursday night's Eye on KELOLAND. She's 25 years-old and is fighting her way through Hodgkins Lymphoma. This is the fourth time she's had to battle the cancer. But from now on she won't have to fight it alone.<br>
Music is what first brought them together... and today the music guided the ceremony.<br>
Bridesmaid Dawn Gardner says, "They both have an extreme love for music. So music is definitely a pivotal part of their relationship."<br>
The bond goes far beyond the music. When Tristen found out in January that her cancer had returned, Jake wouldn't let her fight it alone. No matter how hard she tried to push him away, he'd pushed even harder to stay together. And, it worked.<br>
Groom Jake Merriman says, "Ever since I fell in love with you I have felt unworthy of you. I see more and more clearly now the man I want to be and see that I am not yet that man. I'm more willing than ever to become that man."<br>
Bride Tristen Merriman says, "I didn't realize that I would meet someone who exceeded my list."<br>
Friend Dave Colley says, "It's amazing that she's given such a gift as a man like Jake to be able to be with her and to be able to share her life with her."<br>
And today is a new beginning for two people who've already been through so much.<br>
Tristen's mother Marlys Larson says, "It's been a real emotional rollercoaster over the last few years. But today I'm just celebrating with them both. Love 'em both. It's been a wonderful day and now we still have more to come."<br>
The next step is their honeymoon. The Merrimans will be spending it at a resort in Minnesota. They leave sometime next week.<br>
