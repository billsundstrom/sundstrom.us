Obituary Notice -<br>
In the very melancholy and sad death of Mrs. Edward Craig, whose demise we record today, we have a painful illustration of the uncertainty of human life, as she was only taken ill on Thursday evening last, with convulsions, and remained unconscious up to the hour of death which occurred on Sunday morning. The deceased was the youngest daughter of the late John A. Morse, of this town, and was in the 43rd year of her age. Every effort was made to save her life, not only by our local physician, but also by a brother, Dr. John Morse, now practising at Ohio, Yarmouth Co., who arrived on Saturday. Mrs. Craig took an active part in the W.C.T.U. Society, was a consistent member of the Baptist Church, and is mourned by a sorrowing mother, husband, and many other relatives, who have the assurance that she led a Christian life, to soothe them in their deep affliction. The last sad rites took place yesterday afternoon, the remains being taken from the home to the Baptist Church, where feeling and appropriate remarks were made by the Rev. F.M. Young, assisted by the Rev. F.H. Wright and the Rev. John Cameron, after which they were conveyed to their resting place in the family burying-gound, followed by a large number of mourners.<br>

------------------------------------<br>
CONSPICUOUS among the founders of the town of Dedham, Massachusetts, was Samuel Morse, who came from England in 1635, and soon afterward Christopher Grant became one of the first settlers of Watertown, Massachusetts. Then- descendants lived in that colony and State, intermarrying with the families of Adams of Braintree, Cheever of Boston, Coolidge, Eustis, Mellidge, Rea, Watson, and others. In the seventh generation from the one was born Adolphus Morse, and in the same generation from the other was born Mary E. Grant. These two married, uniting not only the family names, but the distinctive hues of character that had marked the two families for centuries. In 1850 they removed from Massachusetts and established a new home at Rochester, New York, where was born to them, on March 13, 1859, a son. <br>
Such was the origin of Waldo Grant Morse. He was educated in the schools of Rochester, and in Rochester University, but was compelled to leave the latter institution before graduation on account of impaired health. Two years of rest and travel followed, and then he took up the study of law in the Rochester office of Martindale & Oliver. He was admitted to the bar in 1884, and began the practice of his profession in his native city, in a new office of his own, and without a partner. The venture was eminently successful. At the end of four years the young man's standing in the legal world of Rochester was well secured. Then his ambition led him to seek a place in a larger world. <br>
Seneca Falls, Sept. 17 - Word was received here yesterday of the death in a hospital at Kingston of Waldo G. Morse, 75, attorney of New York, and president and a director of the State Bank of Seneca Falls. <br>
Mr. Morse was stricken with a heart attack in Kingston while enroute by automobile from Seneca Falls to New York and taken to the hospital but failed to rally. Born in Rochester, Mr. Morse was educated In the schools of that city and graduated from the University of Rochester. He maintained law offices in New York for many years and had residences at 47 Cayuga street in Seneca Palls and in Yonkers. His wife, Mrs. Adelaide Cook Morse, a native of Seneca Palls, died in February, last year. <br>
Mr. Morse became president of the State Bank of Seneca Falls following the death of Thomas Pallard in 1932.  He was an attorney for the Grange League Federation and for the American Agriculturist. Several thousand acres of land in the Montezuma marshes northeast of here were owned by Mr. Morse. <br>

Geneva Daily Times Monday, September 17, 1934<br>
---------------------------------------------<br>
Mr. Morse accordingly came to New York and entered upon the practice of the law here. At the beginning of his metropolitan career he established the firm of Morse & Haynes. It prospered so greatly that it was found desirable to increase its force by the addition of another partner, and the style was changed to Morse, Haynes & Wensley, and thus remained until the firm was dissolved on the death of Mr. Haynes. <br>
Lawyers, as well as other professional men, often run to special- ties in their practice. Such has been the case with Mr. Morse. He has had from the outset a considerable practice in all branches of law, and is accomplished and successful therein; but his chief attention has been given and his chief successes won in corporation and constitutional law. To these his practice has largely turned, and upon them he is a recognized authority. Out- side of his strictly professional labors, Mr. Morse has long given to questions of political and social economy study and research. He has also been interested in much legislation for the welfare of the State. Thus he drafted and secured the passage, in 1895, of the bill for the appointment of commissioners to consider the question of saving the Palisades from defacement and destruction. He also drew up the Palisades National Reservation bills passed in 1896 by the Legislatures of New York and New Jersey, and finally drafted an act for Congress on the same subject. Upon the passage of the legislative act he was appointed by the Governor of New York to be one of three Palisades Commissioners, to act jointly with similar commissioners to be appointed by the Governor of New Jersey, and of the whole joint commission he was chosen secretary and treasurer. This commission made an elaborate report to the Governors of the two States concerned on December 5, 1895. Mr. Morse has also written much in the press on the subject of the preservation of the Palisades, has argued the cause before various committees of Congress, and on request has addressed various business and social organizations on the same subject. <br>
As a public orator Mr. Morse has won frequent praise, his address at the unveiling of the soldiers' monument at Seneca Falls, New York, in 1889, and that on a like occasion at Water- town, New York, in 1890, being especially remembered with much pleasure. A part of the Watertown address may well be quoted: <br>
"Year by year the stillness of peace has mantled fields of tumult. Time has stolen on unheeded, and today the past is with us only as in a dream. Company after company, regiment after regiment, come in memory - men who counted not life too precious nor years too long for the service of their country. Holy their cause and magnificent their achievement. Ages shall know their story and all men share the blessings of their legacy of good. So we have met, and so we bear this shaft, that it may witness how well men loved the right; how gallantly they fought ; how patiently they suffered, not for gain or conquest, not for home or companions, not for themselves or their race - for their country and simple right and justice. Upon us, in another generation, rests the great stewardship of destiny. Ours to preserve inviolate and unshaken in their strength those great truths and principles upon which are built our state and that eternal righteousness of justice in which its foundations rest. And here once more we pledge full faith to our beloved land ! Strong and free in all her wealth of vast domain and virgin soil, the crown of destiny is on her brow, bright as a star radiant in deepest night. Ring through the world the watchwords of her greatness ; Justice to all ! Oppression for none ! To no man a privilege by law ! To every man his freedom and his right, untrammeled and complete ! " <br>
Mr. Morse is president of the Incorporated Morse Society, and a member of the American Academy of Political and Social Science, the American, New York State, and New York City Bar associations, the Society of Colonial Wars, the Sons of the Revolution, the Lawyers' Club, the Quill Club, the Reform Club, and various other organizations both in and out of town. He was married, at Seneca Falls, New York, in 1886, to Miss Adelaide P. Cook, daughter of Albert Cook and Caroline Partridge Cook, the latter a daughter of Erastus Partridge. <br>
