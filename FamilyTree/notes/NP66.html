The flags are at half-mast today at the University of California, Los Angeles, where our son, Fred, was recently advanced to the newly created position of Assistant Research Professor of Surgery/ Urology.<br>
The light was turned out on his desk where he would prepare no more brilliant medical papers. Forty years and a day seem all too short a life. However, as his colleague of a dozen years, Dr. Bruce Belt, said in tribute" "Fred was a skillful surgeon, a dedicated worker, a careful student. His research was creative and original. His discovery of a way to grow bits of human cancer in hamsters may enable us to test the ability of a wide taint! of drugs to destroy a particular cancer from a particular patient. This is his immortal progeny for the benefit of all men. He was loved with faith, with loyalty, with a beautiful love."<br>
Ulla, Eleanor and I are proud that his colleagues are establishing a Frederick Bedell Burt Medical Foundation to carry on his work. Contributions are being accepted by Dean Sherman M. Mellinkoff, School of Medicine, University of California, Los Angeles.<br>
