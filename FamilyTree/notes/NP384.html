<p>
<a name ="I018922"><b>[I018922]</b></a><br />
Adolph Frank Muehler was born on August 10, 1916 in rural Hankinson, North Dakota to Wilhelm & Bertha (Ziegelman) Muehler. Adolph was baptized by Rev. J.P. Klausler at Immanuel Lutheran Church at Hankinson, North Dakota and confirmed April 13, 1936. He attended rural school in Greendale Township in North Dakota. Adolph married Ramona Dorgeloos on December 1, 1950 by Rev. David Kuecht at Cornelke Methodist Church at Fairmount, North Dakota. They lived and farmed in the Hankinson area until 1956 when they bought a farm in West Taylor Township, rural Wheaton, Minnesota where they continued to live today. Three children were born to them: Jeff, Tami & Lona. Adolph farmed all of his working years along with livestock trucking 1948-1956. Also while farming he worked at Rosers Turkey Farm and J & J Poultry. Adolph worked for Carlson Implement in Wheaton from 1958-1959. He was a salesman for Madison Silo Company. He also did some custom combining. He retired from farming in 1981. He drove the beet truck for 14 years and also helped neighbors with the field work up to most recent years. Adolph raised beef Herefords and milked dairy cows for many years. The children spent many hours with their dad in the barn while he was milking cows, they had to make name tags to put above the cow's pen. Adolph belonged to the Rosholt Senior Citizens for many years and thoroughly enjoyed playing cards with all of his friends. He was financial secretary for St. Paul's Lutheran Church and was secretary/treasurer for the West Taylor Township. He was very involved with his children's activities and was an Adult 4-H Leader for the local Bois de Sioux 4-H Club and for the Traverse County 4-H. Adolph had many hobbies and interest. He loved to go pheasant hunting and deer hunting which he did every year. Every year he brought his son, son-in-laws and grandsons hunting (where they learned from the best). He thoroughly enjoyed fishing and taught Jeff, Tami & Lona how to fish for bullheads. He spent a lot of his time taking the fish off the hooks and getting the fishing line out of the trees for us, but he loved it as much as we did and he was always smiling. Adolph loved sports, especially the Minnesota Twins baseball. He very rarely missed a game on the radio or TV, as he did with football. He knew every player, their stats, their team, etc. He also spent years playing softball which he loved and bowled for many years. And oh, how he loved to dance. When Adolph and Ramona took to the dance floor a lot of people would stop and watch. They danced so well together. Adolph loved to travel and take family trips. Before his eyesight left him he also loved to read. He enjoyed nature books and reading the daily paper. He enjoyed playing cards, especially UNO with his grandchildren and family. Adolph could be heard saying their was never any one he did not like. He totally enjoyed each and every day. He enjoyed building beautiful nativity stables and made one for his three children to treasure forever. Adolph never forgot a birthday, anniversary or holiday. He always bought special cards for his wife Ramona. When his eyesight failed he wanted his children to read some cards to him and he could pick it out. This was always very important to him. Adolph was the youngest of 12 children. He had 6 sisters and 5 brothers. The sisters were, Annie, Bertha & Ella Muehler, Amanda Buck, Mary Sander, and Emma Medenwaldt. His brothers were John, Albert, Henry, Gustave, and William Muehler.
