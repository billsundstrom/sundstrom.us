Clodien ap GWRYDR
<p>
<a name ="I009805"><b>[I009805]</b></a><br />
The ancestry is a little confused at this point. Apparently 'Ancestors of Evelyn Wood Keeler', indicated below agrees with the way I have it, with Clodien marrying Morfydd verch Owain. but the 'Annals & Antiquities of Wales' has Morfydd, born about the same time, marrying Clodien's father, Gwrydr, and was thus not Gwaithfoed's mother, but his grandmother. Since the latter would make Gwaithfoed born much later, this scheme goes hand-in-hand with Gwaithfoed living more contemporaneously with Harold than with Edgar of England. (see notes under Gwaithfoed). I have tried to muddle through supporting both an early and late Gwaithfoed, so I am leaving Morfydd as married to Clodien.<br>
