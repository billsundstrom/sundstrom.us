MRS. B.W. SKINNER<br>
MAHONE BAY, Jan. 12 - The community was shocked today to learn of the sudden passing of one of its most esteemed residents, Mrs. B.W. Skinner, 53, wife of Dr. B.W. Skinner, resident physician. Mrs. Skinner had been in failing health for some time but her death early last evening came as a surprise to friends far and near.<br>
Mrs. Skinner was born at Cambridge, Kings County, and was the daughter of Mrs. Minnie Knowlton and the late E.W. Knowlton, Cambridge. A graduate of the Provincial Normal School, she taught at Bear river, Digby, Parrsboro, and Canning schools before her marriage in 1920 to Dr. B.W. Skinner, a graduate of McGill, who was practicing at Hubbards following his return from overseas where he had served with the Hospital Corps in Mesopotamia.<br>
The deceased was an active supporter of the various social and welfare organizations of the community. She was a member of the United Baptist Church and served for many years as a member of the choir and Women's Missionary Society.<br>
She is survived by her husband, Dr. Skinner and daughter, Betty. Also surviving are her mother, Mrs. Minnie Knowlton; two brothers, J.P. Knowlton, Kentville, and F.D. Knowlton, Standard, Alberta; and one sister, Mrs. Charles Compton, Winnipeg, Manitoba.<br>
Funeral arrangements have not yet been completed but a service will be held at Mahone Bay and Cambridge where interment will take place.<br>
The sincere sympathy of the community is extended to the bereaved family.<br>

Gwynneth Joyce (Knowlton) Wallace was born in Calgary in 1929, to Ted and Faye Knowlton. She grew up in Standard, Alta, attended Mount Royal College in Calgary and received a degree in Nursing from UBC, Vancouver. Her graduation day was the day of her wedding rehearsal and the following day she married Robert Wallace, a theological student from Armstrong BC. Together they served United churches in Abbey Saskatchewan, Lake Cowichan BC, Calgary, Montreal and Toronto and after retiring to Nova Scotia, a number of congregations in the Annapolis Valley. They raised five children, Dolly Lansdowne, Bella Bella BC, Brenda Wallace-Allen, Blomidon, Craig, Edmonton, Scott (TJ Scott), and Mark, Los Angeles. Gwynneth became a vital presence in the lives of her children's partners, her much loved grandchildren and her adored great grandchildren. She also had an enduring impact on extended family, "almost family" and a worldwide circle of friends. Gwynneth was an innovator and leader in Public Health throughout her career, at one point representing WHO as an intercontinental traveling planner in Heart Health. She was a recognized leader in every community in which she resided always seeking out opportunities to cultivate an interest in the arts, most recently founding the popular Grow with Art program at NSCC Kingstec. Gwynneth was a great observer of life which she documented through photos and journaling. This observation of detail is reflected in a number of books she wrote or co-wrote. She lived with cancer for 30 years before finally quietly "slipping the surly bonds of earth" June 28th at home in the presence of family. We will gather to remember her as a mentor, host, educator, advisor, leader and nurturer of dreams at a memorial service to be held on July 21st at 2:00 at St. Andrew's United Church, Wolfville. Gwynneth would have appreciated donations to the Valley Hospice Foundation or Grow with Art. Arrangements have been entrusted to the White Family Funeral Home and Cremation Services, Kentville.<br>
