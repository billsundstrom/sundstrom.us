Robert Wright BROOKS
<p>
<a name ="I094422"><b>[I094422]</b></a><br />
As physician Robert W. Brooks lay dying in Mercy General Hospital, so many friends and former patients showed up that doctors banned visitors. <br>
"Is there anybody your husband didn't know?" one of the attending physicians finally asked his wife, Janet Brooks . <br>
The 80-year-old obstetrician-gynecologist died Sunday of complications after a stroke. <br>
During four decades of practicing medicine in Sacramento, he delivered more than 5,000 babies and treated thousands of women. <br>
When Dr. Brooks , who in later years specialized in fertility problems, retired from active practice, he still had 3,800 current patients, said his wife, who also managed his office. <br>
He was known for, among other things, the hugs he gave to virtually all his patients. <br>
"It was part of our practice. They expected, and received, hugs at the end of every visit," his wife recalled. <br>
"He had this great bedside manner," said Judy Kenourgios, a former patient. "I went to him because my mother went to him and my sister went to him. And we all got used to those hugs. Absolutely. He was also someone you could talk to. You felt he always listened." <br>
Within a few months of his formal retirement in 1994, Dr. Brooks was back at work practicing medicine, this time at walk-in medical clinics. <br>
"We both got restless," his wife explained. "Neither one of us were homebodies." <br>
Until a few months ago, he was working at the Sutter County out-patient clinic in Yuba City and the Prime Medical Group in Jackson. <br>
"Until he became ill, he was really sharp, totally up on everything," said Dr. Severon Buechel, a longtime friend and colleague. <br>
At various times in the past few years, Dr. Brooks also worked part time at MD Care in Roseville, Rapid Care in Cameron Park, Health for All in Sacramento and Consolidated Tribal Health in Ukiah. <br>
"He had to work as a doctor. That was his essence, his self-identity," said his son J. Travis Brooks of Glen Cove, N.Y. <br>
A native of Racine, Wis., he was the son of Ethel Bates Brooks and Laverne Brooks . He was reared in Wichita, Kan., and earned his medical degree in 1943 from the University of Kansas Medical School. He served as a Navy shipboard medical officer in the Pacific. <br>
He did his residency at the University of Oregon hospital in Portland. He also studied theology at Church Divinity School of the Pacific in Berkeley. He was active in St. Michael's Episcopal Church in Carmichael. <br>
In Sacramento, he was a staff member at Sutter Memorial, American River, Mercy San Juan, Mercy General Hospital and UC Davis Medical Center. <br>
His first wife, the former Ella Jean Hedrick, preceded him in death. <br>
In addition to his wife, Janet, and son Travis, survivors include sons R.C. Brooks of Poway and Robert W. Brooks II of Sacramento; daughters Jeannie Steindorf of Redwood Shores and Mindy Norlie of Chico; stepsons Mark Schmidt of Chico, Scott Schmidt of Sacramento and Craig Schmidt of South Lake Tahoe; five grandchildren; and two great-grandchildren. <br>
A memorial service is planned for 3 p.m. Friday in St. Michael's, 2140 Mission Ave., Carmichael.<br>

Thomas Plantagenet of BROTHERTON
<p>
<a name ="I007552"><b>[I007552]</b></a><br />
Thomas of Brotherton, 1st Earl of Norfolk (June 1, 1300-1338) was the son of Edward I of England and Marguerite of France. He was named in honor of St. Thomas.<br>
<br>
His father died when he was 7 years old. Thomas' half-brother, Edward, now became king of England. The Earldom of Cornwall had been intended for Thomas, but Edward instead bestowed it upon his favorite, Piers Gaveston, in 1306. When he was 10 years old, his brother Edward II of England assigned him and another brother, Edmund, the estates of Roger Bigod, 5th Earl of Norfolk who had died without heir in 1306.<br>
<br>
In 1312 he was titled, "Earl of Norfolk" and on February 10, 1316 he was created Marshal of England. When his brother went to Scotland in the war, he was left Keeper of England. Thomas was known for having a hot and violent temper. He was one of the many victims of the unchecked greed of Hugh the younger Despenser, who stole some of the young earl's lands. He allied himself with Queen Isabella and Roger Mortimer, 1st Earl of March when they invaded England in 1326, and stood as one of the judges in the trials against both Despensers.<br>
<br>
He married first, probably in 1319, to Alice Hayles, daughter of Sir Roger Hayles and Alice Skogan. She was supposed to have been a great beauty. Her father was the coroner of Norfolk, a title that held a different meaning in the 14th century than it does today; his post demanded that he collect and protect revenues for the king. Thomas and Alice had three children:<br>
   1)  Edward of Norfolk (c. 1320 - 1334)<br>
   2)  Margaret, Duchess of Norfolk (c. 1320 - 1399)<br>
   3)  Alice of Norfolk (1324 - 1352)<br>
<br>
Alice Hayles died in 1330, when a chantry was founded for her soul in Bosham, Sussex. Thomas was married before March 28 1335 to Mary Brewes, widow of Ralph de Cobham, Lord Cobham. He died in September 1338, and was buried in the Abbey of Bury St. Edmunds. Thomas was also a ancestor of 2 of the wives of Henry VIII of England, Anne Boleyn and Catherine Howard<br>
