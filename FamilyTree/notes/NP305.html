Spitfire Marjorie Cathlene Pellicciotti, formerly known as Marjorie Kraft, born on August 12th, 1927 has gone home to be with the Lord after bravely fighting a long battle with old age. Marjorie (Margy) attended deaf school in Manhattan, N.Y. and also the Rome School for the Deaf. There she met Carmen Pellicciotti whom she later married. They celebrated 58 years of marriage before he passed away in 2008. Margy worked at a sewing factory in Philmont N.Y. before her marriage and was a very talented seamstress. She utilized her superior sewing skills throughout her life to decorate her and her children ºs homes, make dolls and quilts, and to dress her daughters beautifully. She bred dogs as a girl, collected dolls, built fabulous doll houses, and also knew how to figure out a carpentry or building project, because she was so smart. She enjoyed a good card game, a steamy romance novel, and a cup of tea ( no sugar, please).<br>
She was often underestimated because of her deafness but quickly those who got to know her were " put in their place" by her cleverness, gutsiness, bit of temper, unabashed honesty, and racy sense of humor. She is survived by her two daughters: Carmelita DeCicco, engaged to Paul Dietershagen and Tammy Barbour, married to William Barbour; four grandchildren: Brian and Nicoletta DeCicco, and Nathan and Bianca Barbour; nieces: Carole(Rick) Robbins, Bonnie Kraft and nephew Daniel Kraft. She is predeceased by her husband, Carmen Pellicciotti, her parents; William and Hattie Kraft, sister Nellie( Frank) Sarkozy, and brother John Kraft and son-in-law Ben DeCicco.<br>
Though her soul is set free, she will be greatly missed by those of us left behind ,as no one could have had such a sassy and fiery mother. Marjorie's daughters would like to publicly thank her Columbia County Department of Aging case manager, Interim Health Care staff, Columbia County Meals on Wheels staff and volunteers, and her neighbor, Toni Merchant who all went above and beyond the call of duty and made it possible for Marjorie to remain safely in her home for so long. Also , a heartfelt thank you to the Pines Nursing Home staff that cared for her so compassionately in her final days. Your service to the elderly is precious and Godly.<br>
Memorial services are to be held Tuedsay , May 29th ,2018 at Bates and Anderson-Redmond and Keeler Funeral Home 110 Green Street, Hudson, N.Y. with calling hours 11:00 am to 1 :00 pm and funeral service to follow at 1:30 pm at Ghent First Reformed Church on Co.
