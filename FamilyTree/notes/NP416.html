From<br>
The History of Seneca County, 1876<br>
The early life of Erastus Partridge, connected with later successful effort, is replete with encouragement for emulative young men; and a brief sketch, while a fitting tribute to his memory, serves also as an exampler for those who would know how a poor boy may become the successful banker and skillful financier.<br>
Mr. Partridge was born near Norwich, Connecticut, on the 9th day of May, 179S. As in most instances of self-made men, pressed for means in early life, he won his way steadily to position, influence, and competence by industry and perseverance. In 1821 he came to this section of the State, settled at Cayuga, then a promising locality, where he engaged in the mercantile trade. Here was laid the foundation for successful and prosperous business, and here were the scenes and incidents to which in later years he frequently and fondly referred. During the year 1824 he established a branch store in Seneca Falls, and soon thereafter entered upon a large and lucrative trade; but it was not till 1837 that interests at Cayuga were transferred and a permanent removal made to Seneca County. From this time forward business increased, and his store became known as an established institution of the village. Keeping pace with town growth, his aid and encouragement were given to every worthy enterprise. He identified himself with various manufactures, and liberally advertising, made known to public favor his business interests. Kindly counseling and advising those who recognized his good judgment and ample qualifications and sought to profit by them, erratic conclusions were seldom made. Opinion or person was never obtruded, and he ever maintained both his dignity and deliberate judgment. He was ready to perceive, accurate to estimate character, prudent in opinion, and unswervable in principle. Remarkably successful in mercantile business, Mr. Partridge commenced private banking in 1848, and in the month of January, 1854, established the Bank of Seneca Falls, with a capital of fifty thousand dollars; himself president; his son, Leroy C. Partridge, cashier. This was the first bank organized at Seneca Falls, and was regarded by its business interests with no little pride and pleasure. The business of the bank increasing to an extent requiring all his time, Mr. Partridge disposed of his mercantile business, in the spring of 1856, to W. B. Lathrop, and devoted his entire attention to the banking interest. The bank, originally located in old Mechanics' Hall, was removed in April, 1858, into the new and commodious structure erected for banking purposes on Fall Street, and known as the " Bank Block." The bank, known as "individual," made contributory to the best interests   of the community, possessed its confidence and good will. Foreseeing and prudent, the great financial revulsion of 1857, which caused suspension of all but three or four banks of the State, found the Bank of Seneca Falls promptly meeting all its obligations, and paying in gold its notes presented for redemption. Known and continued as an individual bank until the inauguration of the national banking system, it was early changed by Mr. Partridge to "The First National Bank of Seneca Falls. - Associated with Mr. Partridge in the transaction of bank business have been his two sons, L. C. and D. E. Partridge, by whom the later affairs of the institution have been conducted.  <br>
The death of Erastus Partridge occurred January 20, 1873, at the advanced age of seventy-four years. Impressed by sense of loss, business houses were closed and all classes of citizens united in expressions of sadness and regret at his decease. As a merchant and as a banker, the dealings of Mr. Partridge were characterized by business exactness; advantage was never taken of necessity, and he was lenient in the extreme to his debtors. To the influence of Mr. Partridge upon the mechanical industries of Seneca Falls is due much of their stability and ultimate extension. His domestic virtues, his personal excellencies of character endeared him to his relatives. He was a kind husband, an exemplary and considerate father. He had, on August 6, 1820, married, at Homer, Miss Sarah Bruffee, daughter of "William and Anna Bruffee, and for more than half a century they had journeyed through life in company. To his widow and children he left the priceless heritage of a stainless name and the memory of an exemplary life. In his social relations, his disposition and bearing towards neighbor and friend were frank and courteous, while all recognized in him a citizen who combined in one character modesty, kindness, sincerity, and integrity. Of kindly impulse, the comfort of others was second only to his efforts for their business advancement. Unostentatiously and quietly he gave of his abundance to the relief of the needy. Happy in the timely aid of worthy and judicious investments, his influence is yet manifest upon men now prosperous, who attribute their success to his timely advice and assistance. Invaluable to the community, Mr. Partridge lived to see his adopted home puss the doubtful era of its existence, and firmly established as a successful business community, and it is in strict justice that wherever the early history of Seneca County shall be known, the name of Erastus Partridge shall be coupled with it.  <br>
Le Roy C. Partridge, son of Erastus Partridge, was born at Cayuga, July 16, 1832. "When about five years of age his parents removed to Seneca Falls. Associates of his school days recollect a high-minded lad, ardent in scholastic research, a student of mechanics, and a lover of geologic investigation.  <br>
Growing to manhood, influence, and usefulness, his cheerful and social disposition rendered his companionship attractive, genial, and pleasant, and surrounded him with "an extended circle of warmly-attached friends.  Employed in the Bank of Seneca Falls when twenty-one years of age, he became its cashier at the age of twenty-two. Later, he was vice-president of the institution, and upon the death of his father became its president. For several years he conducted an independent banking house at Ovid, - a great convenience to the people of the south jury district. This institution, known as the Banking House of Le Roy C. Partridge, under the direction and impetus of its founder, has proved a sound and thriving business, and is still continued, under the control of Mrs. Ellen Partridge. Mr. Partridge was also secretary and treasurer of the Seneca Falls Savings Bank.  <br>
While seeking no political preferment, he shrank from no public duty, and when elected by large majorities to the positions of President of the village and Supervisor of the town, he discharged the functions of the office with zeal and honor.  <br>
Le Roy C. Partridge was married in 1861 to Miss Ellen Deppen, daughter of "William Deppen, then a resident of Seneca Falls.  <br>
During the year 1874, failing health warned him to lay aside the onerous burdens borne for years, and seek in change of climate relaxation and recovery; but this was not to be, and in January, 1875, he returned to home and friends- to die. Medical skill and the promptings of affection were of no avail, and cheerfully, as in health, he bore with suffering, and passed away on the morning of February 6, 1875. The funeral took place at Trinity Church, in the afternoon of February 11, to which not only the friends at Seneca Falls, but many from neighboring villages proceeded. During the time of the funeral, at which the Rev. Dr. Guion officiated, all places of business were closed, and the bells of the village were tolled. Casket and church were adorned with floral offerings, and every mark of respect and sincere sympathy shown by the entire community. His remains were taken to Reatvale Cemetery for burial, and those who had so long and pleasantly known him in life now revert to the associations of the past, and study his character in public and private influences. So well, so favorably known, and so intimately connected with the varied and material interests of the village, his loss fell little short of a public misfortune.  <br>
In business and social relations his generosity was unstinted, and his personal inter- course with all won many sincere, devoted friends. In sterling mental qualities, and in the kindly virtues of the heart, he won a place in the affections of kindred and friends beyond the limit of expression. Eminently possessed of qualities and virtues of life, his friends were real, intimate, and numerous. Scorning to do or countenance dishonorable actions, his sense of honor was proverbial, and his business relations were characterized by a scrupulous observance of the true spirit and every letter of every agreement. Careful and sensitive of honor and integrity, the slightest shadow of reflection upon them was unendurable. Sympathizing with want and distress, in- stances are numerous where munificent gifts for religious and benevolent objects illustrate philanthropy; and happily situated to relieve necessity, most generously did he avail himself of his opportunities. Generous without being lavish, familar without loss of dignity, he constantly maintained a natural' ease and self-assertion which challenged regard, while good-nature, quiet humor, and courteous deportment marked him a favorite in social or business circle.  <br>
Closely identified with matters of finance, the honorable position reached by the First National Bank of Seneca Falls is greatly the result of his faithful and sagacious efforts. Realizing that the prosperity of business and manufacturing interests is the basis of successful banking, Mr. Partridge, wisely discriminating between the deserving and the unworthy, gave generous encouragement to these classes through periods of financial depression, and thereby contributed to the welfare and prosperity of the community at large. The domestic virtues, personal excellence of character, frankness and liberality of Le Roy C. Partridge were known and admired by all. Courteous and dignified, inflexibly exact, and scrupulously honest, he was honored for his worth. Himself beneficent, kind, and sympathetic, like qualities were awakened towards him in the minds of relative, friend, and citizen. Many besides his estimable family shared with them in grief at his death, and the name of Le Roy C. Partridge is deeply engraved and fondly remembered by those who knew him as a promising youth, a successful man, a kind husband, a valued citizen.   <br>

His store in Aurelius, Cayuga County:<br>
Erastus Partridge opened a store about 1821. About 1840 he admitted E. H. Waldo to partnership, and removed with his family to Seneca Falls, where he engaged in the banking business, retaining his interest in the business here till its close in 1850. About 1847 Waldo sold his interest to Albert C. Cook, Partridge's son-in-law, who continued till 1850. Samuel Fitch and Jotham W.

DESCENDANTS OF GEORGE PARTRIDGE OF Duxbury, Plymouth, MNSSACHUSETTS<br>
<br>
GEORGE PARTRIDGE, the first of the family in America, arrived at Duxbury,<br>
Mass., in or sometime prior to 1636. It is stated in Winsor's "History of<br>
Duxbury" that he came from the County of Kent in England.<br>
The first mention of his name upon the records of Plymouth County was in that year (1636), when he was granted five acres of land at Powder Point, with permission from the court to settle thereon. In the next two years and also in 1666, he received additional grants of land about Duxbury, amounting in all to about two hundred acres.<br>
Winsor styles him "one of the most respectable yeomanry of the colony." In<br>
1643 his name appears in a list of those able to bear arms. In 1646 he was constable. Of this office Winsor says: "This was an office of high trust and responsibility and none were elected to it but men of good standing."<br>
Later he was a "Surveyor of Highways" and a grand-jury man.<br>
He was either a private or a non-commissioned officer in Capt. Miles Standish's Company.<br>
He was one of the original purchasers of Middleborough.<br>
His will is recorded in Plymouth County Probate Records (Vol. 1, p. 225) and<br>
was dated June 26, 1682. An inventory of his estate was taken October 10,<br>
1695. So his death occurred between those two dates. His will was witnessed by two sons of Miles Standish, Alexander and Josiah, and reads as follows: "On ye 26th day of June in ye year of our Lord 1682. I George Partridge yeoman living in Duxborough being in sound mind and good and perfect remembrance praysed be ye Lord for it make & ordaine this my last will and testament in manner and form following first I commend my soul unto Almighty God my maker and Redeemer and my body I will that it be decently buryed and funerall charges paid together with all my just and lawful debts out of my estate.<br>
"I give and bequeath unto my beloved wife Sarah Partridge all my houses &<br>

-----------------------------------------<br>
From the History of Seneca County New York, 1876:<br>
Le Roy C. PARTRIDGE, son of Erastus Partridge, was born at Cayuga, July 10, 1832.  When about five years of age his parents removed to Seneca Falls.  Associates of his school days recollect a high-minded lad, ardent in scholastic research, a student of mechanics, and a lover of geologic investigation.<br>
Growing to manhood, influence, and usefulness, his cheerful and social disposition rendered his companionship attractive, genial, and pleasant, and surrounded him with an extended circle of warmly-attached friends.<br>
Employed in the Bank of Seneca Falls when twenty-one years of age, he became its cashier at the age of twenty-two.  Later, he was vice-president of the institution, and upon the death of his father became its president.  For several years he conducted an independent banking house at Ovid,-a great convenience to the people of the south jury district.  This institution, known as the Banking House of Le Roy C. Partridge, under the direction and impetus of its founder, has proved a sound and thriving business, and is still continued, under the control of Mrs. Ellen Partridge.  Mr. Partridge was also secretary and treasurer of the Seneca Falls Savings Bank.<br>
While seeking no political preferment, he shrank from no public duty, and when elected by large majorities to the positions of President of the village and Supervisor of the town, he discharged the functions of the office with zeal and honor.<br>
Le Roy C. Partridge was married in 1861 to Miss Ellen Deppen, daughter of William Deppen, then a resident of Seneca Falls.<br>
During the year 1874, failing health warned him to lay aside the onerous burdens borne for years, and seek in change of climate relaxation and recovery, but this was not to be, and in January, 1875, he returned to home and friends-to die.  Medical skill and the promptings of affection were of no avail, and cheerfully, as in health, he bore with suffering, and passed away on the morning of February 6, 1875.  The funeral took place at Trinity Church, in the afternoon of February 11, to which not only the friends at Seneca Falls, but many from neighboring villages proceeded.  During the time of the funeral, at which the Rev. Dr. Guion officiated, all places of business were closed, and the bells of the village were tolled.  Casket and church were adorned with floral offerings, and every mark of respect and sincere sympathy shown by the entire community.  His remains were taken to Restvale Cemetery for burial, and those who had so long and pleasantly known him in life now revert to the associations of the past, and study his character in public and private influences.  So well, so favorably known, and so intimately connected with the varied and material interests of the village, his loss fell little short of a public misfortune.<br>
In business and social relations his generosity was unstinted, and his personal intercourse with all won many sincere, devoted friends.  In sterling mental qualities, and in the kindly virtues of the heart, he won a place in the affections of kindred and friends beyond the limit of expression.  Eminently possessed of qualities and virtues of life, his friends were real, intimate, and numerous.  Scorning to do or countenance dishonorable actions, his sense of honor was proverbial, and his business relations were characterized by a scrupulous observance of the true spirit and very letter of every agreement.  Careful and sensitive of honor and integrity, the slightest shadow of reflection upon them was unendurable.  Sympathizing with want and distress, instances are numerous where munificent gifts for religious and benevolent objects illustrate philanthropy; and happily situated to relieve necessity, most generously did he avail himself of his opportunities.  Generous without being lavish, familiar without loss of dignity, he constantly maintained a natural ease and self-assertion which challenged regard, while good-nature, quiet humor, and courteous deportment marked him a favorite in social or business circle.<br>
Closely identified with matters of finance, the honorable position reached by the First National Bank of Seneca Falls is greatly the result of his faithful and sagacious efforts.  Realizing that the prosperity of business and manufacturing interests is the basis of successful banking, Mr. Partridge, wisely discriminating between the deserving and the unworthy, gave generous encouragement to these classes through periods of financial depression, and thereby contributed to the welfare and prosperity of the community at large.  The domestic virtues, personal excellence of character, frankness and liberality of Le Roy C. Partridge were known and admired by all.  Courteous and dignified, inflexibly exact, and scrupulously honest, he was honored for his worth.  Himself beneficent, kind, and sympathetic, like qualities were awakened towards him in the minds of relative, friend, and citizen.  Many besides his estimable family shared with them in grief at his death, and the name of Le Roy C. Partridge is deeply engraved and fondly remembered by those who knew him as a promising youth, a successful man, a kind husband, a valued citizen.<br>

A New Yorker Eloping with an Indiana Lady - A Scamp<br>
From the Cincinnati Gazette<br>
A Short time ago, Sandford S. Partridge, a young man belonging to a respectable and wealthy family at Seneca Falls, N. Y., ran off from Aurora, Indiana, with a young lady, a member of one of the principal families of that place.  He cam to this city and hired a buggy and two horses at Wm. Woodsʼ livery stable, with which he went off with the young lady.  A week or ten days ago, Partridge was apprehended and held to bail, by the Police Judge of this city, in $1,000 for his appearance to answer for the theft of the two horses and buggy.  Not being able to gain the required security, he was put in prison.  Immediately on his committal officer Rose started on a tour of discovery after the buggy and horses.  This journey was tedious and tortuous, but he succeeded in recovering the whole of the property.  At Palestine, Ia., a hundred miles north of Indianapolis, he found a horse, a set of harness, and the pole of the buggy. At Bloomington, Ill., he discovered the buggy and the second set of harness.  In Pekin, Ill., he found the remaining horse, and was thus able to restore to Mr. Woods all he had lost, as well as furnish complete evidence as to the criminal conduct of Partridge.<br>
Besides seduction and larceny, a yet heavier charge lies against Partridge.  A letter has been received by or Police from C. Tucker, Esq., of Buffalo, stating that Partridge aided by an accomplice, who is in prison, had obtained $1,000 from the New York and Erie Bank of Buffalo, the authorities of which place are anxious to have him in their power.<br>
