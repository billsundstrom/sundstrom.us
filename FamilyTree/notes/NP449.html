Sioux Falls - On Thursday, November 12, 2020, Dr. James R. Reynolds bid a final farewell to his loved ones as he was called to heaven and is now reunited with God, family, friends and former colleagues and patients. While Jim's work here is done, his love and legacy will continue to serve the community for generations to come.<br>
James Reynolds married his high school sweetheart, Debby Darroch, in August of 1964. Together they lived, laughed, loved, surprised and spoiled each other silly. For 56 years, the strength of their bond shone through in all of their many, many endeavors.<br>
A lifelong resident of South Dakota and graduate of Augustana College, Jim began his medical education at the University of South Dakota School of Medicine where he graduated first in his class. As the USD Medical School was only a two-year program at that time, he transferred to The Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine (class of 1969) for the final two years of medical school education. After completing medical school, he remained at Johns Hopkins for his residencies in general, thoracic, and cardiovascular surgery. Dr. Reynolds had an opportunity to remain at Johns Hopkins with an offer of a career in academic medicine, but his mission was always to bring his education home to where he began his medical career in South Dakota in 1975.<br>
Jim was a pioneer in bringing cardiovascular surgery to the state of South Dakota. His leadership was instrumental in the founding of North Central Heart in 1981. In 2001, Dr. Reynolds was a significant influence in the establishment of the Avera Heart Hospital of South Dakota which quickly became ranked among the very best heart centers in the country. As a true visionary in the advancement of medicine, Dr. James Reynolds was inducted into the South Dakota Hall of Fame in 2006.<br>
Dr. Reynolds served on numerous boards including the Avera Health Board, Sioux Valley Hospital Board, DakotaCare, and the South Dakota State Board of Medical and Osteopathic Examiners. He is a past President of the American College of Surgeons, South Dakota State Medical Association, and North Central Heart Institute, and continued to serve on the South Dakota Health Care Commission for many years.<br>
During all of those very busy years, Jim and Debby also raised a large and happy family including Dr. Branden Reynolds (Catherine), Amy Reynolds Minchin (James), Bethany Reynolds McKenzie (Matt), Timothy James Reynolds (Amanda), AnnMarie Reynolds Kreuger (Nathan) and countless dogs! He was also the proud grandfather of 12 wonderful grandchildren who fiercely adored him.<br>
Jim spent his days in the operating room and his evenings at the farm. He could go from a business suit to wrangler jeans faster than you can say, "John Deere!" His hobby farm brought him great joy throughout the years and was the perfect getaway for countless family gatherings, opportunities to learn from neighboring farmers and car rides to check on the mile-long shelterbelt he and the family planted by hand. Never one to thrive on idle time, Jim was even more than a father, a surgeon and a farmer. He was a hunter, a fisherman, a collector, a sailor, a world-traveler, a Nascar fan, a dog lover, a dedicated philanthropist, a mentor, a life-long learner, a prankster, the BEST joke-teller, a consummate host, and the greatest friend-maker. Jim's love for people was so genuine and insatiable. When encountering a stranger, he would commonly ask, "So where is home for you?" And so, yet another new friendship began.<br>
Above all else, Jim was the most humble and gracious gentleman; never one to put himself above anyone else. He would likely frown upon our touting of his accomplishments and accolades, but we (his children) are proud of him and everything he embodied.<br>
Jim was preceded in death by his parents, Harry and Rose Reynolds and his brothers, Roger and Charles (Chub) Reynolds. And while we celebrate their reunion, Jim will be so dearly missed by his wife, Debby, and their 5 children, spouses, grandchildren, and his beloved hunting dog, Chloe.<br>

Air Force Band concert set<br>
<br>
By Elizabeth Gorder<br>
Beacon reporter<br>
April 25. 2008 6:00AM<br>
<br>
The Air Force Academy Band will perform in Baltic in honor of Cadet Col. Jonny Reynolds, who recently became the first-ever cadet from South Dakota to be named wing commander of the 4,400 cadets at the Air Force Academy.<br>
Reynolds is a 2004 graduate of Baltic High School.<br>
"The band is coming to Baltic as a celebration," high school Principal Jim Aisenbrey said.<br>
The concert will be at 7 p.m. April 29 in Balticʼs high school gym.<br>
The audience could top 1,000 people, school district Superintendent Bob Sittig said.<br>
Reynolds said heʼs looking forward to the event.<br>
"I havenʼt had many opportunities to come home during my tenure here at the Air Force Academy. So I am eager to visit, especially considering the circumstances surrounding my return," he said.<br>
Aisenbrey said the academy contacted the high school to arrange the visit.<br>
There will be a gathering in the high school commons for band members, school staff and Reynoldsʼ family. That gathering is not open to the public.<br>
As wing commander at the Air Force academy, Reynolds commands the 4,400 cadets at the academy, which is located in Colorado Springs, Colo.<br>
He manages a staff of 62 cadets who carry out military duties and is responsible for maintaining military discipline, morale and the well being of each cadet. He also interacts with school officials, military brass, Department of Defense officials and others who visit the academy.<br>
During his time at the academy, Reynolds has been on the superintendentʼs list all semesters and achieved a perfect score of 500 twice in the schoolʼs physical fitness test and was the number one cadet in physical fitness.<br>
At Baltic High School, Reynolds was senior class president, president of the Student Council and National Honor Society, and played football, basketball and baseball. He also was on the schoolʼs golf and cross-country teams.<br>
Maria Reynolds, Jonny Reynolds' mother, said her son always has been goal oriented and decided in junior high that he wanted to go to one of the military academies. That decision was solidified, she said, after the Sept. 11, 2001, disaster.<br>
Reynolds will speak with high school juniors and seniors during his time home.<br>
"I will probably speak on setting and reaching goals, my military service, the Air Force Academy, skydiving, my world travel experiences and answer whatever questions they have," Reynolds said.<br>
Reynolds is on a NCAA national champion skydiving team.<br>
He will stay in Baltic April 27-30.<br>
After Reynolds graduates this spring from the academy, he will intern for the summer at South Dakota Republican Sen. John Thuneʼs office in Washington, D.C.<br>
After his internship, Reynolds will go to Texas to continue his military training.<br>
Reynolds plans to someday return to South Dakota and perhaps run for U.S. Senate.<br>
"Itʼs been one of his long-term goals," Maria Reynolds said.<br>
The concert is free, and four tickets per household will be allowed. For tickets, send a self-addressed stamped envelope to: Argus Leader, USAF Academy Band Concert, P.O. Box 5034, Sioux Falls, SD, 57117.<br>

The 1930 census of San Jose, California, lists Richard at age 23, with wife Myrtle, 21, and her parents, Henry & Ida M. Dolen. Richard was married at least four times, and had two sons Richard and Ronald with his third wife, Alita Jean Shutes.<br>

<a name ="I020723"><b>[I020723]</b></a><br />
His parentage looks to be WRONG. One source states that his father Robert had only one son by Thomasine and his name was John.<br>
It needs further investigation.<br>
