Joseph SEVERANCE
<p>
<a name ="I037047"><b>[I037047]</b></a><br />
Joseph Severance was born on October 26, 1682 in Suffield, Connecticut. He was the son of John and Mary Severance. His parents possibly moved to Deerfield, Massachusetts, because he is supposed to have fought in the "Meadows Fight," near Deerfield in 1704. On November 17, 1712 he married Anna Kellogg in Hadley, Massachusetts. In 1713 he was a soldier in the Colonial Service, and was wounded by Indians and crippled. He petitioned the General Court, 27 Nov 1734, asking "for some consideration on account of his wounds and disabilities," saying that "about twenty-one years ago he was wounded by an Indian enemy, being a soldier in the service of the province, & has been a cripple ever since, & like to be till his death, & forasmuch as he has never had anything from this govt. for his support." As compensation the General Court granted him, in 1735, two hundred acres of land, east of Northfield, bounded "south on a mountain called Grace." His father also gave him land in Deerfield. Joseph and Anna's children were all born in Deerfield. <br>
He became a tailor in Deerfield, where he owned a house and a home lot, possibly lot number 36 in Deerfield. He was a Corporal in Capt. Kellogg's Company in 1723 and Orderly in 1747, Selectman in 1722. A few years before his death, Joseph divided his land in Deerfield among his children and he and his wife went to live with their youngest son, Moses, in Montague, Massachusetts, where they both died. Joseph died on April 10, 1766 and was buried in the Old South Cemetery. Shelburne vital records of deaths, says, "Joseph, ʻa tailor, came from Wales, 1706.ʼ h. Anna Kellogg, at Montague, 1765." His house may still be seen in Deerfield.<br>

In 1861 he was a member of the State Legislature. <br>
August 14, 1862, he enlisted as private in Co. I., Tenth Minn. Vol., and served with his regiment in the Sioux and Civil wars, making an excellent record for fidelity and courage, and on April 4, 1864, was promoted captain of his company. When the war closed, he resumed the practice of his profession at Le Sueur and soon formed a partnership there with Judge Cadwell. In 1870, he removed to Mankato and was associated for one year with 0. 0. Pitcher, and then with D. A. Dickinson until 1875, when the latter was appointed to the District Court bench. In 1881, he removed to St. Paul, and formed a co-partnership with W. P. Warner, but returned to Mankato in June of that year to succeed Judge Dickinson, who had been appointed on the Supreme Court bench. He continued in the Judgeship of the Sixth Judicial District until January 1900, when he became associated with C. N. Andrews and resumed the practice of law, until his retirement from the strain and anxiety of active life in the summer of 1902. During his long and eventful career Judge Severance has been a prominent figure in the history of our state. An able lawyer, an eloquent advocate and a learned jurist, he has stood at the forefront of the bar, forum and bench of our commonwealth. <br>

His choice was once and for all. The law of God was the rule of his life, the love of Christ was the spring of his actions. As a husband, father, neighbor, Citizen, S. S. Superintendent, Elder in the church, he was a model man. Confined to his bed more than three months, he was self-possessed to the last. His brother , from Ohio coming ten minuted before his death, he recognized him. His last wish was that the dear ones left might by living faith in Christ, be ready to join him at the summons in Christs presence.<br>
