She also graduated from MTI in Sacramento. She loved the mountains and trees and two of her wishes were to have a home of her own away from town and a motorcycle to "feel the wind in my hair". She loved going to the casino, watching her brothers Donnie and Aaron race at Redwood Acres Raceway, spending time with her grandchildren, her friends, her dog and constant companion Bitchie "Pupperdo" and going to the family "cabin" in Dinsmore. She worked in the oil fields in ND, cooking for a group of 25 men and then at Cenex Gas in Ray, ND for two years before she became ill.

For Mv Diana Diana was beautiful in every way She marched to her own drum and that was okay She was opinionated and strong and more like me Than I ever realized until I began to see I wouldn't trade one minute of the last year spent with her In good times and bad, it didn't deter Our love for each other, as daughter and mother One of the things she always wanted was a place of her own Diana, may you finally rest in peace in your heavenly home.<br>
