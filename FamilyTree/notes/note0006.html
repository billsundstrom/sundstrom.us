Richard Egerden was the only known son of Rychard Egerden.  He was christened at the Parish Church in Wye on June 5, 1539, the parish record reading:  "Richard Egerden the Son of Rychard was baptized on the fyth day of June Ano [1539] [WPR].  Richard was a tanner by trade and resided in the village of Brook throughout his life.  The parish of Brook was formed from the larger parish of Wye in the 1560's.  Thus, while Richard was christened at the Wye Parish Church, all subsequent records of his family are found in the registers of the Brook Parish Church [see Brook Parish Registers; Bishops Transcripts, Volume 30; FHL #1751592, item #5 - hereafter cited as BPR].   Richard was listed as a Sideman in the Brook Parish Register under the year 1581 [BPR, pg. 16].<br />
 <br />
Richard Egerden was married twice.  By his first wife, Tamson (Thomasine), he is known to have had at least four children (possibly others who died young):<br />
 <br />
1. GREGORY3, christened at the Brook Parish Church on October 8, 1571 [BPR, pg. 6].<br />
 <br />
2. ELIZABETH, christened at the Brook Parish Church on March 13, 1575/6 [BPR, pg. 10].<br />
 <br />
3. MICHAEL, christened at the Brook Parish Church on February 1, 1579/80 [BPR, pg. 14].<br />
   He married (1) Joan Paine; and (2) Joan Wickens.<br />
   Michael was buried at Faversham, County Kent on March 8, 1628/9.<br />
 <br />
4. JOAN, married William Higgenson.<br />
 <br />
The burial of Richard's first wife was recorded in the Brook Parish Registers as follows:  "Tamson Egerdon the wiffe of Richard Egerdon was buried the 6th day of September 1604" [BPR, pg. 38].  On the same page of the parish register was entered Richard's remarriage, that is:  "Richard Egerden and Elizabeth Wiggent were married the 9th day of April 1605" [BPR, pg. 38].  Richard and his second wife had two children - twins:<br />
 <br />
5. WILLIAM, christened at the Brook Parish Church on January 27, 1607/8 [BPR, pg. 41].<br />
 <br />
6. FRANCES, christened at the Brook Parish Church on January 27, 1607/8 [BPR, pg. 41].<br />
   She married (1) Edward Goldsmith; and (2) John Coveney.<br />
 <br />
Richard Egerden died in the village of Brook in December 1609, and was buried at the Brook Parish Church on December 31st of that year [BPR, pg. 43].  He left a Last Will and Testament, dated October 28, 1609, which was proved on January 18th of the following year [see Canterbury Probate Records. Archdeaconry Court: Register of Wills. Vol. 56, 1605 - 1618; pp. 354 - 358, FHL #0188954].  A subsequent codicil to the will was dated December 25, 1609, thus placing Richard's death sometime between then and December 31st when he was buried, as aforementioned.  Richard's will mentioned his wife, Elizabeth Egerden, and five surviving children, Michael Egerden my soone", my daughter Joane nowe William Higgensons wyfe", Ffrancis Egerden my youngest daughter, Gregorye Egerden my eldest soone", and William Egerden my youngest soone", as well as two grandsons, Richard Egerden soone of the saide Gregorye and John Egerden my soone Gregoryes second soone.  Also mentioned in the will was a Thomasine Beers, but her relationship (if any) to the Egerden family is not known. According to Duncan Harrington, there was quite a family squabble over Richard's will.<br />

Gregory Egerden, son of Richard Egerden and his first wife, Tamson, was born in Brook, County Kent probably in September or October 1571.  He was christened at the Brook Parish Church on October 8, 1571 [BPR, pg. 6]. Gregory lived in the village of Brook his entire life, and like his father, followed the tannerʼs trade.  Gregory was active in the Brook Parish Church and served both as a "Sideman" (1598) and a churchwarden (1600, 1602) [BPR, pp. 31, 34, 35].  Gregoryʼs marriage was recorded in the Brook Parish Registers as follows:  "Gregorie Egerdon and Elisabeth [---]don were married the third day of februarye 1596" [BPR, pg. 28]. Unfortunately, a blot obliterates much of Elizabethʼs surname.  (The first letter appears to be an "E" or a "C" and the last three letters are clearly "don"; three or four letters in between are entirely illegible.)<br />
 <br />
Gregory and Elizabeth Egerden had five known children:<br />
 <br />
1. RICHARD, christened at the Brook Parish Church on August 21, 1597 [BPR, pg. 29].<br />
 <br />
2. JOHN, christened at the Brook Parish Church on January 20, 1599/1600 [BPR, pg. 32].<br />
 <br />
3. ELIZABETH, christened at the Brook Parish Church on June 3, 1604 [BPR, pg. 37]<br />
 <br />
4. JANE, married Henry Knight.<br />
 <br />
5. GREGORY, christened at the Brook Parish Church on February 9, 1614/5 [BPR, pg. 48],<br />
    and buried there on February 16, 1614/5 [BPR, pg. 48].<br />
 <br />
Gregory Egerden died in the village of Brook, County Kent in August of 1618, and was buried there on August 16th of that year [BPR, pg. 51].  He left a Last Will and Testament, dated August 15, 1618, which was proved on September 5, 1618 [see Canterbury Probate Records. Archdeaconry Court: Register of Wills. Vol. 56, 1605 - 1618; pp. 73 - 74, FHL #0188954]. Gregoryʼs will mentioned the following heirs:  "Elizabeth my wyfe", "my soone Richard Egerden", "my soone John Egerden", "Elizabeth Egerden my daughter", and "Jane my daughter".  No record has been found of the burial of Gregoryʼs wife, Elizabeth.<br />

 <br />
The documented roots of the Egerden family of Wye, County Kent, England go back to the early part of the sixteenth century.  RYCHARD EGERDEN was born there in the hamlet of Brook, Ashford Parish say 1519.  He is said to have had two siblings, a brother William, and a sister Godlyffe.  The former may have been the "Willyam Egerdon", whose son Willyam was christened at the Wye Parish Church on February 28, 1540/1 [see Church of England: Wye Parish Registers; FHL #1836327, item #13 -  hereafter cited as WPR].  The sister, Godlyffe Egerden, was married to John Allin at the Wye Parish Church on September 23, 1548 [WPR].  A number of other Egerdens were mentioned in the subsequent parish records of Wye and Brook, however their connection to the direct line presented here has not been determined.  It would appear that members of the family resided throughout the parish of Wye, as well as in the neighboring villages of Brook, Brabourne and Faversham.<br />
 <br />
There are indications, though unconfirmed, that the Egerden family may have resided in Wye for three or four generations at this time.  Records obtained by Duncan Harrington of Harrington Research Services (Folkestone, County Kent, England) noted the name of "Richard Egerden" in reference to a rental of the Manor of Wye circa 1452-54.  This Richard may have been a grandfather or other paternal relation of Rychard Egerden.<br />
 <br />
There is no record of Rychard Egerden's wife, and only one son has currently been traced:<br />
 <br />
1. RICHARD, christened at the Wye Parish Church on June 5, 1539.<br />
 <br />
Rychard Egerden died three months prior to his son's birth.  He was buried at the Wye Parish Church on March 7, 1538/9, the parish record reading:  "Rychard Egerton was buryed ye vii day of marche 1538"  [WPR]. (Note:  Surrounding entries on this page, together with the posthumous birth of Rychard's son in May or June of 1539, make it certain that the year recorded as "1538" represented old-style dating.)  There is no further mention in the Wye Parish Registers of Rychard's widow.  It is very probable that she was remarried sometime shortly after Rychard's death.  Unfortunately, marriage records for the Wye Parish Church did not commence until the year 1545, thus post-dating any probable remarriage.<br />

Rodrigo D́ıaz de Vivar (c. 1040 - July 10, 1099), known as El CidCampeador, was a Castilian nobleman, a military leader and diplomat who,after being exiled, conquered and governed the city of Valencia. RodrigoD́ıaz was educated in the royal court of Castile and became the alférez,or chief general, of Alfonso VI, and his most valuable asset in the fightagainst the Moors.<br />
El Cid was born circa 1040 in Vivar, also known as Castillona de Bivar, a small town about six miles north of Burgos, the capital of Castile. His father, Diego Láınez, was a courtier, bureaucrat, and cavalryman  who had fought in several battles. Despite the fact that El Cid's mother's family was aristocratic, in later years the peasants would consider him one of their own. However, his relatives were not major court officials; documents show that El Cid's paternal grandfather, Lain, only confirmed five documents of Ferdinand I's, his maternal grandfather, Rodrigo Alvarez, certified only two of Sancho II's, and the Cid's own father confirmed only one. This seems to indicate that El Cid's family was not composed of major court officials.<br />
 <br />
El Cid was married in July 1075 to Alfonso's kinswoman Jimena D́ıaz. The Historia Roderici calls her daughter of a Count Diego of Oviedo, a person unknown to contemporary records, while later poetic sources name her father as an otherwise unknown Count Gomez de Gormaz.<br />
Tradition states that when the Cid laid eyes on her he was enamored of her beauty. Together El Cid and Jimena had three children. Their daughters Cristina and Maŕıa both married into the high nobility; Cristina to Ramiro, Lord of Monzón, grandson of Garćıa Sánchez III of Navarre via an illegitimate son; Maŕıa, first (it is said) to a prince of Aragon (presumably the son of Peter I) and second to Ramón Berenguer III, count of Barcelona. El Cid's son Diego Rodŕıguez was killed while fighting against the invading Muslim Almoravids from North Africa at the Battle of Consuegra (1097).<br />
His own marriage and those of his daughters raised his status by connecting El Cid to the peninsular royalty; even today, most European monarchs and many commoners of European ancestry descend from El Cid, through Cristina's son, king Garćıa Raḿırez of Navarre and to a lesser extent via a granddaughter Jimena of Barcelona, who married into the Counts of Foix.<br />

Jimena Diaz of Asturias was born circa 1055. Died after 1113. Jim'sfamily is a mystery. Could also be a mystery at the same time he livedit. In the opinion of Maria Emma Escobar, in this family is odd, becausethe data that we know do not fit together, as if in his life he hadwanted to cover something weird. His parents were Diego Fernández (asshown by documentation of the Cathedral of Oviedo), Count of Oviedo, andCristina. Paternal grandfather: Ruy Alonso. Maternal grandparents:Fernando Gundemariz (the son of the Count of Oviedo skull, GondemarPinióliz) and according to some, Jimena de León (who died after 1037 andwas the daughter of Alfonso V, king of León and Urraca of Navarre: seeKings Kings of Leon and Navarra). Fernando's parents were GondemarGundemariz Pinióliz (1012) and Mumadona (a holy woman who his sonFernando, a wealthy scoundrel, he only dislikes). Paternal grandparents:some mention Pinolo Jiménez (969 to 1-II-1049/50, son of Jinen Jiménezand Aragonta) and Alonso Muniz (7-III-163/64, daughter of MunioRodŕıguez). Maria Emma Escobar argues that no evidence anywhere thatFernando was married Gundemariz Jimena de León (daughter of the king ofLeón). Fernando was married to the Galician Mumadona Ordoñez, daughter ofOrdoño Raḿırez (son of Ramiro III, king of Leon) and Cristina de Leon(daughter of Vermudo II). It appears that the confusion stems from JimenaAlfonso VI called "Suprino", something like a niece or cousin, but it islikely that this was because she probably descended from the InfantaCristina, daughter of Vermudo II and half-sister of Alfonso V. Maria EmmaEscobar also clarifies that Gondemar Pinióliz was not the son of PinioloJiménez. That was a mistake committed inconceivable that Menéndez Pidal,as is the nephew Piniolo Gondemar Jiménez Pinióliz: Aragonta Gondemar andhis sister were children of Piniolo Pinióliz Gundemariz. Jimeno JiménezAragonta married and were parents of Piniolo Jiménez.<br />

Seth Wilson, 92, died Monday, but the imprint that the Ozark ChristianCollege dean emeritus left on the Joplin campus is deeply embedded, saidMatt Proctor, OCC president.<br />
If ever a name could be connected with the pioneering of OCC, it would be that of Wilson, who in 1940 was tabbed as dean of the Christian-vocation school that started in Bentonville, Ark.<br />
Wilson, who taught 51 years in college and seminary classes, continued as dean when the college changed its name to Ozark Bible College and moved to Joplin in 1944. He retained that role until 1979. He also served as secretary to the trustees from 1942 to 1991, and he became dean emeritus in 1979.<br />
The college changed its name back to Ozark Christian in 1985, when Midwest Christian College of Oklahoma City, Okla., consolidated with Ozark Bible on the Joplin campus.<br />
"Any history of Ozark Bible College would have to start, 'In the beginning, Seth,'" said Ken Idleman, former longtime OCC president.<br />
Wilson received a bachelor's degree in 1936 from Cincinnati (Ohio) Bible Seminary, where he also took graduate courses and taught. He wrote several books, and hundreds of essays, studies and outlines related to the study of the life of Christ.<br />
"He declined an offer to teach in a graduate seminary, preferring to apply his life to reaching the beginning students, working with the churches, and getting more people to know and love the Lord," said Lynn Gardner, former OCC academic dean and professor.<br />
Wilson, a native of Maryville, was knocked unconscious in an accidental fall Thursday at his home, according to Leasa Frye, OCC public relations director. He was taken to Freeman Hospital West that day, but he never regained consciousness. He died about 3:30 a.m. Monday, Frye said.<br />
Survivors include his wife, Anna Wilson; four sons, Ben Wilson, Carl Wilson, Jonathan Wilson and Timothy Wilson; and six daughters, Leta Wilson, Rebecca Souder, Dora Desrosiers, Lois Miller, Judy Sullens and Joy Hill. No addresses were available for the children.<br />

A longtime Vancouver attorney who wanted to be remembered as "anold-fashioned country lawyer" died Thursday.<br />
Donald Simpson, 80, collapsed at his west Vancouver home Thursday morning. The cause of death was listed as coronary artery disease. He had suffered a series of heart attacks over the past several months and was told about a month ago by doctors that there was nothing they could do for his condition.<br />
A favorite among courthouse clerks, he visited the ground-floor Superior Court Clerk's office Monday to say goodbye. Simpson said his doctor considered him a "short-timer."<br />
He leaves behind a sterling reputation both as an attorney and as a gentleman whose clients would often become his friends.<br />
Simpson earned his law degree from the University of Washington and spent a year as a law clerk for the legendary Supreme Court Justice William O. Douglas. He spent a short time with a Seattle law firm and then worked as an attorney in the U.S. Army during World War II.<br />
He decided to return to his hometown after the war and open a law office. Over the next 50 years, Simpson became something of a legend himself.<br />
"He was the epitome of what a lawyer should be," Clark County Superior Court Judge James Ladley said this morning. "He was beyond reproach and his legal ability was outstanding. He was what you would aspire to be."<br />
His father, George B. Simpson, was the only Washington Supreme Court Justice to hail from Vancouver.<br />
Father and son started their own law firm in 1951 after George Simpson lost a hard-fought re-election bid for the state's high court.<br />
George Simpson died three years later of a heart attack.<br />
Even after his father died, Don Simpson kept his dad's hand-painted name above his own on the office door at 501 W. 12th St. "I'm not going to take it off. He was my father," Simpson said in an interview last December.<br />
Clark County had purchased Simpson's property to make way for an expansion of the adjacent juvenile center.<br />
Simpson moved out last April but kept his law practice going.<br />
He moved into a new office a few blocks away in the Hi-School Pharmacy headquarters courtesy of longtime friend and Hi-School Pharmacy president Steve Oliva. Simpson told Judge Ladley last week that while his health had declined, he was still working on a couple of cases for clients.<br />
"He was just an all-around accomplished but unassuming person," said longtime friend Ken Teter of Vancouver, who was a schoolmate of Simpson's and a fellow Eagle Scout. "He had great abilities, but he didn't flaunt them."<br />
He is survived by his wife, Barbara, two children, George B. Simpson of Vancouver and Patricia Simpson of Langley, Wa.; and three grandchildren.<br />
The office door will survive, as well. His son said he plans to take it off the hinges and save it as a keepsake.<br />

He then served as an attorney with the 101st Airborne Division of the Army in Europe during World War II, and attained the rank of 2nd lieutenant.<br />
After the war he returned to Vancouver and opened a law office, where he had practiced for the last fifty years.<br />
Mr. Simpson was a member of the Clark County Bar Association, Washington State Bar Association, American College of Trust and Estate Counsel and of the Royal Oaks Country Club.<br />
He was also a life member of the Vancouver Elks 823, and had been active with the Boy Scouts of America.<br />

The only known brother of Gunnor was Arfast/Herfast, of whom we gain whatlittle insight we have from a trial of heretics conducted by King RobertII of France. Arfast testified that he had pretended to join the sect,all the better to denounce them when the time arose. he later donatedlands to the monastery of St. Pere, to which he retired. He had at leasttwo sons.<br />
 <br />
During the famous trial of Herefast de Crepon (who was alleged to be involved with the Cathars) in 1022, the crowd outside the church in Orleans became so unruly that, according to Moore:<br />
    "At the king's command, Queen Constance stood before the doors of the Church, to prevent the common people from killing them inside the Church, and they were expelled from the bosom of the Church. As they were being driven out, the queen struck out the eye of Stephen, who had once been her confessor, with the staff which she carried in her hand."<br />

(VII) Edwin Cyrus, son of Edwin Ford Miller, was born at Haydenville, May10, 1867. He attended the public schools of his native village and theWesleyan Academy of Wilbraham, where he was graduated in the class of1882. Later he studied horticulture and pomology under Professor JohnCraig, of Cornell University, one of the foremost authorities on thesesubjects. From 1889 to 1896 he was a clerk in the First National Bank ofNorthampton. Since 1896 he has been associated with his father on thehomestead, "Hillside Farm," and lives in the house built by hisgrandfather. Besides the famous orchard, the farm has a model dairy. Hispractical and theoretical knowledge of fruit raising has been put intouseful practice, not only on the homestead which has become a model forthe orchards of New England apple growers, but as a consulting orchardistand institute lecturer. The farm produces an average yield of threethousand barrels of apples, and has some three thousand trees, old andyoung. Mr. Miller believes that ample proof has been given that applesrequire plenty of air and sunshine and that high ground is best adaptedfor growing apples in New England. Much of the Miller orchard is quitehilly, as the name implies. He is a regular contributor to the variousagricultural and horticultural publications, including The Homestead, TheNew England Farmer, The American Cultivator, The Greens Fruit Grower, TheFruit Grower of St. Joseph, Missouri, The Fruit Trade Journal, BetterFruit of Hood River and to the Springfield Sunday Republican. He ispresident of the Hampshire-Franklin Fruit Growers Association, and memberof the Massachusetts Horticultural Society, and the American PomologicalAssociation. For his lectures Mr. Miller has large photographs oforchards illustrating the points he is to make and when a lantern isavailable he uses the stereopticon. He lectures on all the phases oforchard management from setting out the trees to marketing the crop. Hispictures are said to be the finest of the kind in the country. Of hislectures in the Maine Farmers' institutes the New York Tribune Farmersays: "He not only dwelt upon the essentials of the business from theselection and preparation of the soil to the time the finished product isplaced upon the tables of the consumers in a manner that left every pointclear in the minds of his hearers, but by his earnestness, sincerity andenthusiasm, as well as the fact that he has shown by his acts that he hasfaith in the business, he imparted a desire to strive for the high idealshe has set for himself to every person in his audiences. Maine farmershave long ago tired of listening to the man who works from theories aloneand who builds fancy pictures about an imaginary business into which henever had courage to put his capital or the faith to put his future, andwhen a man like Mr. Miller comes among them he is sure of theirattention. Everyone who heard him will, from that time on, be betterequipped for the work he may be doing, and will have a lifelong interestin the work being done at Hillside Orchards on the hills ofMassachusetts." Of the orchards of Hillside Farm, the Horthampton Heraldsaid recently: "These apple orchards are reputed to be among the veryfinest in New England, if not the best - considering the care it is givenin every detail of first-class fruit production, picking and packing andthe alertness, celerity and persistency with which the owners perceive,adopt and carry out the most approved horticultural methods."

From Wikipedia, 12 June 2006:<br />
 <br />
Gruffydd ap Rhys II (died 25 July 1201) was a prince of Deheubarth in south-west Wales. He was the son of Rhys ap Gruffydd (The Lord Rhys) and grandson of Gruffydd ap Rhys.<br />
 <br />
Gruffydd was the eldest son of Rhys ap Gruffydd by his wife Gwenllian, daughter of Madog ap Maredudd prince of Powys. Rhys intended Gruffydd to be his main heir, and in 1189 he was married to Matilda, daughter of William de Braose, by whom he had two sons, Rhys and Owain. In Rhys' last years a feud developed between Gruffydd and his brother Maelgwn ap Rhys, both supported by some of their other brothers. In 1189 Rhys was persuaded to imprison Maelgwn, and he was given into Gruffydd's keeping at Dinefwr. Gruffydd handed him over to his father in law, William de Braose. In 1192 Rhys secured Maelgwn's release, but by now he and Gruffydd were bitter enemies. In 1194 Maelgwn and another brother Hywel defeated their father and imprisoned him, though he was later released by Hywel.<br />
 <br />
Rhys ap Gruffydd died in 1197. Gruffydd was recognised as his successor after an interview with Archbishop Hubert the justiciar, but Maelgwn used troops supplied by Gwenwynwyn ab Owain of Powys to attack Aberystwyth. He captured the town and the castle, and took Gruffydd himself prisoner, later handing him over to Gwenwynwyn who in turn transferred him to the English who imprisoned him in Corfe Castle. In 1198 Gwenwynwyn threatened the English holdings at Painscastle and Elfael, and Gruffydd was released from captivity to try to mediate in the dispute. His efforts failed, and in the ensuing battle Gwenwynwyn was defeated. Gruffydd retained his liberty and by the end of the year had captured all of Ceredigion from Maelgwn except for the castles of Cardigan and Ystrad Meurig. In 1199 he took Cilgerran Castle. Maelgwn made an agreement with King John of England, selling Cardigan castle to him in exchange for the possession of the remainder of Ceredigion.<br />
 <br />
In July 1201 another brother, Maredudd ap Rhys, was killed, and Gruffydd took over his lands. However on 25 July Gruffydd himself died of an illness and was buried in Strata Florida Abbey.<br />

[Edgerton.FTW]<br />
 <br />
The ancestry of Richard Edgerton has not been conclusively established. However, recent research conducted by Robert C. Edgerton, L. Welch Pogue and Brian G. Edgerton (among others) has produced a preponderance of evidence suggesting that may have been the son of Richard and Ellen (Stroud) Egerden, of Wye, County Kent, England.  Their son, Richard, was christened in the hamlet of Brook (in Ashford parish, Wye) on November 22, 1622.  No further record of this Richard is found in the parish records at Brook or Wye; and as Richard Sr. died prior to 1641, it is quite reasonable to suppose that Richard may have set out on his own, eventually emigrating to the New World, possibly for religious reasons or to escape the political turmoil of the English Civil War.  A "Richard Edgarton" from Ashford Parish in Kent County appears in Volume I of Charles E. Banksʼ Topographical Dictionary of 2885 English  Immigrants to New England, 1620-1650; however, Mr. Bankʼs source for this entry is not known.  For further details on the Egerdens of Wye, County Kent, England, please see The Tentative Ancestry of Richard Edgerton.<br />
 <br />
Over the years, a number of alternate theories have been proposed regarding the parentage of Richard Edgerton; however, none have offered any credible evidence to support them.  The most widespread of these, based upon family tradition, claims that Richard was the youngest of four sons of John Edgerton, Earl of Bridgewater.  According to the tradition, Richard emigrated to Saybrook, Connecticut in 1632, along with his elder brother, John (second son of the Earl of Bridgewater).  John Edgerton Sr. died in England in 1649, and upon the subsequent death of the eldest son, John Jr. (as the next-eldest son) returned to England to succeed to the familyʼs title and estates.  Richard remained in America, where he married and became the progenitor of the Connecticut line of Edgertons. This tradition, though long-held, has not yet been supported by any known documentation or research.  There are a number of accounts of a John Edgerton in Saybrook during its early years, but direct evidence of this is also wanting.<br />
 <br />
A similar scenario, placing Richard as the son of Sir Rowland Egerton and his wife, Bridget (daughter of Arthur Lord Grey de Wilton), is outlined in The Egertons of Oulton, by Sir Philip de Malpas Grey-Egerton (1869).<br />
 <br />
The first mention of Richard Edgerton in America is found on the records of Saybrook, in Middlesex, Connecticut.  From the Town Meeting Notes there, dated January 4, 1648, he was listed as owning a "house lot and three acres and a half of land".  At the same meeting, Richard was held libel for defective fences and allowing hogs in a neighborʼs corn field (see Saybrook Town Records - Printed Edition; Volume I; pg. 156).  In 1650, Richard was among forty proprietors who were granted additional lands in Saybrook.  There are several unconfirmed reports of Richard being in Saybrook as early as 1636 or 1637; but documentary evidence of this has not been presented.<br />
 <br />
A plat map of the early layout of Old Saybrook (reconstructed from Volume 1 of the Saybrook Land Records) was compiled in 1935 by Mr. Gilman C. Gates, of the Saybrook Historical Society, for his publication, Saybrook at the Mouth of the Connecticut River.  Richard Edgertonʼs home-lot, as shown on this map, comprised three-and-a-half acres and was located along the North Cove, with the Connecticut River to the north.  The home-lot bordered the Meeting House yard on the south, and the home-lots of Matthew Griswold and Joseph Hingham (to the west) and John Clark (to the east).<br />
 <br />
On April 7 (or 8), 1653, Richard Edgerton was married at Saybrook, Connecticut to Mary Sylvester.  The marriage was recorded twice - first at Saybrook (VR I:23), where it was noted only as the "marriage...of Richard Odyushun" (no mention of the brideʼs name), and later at Norwich (VRp I:34).  The former record gives a date of April 8th, while the latter lists a date of April 7th.<br />
 <br />
The parentage and ancestry of Mary (Sylvester) Edgerton has not yet been discovered.  The fact that her name was omitted from the Saybrook marriage record indicates that she was almost certainly not of that town, a fact confirmed by the complete absence of any Sylvester families mentioned in the early Saybrook records.  It has been proposed that Mary may have been a daughter of Giles and Mary (Arnold) Sylvester, whose family had settled on Shelter Island in the mid-1600ʼs.  Recent research into this Sylvester family, principally conducted by Mr. Henry B. Hoff, F.A.S.G., would appear to refute this supposition.  For further details, please see The Ancestry of Mary Sylvester, found in the Notes section of this database.<br />
 <br />
Richard and Mary Edgerton had three daughters born in Saybrook (Mary, Elizabeth and Anne), their births being recorded as the "children of Richard Odyushun" (VR 1:23), apparently a phonetic spelling for Edgerton, indicating how the name was pronounced at the time.  The family of Richard Edgerton was more fully recorded in the Norwich Vital Records (Volume I, page 34 of the published records), with a few discrepancies of dates.  The dates included here are mainly from the Norwich records, which are generally cited as the more reliable.<br />
 <br />
In 1660, the original town of Saybrook was largely abandoned, the majority of its inhabitants moving inland north, where they founded the town of Norwich along the banks of the Thames River.  The land there (comprising approximately nine miles square) had been deeded to them by Uncas, sachem of the Mohegan tribe, in gratitude for the colonistsʼ recent assistance in repelling a siege by the rival Narragansett tribe. The town was sanctioned by the Connecticut General Court in 1659, with the main migration taking place the following year.  Originally known by its Indian name, "Mohegan", the town was renamed Norwich in 1662, probably after Norwich, England, where many of the original settlers had come from.<br />
 <br />
Richard Edgerton was one of the thirty-five original proprietors of Norwich, and was granted a home lot, consisting of "six acres, more or less, abutting on land of Thomas Post on the southeast, abutting on the river on the southwest 10 rods & 10 feet, abutting  on the highway 12 rods & 12 feet."  Additional lands were assigned to him in later divisions, as noted in the Norwich Book of Grants.   He was admitted a Freeman of the Colony of Connecticut on May 14, 1668, his name appearing on the Norwich roll of Freemen the following year.  He served as Townsman (selectman) in 1678, and Constable in 1680.  Like the majority of his colonial counterparts, Richard probably earned his livelihood as a farmer and planter.<br />
 <br />
Richard and Mary Edgerton had six more children born in Norwich - four sons, John, Richard, Samuel and Joseph; and two more daughters, Sarah and Lydia.  The four sons each married and had families that perpetuated the Edgerton name in Norwich for many generations.  There appears to be no further record of the eldest two daughters, Mary and Elizabeth; they may have died in childhood, perhaps prior to the move to Norwich.  The third daughter, Anne (aka. "Hannah"), is generally reported to have married Thomas Willey "of Colchester", although the primary source of this information is unknown and there is no further account of the couple. The two younger daughters were also married and resided in Norwich - Sarah to Joseph Reynolds, and Lydia to Nathaniel Backus.<br />
 <br />
James Savageʼs Genealogical Dictionary of the First Settlers of New England, (Vol. II, pg. 100) provides the following entry for Richard Edgerton:<br />
 <br />
"EDGARTON, RICHARD, Saybrook, m. 8 Apr. 1653, Mary Sylvester, had Mary, b. 3 Feb. 1655; Eliz. 25 Dec. 1657; Ann or Hannah, 24 Sept. 1659; rem. next yr. to Norwich, there had John, 12 June 1662, Richard, 10 Mar. 1665; Sarah, Apr. 1667; Samuel, May 1670; Lydia, Apr. 1675; and Joseph, 8 Mar. 1677."<br />
 <br />
As of 1982, the Richard Edgerton house was still standing and was at that time one of only three of the original Norwich dwellings still in use. In 1959, the house was moved (due to highway construction) from its original location at 140 West Town Street.  The most recent location was 139 Sturtenvant Street, but it is reported that the city was again re-zoned and the house may have been relocated once again.   A photograph of the Richard Edgerton home (taken in 1982) is provided by Jessie Edgerton Garnerʼs Edgerton Tales and Details, 1836 - 1986 (Hanover, Illinois, 1986; pg. 5)  Robert C. Wolfert, of Ronkonkoma, New York (an Edgerton descendant), has provided some recent photographs of the Richard Edgerton house, taken in October 2000.<br />
 <br />
Richard Edgerton died at Norwich, Connecticut in March of 1691/2, his death being noted in the vital records there (VRp I:34).  He left a will, which was proved at New London County Court on June 7, 1692, as noted in the following entry under that date found in the New London County Court Records (unnumbered):<br />
 <br />
"The Last Will and Testament of Richard Edgerton Deceased together with an Inventory of sd Estate was Exhibited in Court, proved and ordered to be Recorded & power of administration is granted according to the will."<br />
 <br />
The will itself has not been discovered and was probably among those destroyed in a New London fire in September 1781.  The will was referred to in subsequent deeds and land transfers, from which some of its contents may be inferred.  From a Norwich deed dated April 1, 1695, Richard Edgerton sold to his brother Samuel, "all that my thirty acres of land lying on Middle Hill which was given me by my father as appears by his will, which thirty acres was part of my fatherʼs Third Division Lott" (Norwich LR 2A:208).<br />
 <br />
It is most likely that Richard divided his Norwich property among his four sons - they are all found owning lands in Norwich in the subsequent years.  At the time of his death, Richard still owned lands in Saybrook, Connecticut, which were apparently bequeathed to his children.  From a Saybrook deed, dated February 16, 1718/9, five of Richardʼs heirs - "Richard Edgerton, Samuel Edgerton, Joseph Edgerton and Joseph Reynolds & Nathaniell Backus in right of their wives Sarah and Lydia Decʼd" - deeded to John Edgerton and Joseph Edgerton, "Grandsons of Richard Edgerton", lands which had belonged to their father Richard Edgerton (Saybrook LR 2:527).<br />
 <br />
Richard Edgerton was probably buried in the ancient Norwich burying lot, which lay next to his home.  A memorandum on the Norwich town records notes that:  "The Towne hath purchased a burying place of Thomas Post - in the home lot of said Post - towards the rear of his lot."  This lot was adjacent to the Edgerton home, so it seems certain that Richard would have been interred there, as were most of the early settlers of Norwich. The Norwich Founders Monument, inscribed with the names of the thirty-five original proprietors (including Richard Edgerton), was erected on the site.  The cemetery later became known as the "Post and Gager" Cemetery.<br />
 <br />
No death record or burial site has yet been found for Mrs. Mary (Sylvester) Edgerton.<br />

By trade John Reynolds of Norwich was a wheelwright, and he lived inNorwich, probably working at his trade, some forty-two years. It was thisJohn Reynolds of Norwich who with Simon Huntington, Thomas Adgate, JohnPost and William Backus in October 1663, was made a Freeman at Hartford,the seat of the colonial government.<br />
John Reynolds Sr. became a Selectman of Norwich in 1669. In 1690, according to early custom, John deeded to his only living son, Joseph, half of the house and homelot, and the other half in reversion upon the death of himself and wife.<br />
John Reynolds, the immigrant, died at Norwich July 22, 1702, after living there some forty-two years from 1660. On a record dated January 31, 1701/2, he is mentioned as one of the first settlers "now surviving." His will is dated July 15, 1702, seven days before his death. The will mentions as survivors his wife Sarah, only son Joseph, and four married daughters, Sarah Post, Mary Lathrop, Elizabeth Lyman and Lydia Miller.<br />

From Wikipedia<br />
 <br />
Rhys ap Gruffydd (1132-1197) was the ruler of the kingdom of Deheubarth (South Wales) from 1155 until his death. Rhys was one of the more successful and powerful Welsh princes, but even he was forced to acknowledge English supremacy, and did so by accepting the title of "Lord" rather than "Prince" or "King", becoming The Lord Rhys (in Welsh, "Yr Arglwydd Rhys").<br />
 <br />
Rhys was the youngest son of Gruffydd ap Rhys, a prince of Deheubarth, and of Gwenllian, a sister of Owain Gwynedd. He was probably born in Ireland. Both his parents died when he was around four years old, Gwenllian as a result of leading her husband's army into battle in his absence, Gruffydd himself on his return. He was brother to Anarawd, Cadell, Maredudd. After the death of their father in 1137, all four brothers ruled and worked to expand the kingdom and raid neighbour ing princes. By 1155, following the death (Anarawd (1143) and Maredudd (1155)) or disablement (Cadell) of his brothers he became sole ruler of the kingdom. About this time, he built Aberdyfi Castle. As ruler, he proceeded to challenge the new king of England, Henry II (reigned 1154-1189). Having successfully held out against Henry for a year or two, Rhys was defeated and most of his territory was taken from him. This was the point at which he agreed to pay homage to Henry, and peace temporarily reigned.<br />
 <br />
In 1162, Rhys took advantage of Henry's absence in Normandy to attempt to recover some of his lost lands. This resulted once again in defeat, following which Rhys was taken to England as a prisoner. Once released, however, he went back to his old defiant ways. Henry, preoccupied with domestic problems, could not respond effectively, and the failure of the English troops in Wales and troubles in England helped Rhys to prosper. After the death of Owain Gwynedd in 1170 he was acknowledged leader of the Welsh princes and called himself "Prince of South Wales".<br />
 <br />
In 1171 he signed a pact with Henry II and helped the king suppress the rebellion of 1173-74. After Henry's death, Rhys was again active, revolting against Richard I and deeply involved in internal Welsh feuds. Rhys found it difficult to maintain his position, and was obliged to enter into a protracted struggle against the Norman lord, William de Braose. He died peacefully, an old man at the peak of his power, in 1197.<br />
 <br />
He was succeeded by Gruffydd ap Rhys.<br />

Robert the father on his marriage [apparently wife's name not known]received Little Woodham (Woodham Mortimer) in Essex from Henry II by theservice of 1/2 fee and probably Amberden (in Debden) as another 1/2 fee.In 1190/1 he, or his son, was assessed to the scutage of Wales for oneknight's fee of the Honour of Peverel of London in Essex. Woodham andAmberden were held by Robert the son in 1212 as one fee. The father'smarriage presumably took place in or before 1168, when he was pardoned adebt in the account of the sheriff of Essex. It is not easy todistinguish this Robert from his son Robert at a time when either mighthave been the tenant of Woodham, or to distinguish them from theirnamesake and contemporary Robert de Mortimer of Attleborough. . . Thereseems to have been as close a connection between the Mortimers ofAttleborough, and their said overlords as between Robert of Essex and theKing. It would appear likely that it was Robert of Essex, the protégé ofHenry II, who witnessed at Valoignes the later version of the treaty ofFalaise, some time in the early months of 1174, as being in the train ofKing Henry, while William de Mortimer of Attleborough was one of thehostages under that treaty for William the Lion--Earl of Huntingdon untilhis defeat at Alnwick in July 1174; also that it was Robert of Essex who,at Le Mans, witnessed a charter of Henry II, dated 1175-81 or 1177. Thatthere was a close connection between the families of Attleborough andRichard's Castle is suggested by heraldic evidence; by the recurrence inboth families of the names Robert and William (Hugh probably came in atRichard's Castle from Say); and by the few details that are known about ashadowy Pernel de Mortimer, who seems to have belonged to both families.Of her it is known that before 1199 (probably before May 1194) she heldland in Dengey Hundred, in which are Woodham Mortimer and Amberden, whichlater was given to Tiltey Abbey; that in July 1199, as a widow, she wasR. del Ech for dower in Cambe (where Mortimers of Attleborough had largeholdings); and in 1203 levied a fine with William de Buckenham as to theadvowson of Buckenham and land there--a Mortimer of Attleborough manor.<br />

From Wikipedia<br />
 <br />
Herleva (or Arlette) was the mother of William the Conqueror.<br />
 <br />
Little is known for certain about Herleva's background, or the circumstances of William's birth. The written evidence dates from a generation or two later, and is not entirely consistent. Probably she was the teenage daughter of a tanner named Fulbert from the small Norman town of Falaise, where they lived. Translation being somewhat uncertain, Fulbert may instead have been a furrier, embalmer, or a person who laid out corpses for burial.<br />
 <br />
Legend has is that it all started when Robert, the young Duke of Normandy saw Herleva washing in the river near his castle. He was unable to resist her and took her for his mistress. She later gave birth to his son, William in 1027 or 1028.<br />
 <br />
Their love affair didn't last. While Robert went on a pilgrimage, Herleva married Herluin de Conteville in 1029. From this marriage she had two sons: Odo and Robert, who both became prominent during William's reign. They also had at least one daughter, who married William, lord of La Ferté-Macé.<br />
 <br />
William the Conqueror had a (half or full) sister, Adelaide, who may have been Herleva's daughter, but could possibly have been a daughter of Robert by some other mistress. Adelaide married first Enguerrand, count of Ponthieu, second Lambert of Lens, and third Odo, count of Champagne.<br />
 <br />
Herleva probably died around 1050.<br />

During his third term, he was named vice chairman of the Ways and Means Committee and helped modernize the state's budgeting process.

The Wrights of Kelvedon Hatch are fairly well know in gene- alogy circlesas the Kelvedon Wrights. Records indicate the early family lived atDagen- hams as Sir John Wright(1) was Christened there on 27 Oct 1450, aswas his son John Wright(2) who was Christened on 12 Jul 1488, and diedthere on 5 Oct 1551. Olive Hubbard, the wife of John Wright(2) was alsoborn at Dagenhams, and Christened there on 22 Feb 1487. The same recordsalso indicate their marriage on 17 Mar 1509 at Dagenhams.<br />
 <br />
However, before Kelvedon Manor was purchased, John Wright, although had been recorded as in Kelvedon Hatch, was considered as a yeoman of South Weald. From this we can gather that the family had moved into the South Weald area from Dagenhams, sometime after his marriage in 1509. As of this writing, we do know that John Wright and his wife Olive Hubbard were in the Kelvedon Hatch area by 1522. Their son, John [Myddle] Wright was born 19 Jun 1522, Kelvedon Hatch, as was John [young] Wright, 4 May 1524.<br />
 <br />
The Kelvedon Manor was purchased in 1538, yet "The first Book of the Registers of St Peter" has "Johanis Wryght, son of Johanis of Wealdside, md. Alicia Wood, widow, 13 Sep 1541". This indicates that John and Olive Wright may have still lived at Wealside.<br />
 <br />
The "Eldest" John Wright remained in Kelvedon Hatch, while "Myddle" John, although born in Kelvedon Hatch, lived near Wealdside in South Weald and is considered by most as John Wright of "Wright's Bridge" [when looking at the map, it looks as though it is in Havering]. "Young" John was considered as John Wright "of South Weld".<br />

He married Elizabeth of Rhuddlan, daughter of King Edward I of England and his first Queen consort Eleanor of Castile, on November 14, 1302, at Westminster. She gave him 10 children:<br />
   1. Margaret de Bohun (September 1303 - 1305)<br />

Humphrey was killed while fighting Andrew de Harclay, at the Battle of Boroughbridge in a particularly gory manner. As recounted in The Greatest Traitor by Ian Mortimer, page 124:<br />
 <br />
    "[The 4th Earl of] Hereford led the fight on the bridge, but he and his men were caught in the arrow fire. Then one of de Harclay's pikemen, concealed beneath the bridge, thrust upwards between the planks and skewered the Earl of Hereford through the anus, twisting the head of the iron pike into his intestines. His dying screams turned the advance into a panic."<br />

 <br />
Aslaug, Aslög, Kraka or Kráka, was a queen of Scandinavian mythology who appears in Snorri's Edda, the Völsunga saga and the saga of Ragnar Lodbrok.<br />
 <br />
Aslaug was the daughter of Sigurd and the shieldmaiden Brynhild, but was raised by Brynhild's fosterfather Heimer. At the death of Sigurd and Brynhild, Heimer was concerned about Aslaug's security, so he made a harp large enough to hide the girl. He then travelled as a poor harpplayer carrying the harp containing the girl.<br />
 <br />
Once they arrived at Spangereid at Lindesnes in Norway, where they could stay for the night in the house of Åke and Grima. Åke believed that he saw precious items stick out from the harp, which he told his wife Grima. Grima then convinced him of murdering Heimer as he was sleeping. However, when they broke the harp, they discovered a little girl, who they raised as their own, calling her Kraka (Crow). In order to hide her noble origins, they forced the girl always to be dirty and to walk in dirty clothes.<br />
 <br />
However, once as she was bathing, she was discovered by some of Ragnar Lodbrok's men, who had been sent ashore to bake bread. Confused by Kraka's beauty, they allowed the bread to be burnt, and when Ragnar enquired about this mishap, they told him about the girl. Ragnar then sent for her, but in order to test her wits, he commanded her neither to arrive dressed nor undressed, neither hungry nor full and neither alone nor in company. Kraka arrived dressed in a net, biting an onion and with only the dog as a companion. Impressed, Ragnar married her and she gave him the sons, Ivar the Boneless, Björn Ironside, Hvitserk and Ragnvald.<br />
 <br />
Once Ragnar visited viceroy Östen Beli of Sweden and Östen convinced Ragnar of marrying the Swedish princess Ingeborg and of rejecting Kraka. At his return home, three birds had already informed Kraka of Ragnar's plans, and so she reproached him and told him of her true noble origins. In order to prove that she was the daughter of Sigurd who had slain Fafnir, she said that she would bear a child whose eye would bear the image of a serpent. This happened and she bore the son Sigurd Snake-Eye. When Östen learnt of Ragnar's change of mind, he rebelled against Ragnar, but was slain by Ragnar's sons at Kraka's behest.<br />
 <br />
When Ragnar was about to undertake his fated expedition to England, his failure was due to his not heeding Kraka's warnings about the bad condition of the fleet. When Ragnar had been thrown into the snake pit by king Ella, he was protected by an enchanted shirt that Kraka had made. It was only when this shirt had been removed that the snakes could bite Ragnar and kill him.<br />

He was a semi-legendary King.<br />
He is said to possibly be the Ragnar who entered the Seine in 845 with 120 ships. Charles the Bald deployed his army on both sides of the river and Ragnar attacked and routed the smaller contingent and hung 111 prisoners on an island in full viewof the other Frankish force who offered no more resistance. Ragnar sailed into Paris and sacked it on Easter Sunday. Charles the Bald paid him 7000 pounds of silver to depart in peace and thus gained six years free of invasion.<br />
 <br />
Another story says in his old age he became jealous of his son's reknown as vikings and raided Northumberland and was captured by King Ella who threw him in a snake pit. As he was being bitten he sang his death song starting each stanza with "Downwe hewed them with our swords" and in his dying breath prophesized, "How piglets would grunt if they know the plight of the boar!"<br />
 <br />
His sons did avenge his death by capturing King Ella, carved a "blood eagle" on his back, hacked out his ribs and pulled his lungs out spreading them across his back like wings<br />
 <br />
 <br />
Form Wikipedia<br />
 <br />
Ragnarr Lođbrók or Ragnar Lodbrok was a semi-legendary King of Denmark and Sweden who reigned sometime in the eighth or ninth centuries. According to the Danish chronicler Saxo Grammaticus, Ragnar belonged to the Swedish Yngling Dynasty. Both Saxo and Icelandic sources describe him as the son of Sigurd Ring, a king of Sweden who conquered Denmark.<br />
 <br />
Although he is something of a hero in his native Scandinavia, reliable accounts of his life are very sketchy and heavily based on ancient Viking sagas. Even the dating of his reign is not certain; there are sources that date it from 750-794, and others from 860-865. Neither matches with what we know of him, and he probably held power as a warlord from approximately 835 to his death in 865, perhaps only being recognized as king in the last five years of his life.<br />
 <br />
Life<br />
Ragnar was a pagan who claimed to be a direct descendant of the god Odin. One of his favorite strategies was to attack Christian cities on holy feast days, knowing that many soldiers would be in church.<br />
 <br />
Raids<br />
He spent most of his life as a pirate and raider, invading one country after another. He would generally accept a huge payment to leave his victims alone, only to come back later and demand more riches in exchange for leaving. But as the extent of his realm shows, he was also a gifted military leader.<br />
 <br />
France<br />
By 845, he was a powerful ruler, and most likely a contemporary of the first ruler of Russia, the Viking Rurik. It is said he was always seeking new adventures because he was worried that his freebooting sons would do things that outshined his own achievements.<br />
 <br />
In that year, he sailed southward, looking for new worlds to conquer. With 120 ships and 5,000 Viking warriors, he landed in modern France, probably at the Seine estuary, and ravaged West Francia, as the westernmost part of the Frankish empire was then known.<br />
 <br />
Also in 845, Paris was captured and held ransom by a Viking raider, whom the sagas say was Ragnar Lodbrok. The traditional date for this is March 28, which is today referred to as Ragnar Lodbrok Day by many Scandinavians. The King of West Francia, Charlemagneʼs grandson Charles II "The Bald", paid him a fantastic amount of money not to destroy the city. Ragnar Lodbrok, according to Viking sources, was satisfied with no less than 7,000 pounds of silver in exchange for sparing the city. However, that did not stop Ragnar from attacking other parts of France, and it took a long time for the Franks to drive him out.<br />
 <br />
England<br />
After he was done with France, he turned his attention to England. In 865, he landed in Northumbria on the northeast coast of England. It is claimed that here he was defeated in battle for the only time, by King Aelle II of Northumbria. Ellaʼs men captured Ragnar, and the King ordered him thrown into a pit filled with poisonous snakes. As he was slowly being bitten to death, he was alleged to have exclaimed "How the little pigs would grunt if they knew the situation of the old boar!"<br />
 <br />
Legacy<br />
One Viking saga states that when his four sons heard the manner of his death, they all reacted in great sorrow. Hvitserk, who was playing chess, gripped the piece so hard that he bled from his fingernails. Björn Ironside grabbed a spear so tightly that he left an impression in it, and Sigurd Snake-Eye, who was trimming his nails, cut straight through to the bone.<br />
 <br />
Ragnarʼs fourth son, Ivar the Boneless soon learned the details of his fatherʼs death and swore that he would avenge his fatherʼs killing, in time-honored Viking tradition. In 866, Ivar crossed the North Sea with a large army, met King Ella in battle, and captured him. He sentenced him to die according to the custom of Rista Blodörn, an exceedingly painful death. Although this story may not be accurate, like virtually all tales concerning Ragnar Lodbrok, his death had serious consequences. Ivar was the mastermind behind the attacks on the English mainland in the final quarter of the ninth century. He invaded East Anglia, and the following year attacked York. He was aided by the internal struggle for power in Northumbria-which he was of course responsible for by killing Ella. These wars were a prelude to the long struggle of the Saxons of Alfred the Great against the "Danes" a generation later.<br />
 <br />
Meanwhile, in France, the Vikings kept coming back for more booty. Among their feats was destroying the city of Rouen several times. Ultimately, many of them settled there permanently, in a land that became known as Normandy (for "Northmen", as the Franks called the Vikings).<br />
 <br />
Mythology<br />
Bragi Boddason is said to have composed the Ragnarsdrápa for the Swedish king Björn at Hauge. However, this does not correspond to what we know about the historical Ragnar. It is consequently said that in the Norse sagas, he was identified with a Swedish king Ragnar (770-785), the son of Sigurd Ring. According to legend, he married Aslaug and became the son-in-law of Sigurd the Völsung.<br />

From Wikipedia<br />
 <br />
In the Volsungsaga, Sigurd is the posthumous son of Sigmund and his second wife, Hjordis. Sigmund dies in battle when he attacks Odin, and Odin shatters Sigmund's sword. Dying, Sigmund tells Hjordis of her pregnancy and bequeaths the fragments of his sword to his unborn son.<br />
 <br />
Hjordis marries King Alf, and Alf sends Sigurd to Regin as a fosterling. Regin tempts Sigurd to greed and violence by first asking Sigurd if he has control over Sigmund's gold. When Sigurd says that Alf and his family control the gold and will give him anything he desires, Regin asks Sigurd why he consents to a lowly position at court. Sigurd replies that he is treated as an equal by the kings and can get anything he desires. Then Regin asks Sigurd why he acts as stableboy to the kings and has no horse of his own. Sigurd then goes to get a horse. An old man (Odin) advises Sigurd on choice of horse, and in this way Sigurd gets Grani, a horse derived from Odin's own Sleipnir.<br />
 <br />
Finally, Regin tempts Sigurd by telling him the story of the Otter's Gold. Regin's father was Hreidmar, and his brothers were Fafnir and Otr. Regin was a natural at smithing, and Otr was natural at swimming. Otr used to swim at Andvari's waterfall, where the dwarf Andvari lived. Andvari often assumed the form of a pike and swam in the pool. One day, the Aesir saw Otr with a fish on the banks, thought him an otter, and Loki killed him. They took the carcass to the nearby home of Hreidmar to display their catch. Hreidmar, Fafnir, and Regin seized the Aesir and demanded compensation for the death of Otr. The compensation was to stuff the body with gold and cover the skin with gold. Loki got the net from the sea giantess Ran, caught Andvari (as a pike), and demanded all of the dwarf's gold. Andvari gave the gold, except for a ring. Loki took this ring, too, although it carried a curse of death on its bearer. The Aesir stuffed Otr's body with gold and covered its skin in gold and covered the last exposed place (a whisker) with the ring of Andvari. Afterward, Fafnir killed Hreidmar and took the gold.<br />
 <br />
Sigurd agrees to kill Fafnir, who has become a dragon out of greed. Sigurd has Regin make him a sword, which he tests by striking the anvil. The sword shatters, so he has Regin make another. This also shatters. Finally, Sigurd has Regin make a sword out of the fragments that had been left to him by Sigmund. The resulting sword, Gram, cuts through the anvil. To kill Fafnir the dragon, Regin advises him to dig a pit, wait for Fafnir to walk over it, and then stab the dragon. An old man (Odin) advises Sigurd to dig several trenches also to drain the blood, and to bathe in it after killing the dragon; bathing in Fafnir's blood confers invulnerability. Sigurd does so and kills Fafnir; Sigurd then bathes in the dragon's blood, which touches all of his body except part of his shoulder where a leaf has stuck. Regin then asks Sigurd to give him Fafnir's heart. Sigurd tastes Fafnir's blood and gains the power to understand the language of birds. Birds advise him to kill Regin, since Regin is plotting Sigurd's death. Sigurd beheads Regin, roasts Fafnir's heart, and consumes part of it. This gives him the gift of "wisdom" (prophecy).<br />
 <br />
Sigurd met Brynhild, a "shieldmaiden," after killing Fafnir. She pledges herself to him but also prophecies his doom and marriage to another. (In Volsungsaga, it is not clear that Brynhild is a Valkyrie or in any way supernatural.)<br />
 <br />
Sigurd went to the court of Heimar, who was married to Bekkhild, sister of Brynhild, and then to the court of Gjuki, where he came to live. Gjuki had three sons and one daughter by his wife, Grimhild. The sons were Gunnar, Hogi, and Guttorm, and the daughter was Gudrun. Grimhild made an "Ale of Forgetfulness" to make Sigurd forget Brynhild, and he then married Gudrun. Later, Gunnar wanted to court Brynhild. Brynhild's bower was surrounded by flames, and she promised herself only to the man daring enough to go through them. Only Grani, Sigurd's horse, would do it, and only with Sigurd on it. Sigurd exchanged shapes with Gunnar, rode through the flames, and won Brynhild for Gunnar.<br />
 <br />
Some time later, Brynhild taunted Gudrun for having a better husband, and Gudrun explained all that had passed to Brynhild and explained the deception. For having been deceived and cheated of the husband she had desired, Brynhild plots revenge. First, she refuses to speak to anyone and withdraws. Eventually, Sigurd was sent by Gunnar to see what was wrong, and Brynhild accuses Sigurd of taking liberties with her. Gunnar and Hogi plot Sigurd's death and enchant their brother, Guttorm, to a frenzy to accomplish the deed. Guttorm kills Sigurd in bed, and Brynhild kills Sigurd's three year old son. Brynhild then wills herself to die, and a funeral pyre is built for Guttorm (killed by Sigurd), Sigurd, Brynhild, and Sigurd's son.<br />
 <br />
Sigurd and Brynhild had the daughter Aslaug who married Ragnar Lodbrok.<br />

Martha Johanna Bartz died on Feb. 17, at Dove Healthcare in Eau Claire,Wis., at the age of 92.<br />
Her victory service will be held at Messiah Lutheran Church, 2015 N. Hastings Way, Eau Claire, at 11 a.m. Saturday, Feb. 27, with visitation the hour before the service. Pastors Paul Tiefel and Bruce Naumann will officiate.<br />
Martha was born on Oct. 17, 1917, at home in rural Suring, Wis., the daughter of John H. and Susan (nee Hernlem) Bartz. Martha was baptized into the Christian faith on Oct. 28, 1917, by Pastor Andrew Plass of St. John Ev. Lutheran Church in Hayes, Wis. She was later confirmed in her Christian faith at St. John on April 26, 1931. Her confirmation verse was John 6:68-69. Martha attended Linzy Brook School and St. John Lutheran Grade School before spending her freshman high school year at Dr. Martin Luther College in New Ulm, Minn. The economics of the Depression required Martha to return home, and she was graduated from Suring Public High School on May 22, 1936.<br />
For a short time after her graduation, Martha worked in the kitchen of an orphanage near Chicago, but then she moved to Red Wing, Minn., to live near her maternal grandmother and work for her uncle and aunt at Quandtʼs Food Shoppe. After nearly 15 years, she left Quandtʼs to begin employment at the Carnegie-Lawther Public Library. Martha later entered the Red Wing Area Practical Nursing Program offered by St. Johnʼs Hospital and was graduated in 1966 as a Licensed Practical Nurse. She worked at St. Johnʼs Hospital until her retirement.<br />
After her retirement, Martha provided home health care for her landlady, Mrs. L.E. Claydon. In 1988, she moved to Eau Claire where she resided until her death.<br />
Martha enjoyed cooking, reading, and visiting with family and friends. She was soft-spoken, faithful, and caring in her relationships. She was a strong Christian and an active member of Our Redeemerʼs Lutheran Church in Red Wing and of Messiah Lutheran Church in Eau Claire. Perhaps because she did not have a husband and children of her own, there was extra room in Marthaʼs heart for her siblings, her nieces and nephew and their children, and her extended family. She was on hand to be a help and comfort at the time of her brother Conradʼs death as well as at the time of death of both her sisters. In many ways, she was a mother and grandmother to her nieces and nephew and their children. Martha will be remembered by her nephew and nieces and her other relatives and friends as a dear and gracious woman who lived her faith.<br />
Martha was preceded in death by parents, John and Susan Bartz; brothers, Conrad and Marcus; sisters, Irma and Eva; and two brothers who died shortly after birth.<br />
She is survived by nieces, Linda Alexander, Janet Pagels, Ruth Ahrens, Susan Lentz, and Beth Kranz; nephew, Paul Nolting; numerous cousins; and many friends.<br />
In lieu of flowers, memorials may be given for some aspect of the work of the Kingdom.<br />
Friends may offer condolences online at www.fullerspeckien.com. Fuller Speckien Hulke Funeral Home, 3209 Rudolph Road, Eau Claire, is assisting the family with the arrangements.<br />

2. Ruth, who married Benjamin Roscoe and had two sons, David and Bruce. She died in South Yarmouth in 1978 at age 68. Iʼve been in touch with her grandson James, who has been wonderful to exchange information with.<br />
3. Evangeline, nicknamed Vannie, who married Victor Shanks and had two daughters, Marilyn and Rosemary. She died in Manchester, Connecticut in 1994 at age 83.<br />
4. Arthur died in Brockton at age 69 in 1984. He married Mary Ann Doucette and had: Arthur, Janice, Susan, and Richard.<br />

According to various records Arthur worked as a wire cloth worker as a young man and then as a mail clerk for the railroad. His daughter June says he was a teacher for a time as well.<br />
Arthur and his sister, Ethel, (my great-grandmother) were close, so I found a lot of photos of his family and old cards/letters. This led me to his daughter June, whom I met in 2000. She was so friendly and welcoming and helped me identify her siblings in some of the photos I brought with me. She was the last of her siblings living, which must be difficult for her but she maintains a very positive attitude. Weʼve exchanged Christmas cards ever since.<br />
Susan died from a stroke in September 1933 at just 45 years of age. Arthur married second Mildred Brown on 1 May 1940. They had a daughter, Elizabeth, born in 1942. Arthur married third, Ida Rogers, whose nickname may have been May, in 1968.<br />
After his retirement, Arthur lived in South Yarmouth, Mass. on Cape Cod.<br />
Arthur passed away 20 July 1972 at a nursing home in Plymouth, Mass. He was 84.<br />

He married 26 Aug 1785 at St Johnʼs Anglican Church, Cornwallis, NS<br />
His bride was Lydia Sweet, b abt 1765 ar Cornwallis, Kings, NS.<br />
 <br />
Dr. Muriel V. Roscoe wrote in her geneology  - 21 June 1984<br />
On February 26, 1793, Josiah Sweet RUSCO, stonemason, bought land from Barnabas Tuttle LORD, some 15 acres on the right side of Silas WOODWORTH's 200 acre division. This was in the Cornwallis township of Kings County, Nova Scotia. The place is known as Centreville. He built a house and established the family home there. At that date, Theophilus, was (?) years old; James was 9; Lydia 4 and Joseph 2. William was born three years later, in 1796.<br />
Josiah died in 1812/13. In September, 1816, Lydia married Oliver THORP and moved to North Mountain. In 1819 Theophilus left for Petitcodiac, N.B., but ultimately settled in River Philip. James had married Isabell ROBINSON and moved to Hall's Harbour. Josiah married Catherine ATKINSON in October, 1820, and took up farming across the Minas Basin in what later was called West River. William had married on January 4, 1820, Amy Miner PORTER and they remained in the Centreville home.<br />
It should perhaps be noted when Theophilus and Josiah settled in River Philip and West River, they still were in Kings County, although in the township of Parrsborough. That portion of Kings did not become included in Cumberland County until 1840.<br />

"Being a single man, Francis was invited by a Mr. Thomas of Marshfield tocome to new England. He left the toen of Salisbury, Old England andsettled in Duxbury where he married Margery by whom he had 5 children."So wrote Hon.  Judge Zebulon West (1707-1770), a grandson of theimmigrant in Duxbury, who probably learned these facts from his father,also named Francis (1669-1731), who lived with his father in Duxburyuntil he grew up.

 <br />
He was married to Isabel D'Albini, rich heiress of William Albini IV. They reportedly had eight children:<br />
    * William de Ros, 2nd Baron de Ros (1255 - 1317).<br />
    * Isabel de Ros (c. 1244 - June 12, 1356. Married de Fauconberge.<br />
    * Mary de Ros (1245 - May 23, 1326). Married William de Braose, son of John de Braose and Margaret ap Llewellyn. Margaret was a daughter of Llywelyn the Great.<br />
    * Joan de Ros (c. 1252 - October 13, 1348). Married John Lovell, 1st Baron Lovell of Tichmarch.<br />

On July 3, 1257, Ros obtained from Henry III a grant of the free warren, in the lordship of Belvoir, by which the boundary was determined. In 1258, he was actively employed in Scotland, in delivering King Alexander III of Scotland out of the hands of his rebellious subjects; and at Chester, in resisting the hostile invasions of Llewelyn the Last. In the same year, he and his lady Isabel had a controversy with the Prior and Convent of Belvoir, relative to the right of presentation to the Church of Redmile (near Bottesford), which was amicably compromised by their relinquishing the patronage to the convent, for a certain compensation. In 1261 he obtained from the king the grant of a weekly market, to be held at Belvoir, on Tuesday; and of an annual fair on the feast of St John the Baptist, to continue for three days. In 1264, he was one of the insurgent barons who defeated Henry III at the battle of Lewes, and took him and the prince prisoner, confining them in Hungerford Castle. In 1264, de Ros was summoned to the parliament, which was called by the barons in the king's name. He died in 1285, and was buried at Kirkham.<br />

Igor Riurikovich, or Ingvar Röreksson, ruled Kievan Rus from 912 to 945.Very little is known about him from the Primary Chronicle. It has beenspeculated that the chroniclers chose not to enlarge on his reign, as theregion was dominated by Khazaria at that time. That he was Rurik's son isalso questioned on chronological grounds.<br />
 <br />
He twice besieged Constantinople, in 941 and 944, and concluded with the Emperor a favourable treaty whose text is preserved in the chronicle. Igor was killed by Drevlians in 945 and revenged by his wife, Olga of Kiev.<br />

Olga (also called Olga Prekrasa, or Olga the Beauty, Old Norse: Helga)(died July 11, 969 in Kiev) was a Pskov woman of Varangian extraction whomarried the future Igor of Kiev, arguably in 903.<br />
 <br />
The Primary Chronicle gives 879 as her date of birth, which is rather unlikely, given the fact that her only son Svyatoslav was probably born some 65 years after that date. She spent great effort to avenge her husband's death at the hands of the Drevlians, and succeeded in slaughtering many of them. After Igor's death, she ruled Kievan Rus as regent (945-c.963) for their son, Svyatoslav.<br />
 <br />
She was the first Rus ruler to convert to Christianity, either in 945 or in 957. The ceremonies of her formal reception in Constantinople were minutely described by Emperor Constantine VII in his book De Ceremoniis. After her baptism she took the Christian name Yelena, after the reigning Empress Helena Lekapena.<br />
 <br />
Olga was one of the first people of Rus to be proclaimed saint, for her efforts to spread the Christian religion in the country. However, she failed to convert Svyatoslav, and it was left to her grandson and pupil Vladimir I to make Christianity the lasting state religion.<br />

 <br />
Geoffrey Fitz Peter, 1st Earl of Essex, (Piers de Lutegareshale), (b. ca. 1162), d. 1213, was a prominent part of the government of England during the reign of Richard I and John.<br />
 <br />
The patronymic is sometimes rendered Fitz Piers.<br />
 <br />
He was from a modest landowning family that had a tradition of service in mid-ranking posts under Henry II. Geoffrey's elder brother Simon was at various times sheriff of Northamptonshire, Buckinghamshire, and Bedfordshire. Geoffrey, too, got his start in this way, as sheriff of Northamptonshire for the last five years of Henry II's reign.<br />
 <br />
Around this time Geoffrey married Beatrice de Say, daughter and eventual co-heiress of William de Say. He was the son of William de Say, 3rd Baron de Say, and Beatrice, sister of Geoffrey de Mandeville, 1st Earl of Essex. This connection with the Mandeville family was to prove unexpectedly important.<br />
 <br />
In 1184 Geoffrey's father-in-law died, and he received a share of the de Say inheritance.<br />
 <br />
When Richard I left on crusade, he appointed Geoffrey one of the five judges of the king's court, and thus a principal advisor to bishop Hugh of Durham, who was chief justiciar was one of the regents during the king's absence. Later that year, Geoffrey's wife's cousin William de Mandeville, 3rd Earl of Essex died, leaving no direct heirs. His inheritance was disputed between Geoffrey and his in-laws, and Geoffrey used his political influence to eventually obtain it for himself.<br />
 <br />
On July 11, 1198 King Richard appointed Geoffrey 'Chief Justiciar', which at that time effectively made him the king's principal minister. He continued in this capacity after the accession of king John. On his coronation day the new king also recognized Geoffrey as Earl of Essex.<br />
Spouse:<br />
    * m. Beatrice de Say.<br />
    * m. Aveline, daughter of Roger de Clare, Earl of Hertford.<br />
 <br />
 <br />
Children of Beatrice: (note that his sons by this marriage took the de Mandeville surname)<br />
          o Geoffrey de Mandeville, 2nd Earl of Essex.<br />
          o William FitzGeoffrey de Mandeville, 3rd Earl of Essex.<br />
          o Henry, Dean of Wolverhampton.<br />
          o Maud Fitzgeoffrey, who married Henry de Bohun, 1st Earl of Hereford.<br />
 <br />
 <br />
Children of Aveline:<br />
          o John Fitzgeoffrey, Lord of Shere and Justiciar of Ireland.<br />
          o Cecily Fitzgeoffrey.<br />
          o Hawise Fitzgeoffrey.<br />
 <br />
Geoffrey's first two sons died without issue. Apparently the earldom was associated with their mother's Mandeville heritage, for the earldom was inherited by the husband of their sister instead of their half-brother.<br />

Olaf was the first King of Sweden to become Christian.<br />
 <br />
From Wikipedia<br />
 <br />
Olof of Sweden or Olof Skötkonung/Skottkonung (the meaning of the cognomen is disputed) was the son of Eric the Victorious and Sigrid the Haughty. He was probably born in the latter part of the 960s and he succeeded his father ca 994. Our knowledge of Olof is mostly based on Snorri Sturluson's accounts, which have been subject to criticism from source-critical scholars.<br />
 <br />
According to the Sagas, his father Eric the Victorious ruled together with Eric's brother Olof Björnsson. When Olof Björnsson died, Olof was proclaimed co-ruler instead of his cousin Styrbjörn Starke. This happened before he even was born. At his father's death, he inherited the throne of Sweden and became its sole ruler.<br />
 <br />
In a Viking expedition to Wendland, he had captured Edla, the daughter of a Wendish chieftain, and she gave him the son Emund (who was to become king of Sweden), and the daughter Astrid. He later married Estrid, a christian girl and she bore him the son Anund Jacob and the daughter Ingegerd Olofsdotter.<br />
 <br />
Olof is said to have preferred royal sports to war and therefore, Sweyn Forkbeard retook Denmark, which Olof's father Eric had conquered. Olof also lost the right to tribute which his predecessors long had preserved in the Baltic States.<br />
 <br />
In 1000, he allied with Sweyn Forkbeard, who was married to Olof's mother, and with the Norwegian Jarls Eric and Sven, against the Norwegian ing Olaf Tryggvason. Olaf Tryggvason died in the Battle of Svolder and Olof gained a part of Trøndelag as well as modern Bohuslän<br />
 <br />
When the Norwegian kingdom was reestablished by Olaf II of Norway, a new war errupted between Norway and Sweden. Many men in both Sweden and Norway tried to reconcile the kings. In 1018, the earl of Westrogothia, Ragnvald Ulfsson and the Norwegian king's emissaries Björn Stallare and Halte Skeggesson had arrived at the thing of Uppsala to sway the Swedish king to accept peace and as a warrant marry his daughter Ingegerd Olofsdotter to the king of Norway. The Swedish king was greatly angered and threatened to banish Ragnvald from his kingdom, but Ragnvald was supported by his foster-father Thorgny Lawspeaker, who was the wisest and most respected man in Sweden.<br />
 <br />
Thorgny rose and held a powerful speech where he reminded the king of the great Viking expeditions in the East that predecessors such as Erik Eymundsson and Björn had undertaken, without having the hubris not to listen to his men's advice. Torgny, himself, had taken part in many sucessful pillaging expeditions with Olof's father Eric the Victorious and even Eric had listened to his men. The present king wanted nothing but Norway, which no Swedish king before him had desired. This displeased the Swedish people, who was eager to follow the king on new ventures in the East to win back the kingdoms that payed tribute to his ancestors, but it was the wish of the people that the king make peace with the king of Norway and give him his daughter Ingegerd as queen.<br />
 <br />
Thorgny finished his speech by saying: if you do not desire to do so, we shall assault you and kill you and not brook anymore of your warmongering and obstinacy. Our ancestors have done so, who at Mula thing threw five kings in a well, kings who were too arrogant as you are against us.<br />
 <br />
These arguments convinced Olof to follow his people's advice. However, Olof showed no signs of wanting to keep his promise, but married his daughter to Yaroslav I the Wise instead, and then the Swedes became restless. However, the impending rebellion was settled when Olof accepted to share his power with his son Anund Jacob. Olof was also made to accept a settlement with Olaf II of Norway at Kungahälla, who already had been married (unbeknownst to Olof) with Olof's daugher, Astrid, through the Geatish jarl Ragnvald Ulfsson.<br />
 <br />
Olof was baptised, probably by the missionary Sigfrid the Holy, ca 1000, and he was the first Swedish king to remain christian until his death. However, according to Adam of Bremen, the fact that the vast majority of the Swedes were still pagan, forced him to limit the christian activities to the already christian border province of Westrogothia.<br />
 <br />
His death is said to have taken place, in the winter of 1020-1021.<br />
 <br />
Since the 1740s, it has been claimed that he was buried in Husaby in the christian part of his kingdom, but it should be noted that such identifications are speculation, and by no means uncontroversial.<br />

He was in Plymouth in 1667 through 1671 and after 1673 in Martha'sVineyard. Dr. Thomas is the ancestor of all that name on Martha'sVineyard. He was a man of great skill and ability and was the first knownphysician on Martha's Vineyard. He also seems to have been a lawyer ofsome rank because he was called "the King's Attorney" in 1681 and "TheirMajesties Attorney" in 1690. he joined the Chase family, near Homes Hole,where he bought thirty acres from Ponit, the Indian Sachem, and lateracquired several hundred acres on the west side of the lagoon. In 1700,the households of Thomas West, isaac Chase & William Cottle comprised thetown and numbered twenty-seven persons. By 1702 the Wests alone numberedthirty persons.<br />
Dr. West and his wife became members of the Sabbatarian Church in Newport, RI in 1692. In 1702 he was excommunicated for not keeping the tenets of the church. His family, however, continued in good standing. At least six of the descendants of Dr. West were graduates of Harvard before 1800 and were distinguished clergymen in New England. His will dated 15 Jan 1697/98 mentions his six sons, but not his daughters, who however, are mentioned in a division of his real estate in 1722. His will also mentions "my brother Nathaniel Skiff."<br />

 <br />
Sviatoslav I, Prince of Kiev (c.945 - 972) was the warrior Varangian prince of Kiev, who carved out for himself the largest state in Europe and finally moved his capital to Pereyaslavets in Bulgaria in 969.<br />
 <br />
We have no information about Svyatoslav's minority and youth, which he spent reigning in Novgorod. His mother, Saint Olga, ruled as Kievan regent until his majority (c.963). Sviatoslav was notorious as a stubborn pagan who rejected the Christianity, which had been embraced by his mother ca 945.<br />
 <br />
Svyatoslav's life was spent with his druzhina in permanent warfare against neighbouring states. During his reign, he created an empire that stretched from the Volga to the Danube. His greatest success was the conquest of Khazaria, which for centuries had been one of the strongest states of Eastern Europe. By 965 he also defeated the Volga Bulgars, thus bringing under Kievan control the entire area of the Volga River. Then, as an ally of the Byzantine Empire, which was at war with the Bulgars, Sviatoslav decisively defeated the Bulgars of the Danube (968), thereby paving the way for victories of Basil the Bulgar-Slayer.<br />
 <br />
In moving his capital to Bulgaria, Svyatoslav intended to make it the center of his extensive empire. He was forced to give up the Balkan lands (971), however, in a war with the Byzantine Emperor John I. His unorthodox appearance was noted by the Greeks, who described him as having shaved one side of his head, and having a single large gold earring. During his return from the abysmal Byzantine campaign, Sviatoslav was ambushed and killed by the Pechenegs (972). According to the Primary Chronicle, his skull was made into a chalice by the Pecheneg khan.<br />
 <br />
Edward Gibbon upon Svyatoslav's war with Byzantium<br />
The Russian traders had seen the magnificence, and tasted the luxury of the city of the Caesars. A marvellous tale, and a scanty supply, excited the desires of their savage countrymen: they envied the gifts of nature which their climate denied; they coveted the works of art, which they were too lazy to imitate and too indigent to purchase; the Varangian princes unfurled the banners of piratical adventure, and their bravest soldiers were drawn from the nations that dwelt in the northern isles of the ocean. The image of their naval armaments was revived in the last century, in the fleets of the Cossacks, which issued from the Borysthenes, to navigate the same seas for a similar purpose. The Greek appellation of monoxyla, or single canoes, might justly be applied to the bottom of their vessels. It was scooped out of the long stem of a beech or willow, but the slight and narrow foundation was raised and continued on either side with planks, till it attained the length of sixty, and the height of about twelve, feet. These boats were built without a deck, but with two rudders and a mast; to move with sails and oars; and to contain from forty to seventy men, with their arms, and provisions of fresh water and salt fish.<br />
 <br />
Yet the threats or calamities of a Russian war were more frequently diverted by treaty than by arms. In these naval hostilities, every disadvantage was on the side of the Greeks; their savage enemy afforded no mercy: his poverty promised no spoil; his impenetrable retreat deprived the conqueror of the hopes of revenge; and the pride or weakness of empire indulged an opinion, that no honour could be gained or lost in the intercourse with Barbarians.<br />
 <br />
At first their demands were high and inadmissible, three pounds of gold for each soldier or mariner of the fleet: the Russian youth adhered to the design of conquest and glory; but the counsels of moderation were recommended by the hoary sages. "Be content," they said, "with the liberal offers of Caesar; it is not far better to obtain without a combat the possession of gold, silver, silks, and all the objects of our desires? Are we sure of victory? Can we conclude a treaty with the sea? We do not tread on the land; we float on the abyss of water, and a common death hangs over our heads."<br />
 <br />
The memory of these Arctic fleets that seemed to descend from the polar circle left deep impression of terror on the Imperial city. By the vulgar of every rank, it was asserted and believed, that an equestrian statue in the square of Taurus was secretly inscribed with a prophecy, how the Russians, in the last days, should become masters of Constantinople. In our own time, a Russian armament, instead of sailing from the Borysthenes, has circumnavigated the continent of Europe; and the Turkish capital has been threatened by a squadron of strong and lofty ships of war, each of which, with its naval science and thundering artillery, could have sunk or scattered a hundred canoes, such as those of their ancestors. Perhaps the present generation may yet behold the accomplishment of the prediction, of a rare prediction, of which the style is unambiguous and the date unquestionable.<br />
 <br />
By land the Russians were less formidable than by sea; and as they fought for the most part on foot, their irregular legions must often have been broken and overthrown by the cavalry of the Scythian hordes. Yet their growing towns, however slight and imperfect, presented a shelter to the subject, and a barrier to the enemy: the monarchy of Kiow, till a fatal partition, assumed the dominion of the North; and the nations from the Volga to the Danube were subdued or repelled by the arms of Swatoslaus, the son of Igor, the son of Ruric. The vigour of his mind and body was fortified by the hardships of a military and savage life. Wrapped in a bear-skin, Swatoslaus usually slept on the ground, his head reclining on a saddle; his diet was coarse and frugal, and, like the heroes of Homer, his meat (it was often horse-flesh) was broiled or roasted on the coals. The exercise of war gave stability and discipline to his army; and it may be presumed, that no soldier was permitted to transcend the luxury of his chief.<br />
 <br />
By an embassy from Nicephorus, the Greek emperor, he was moved to undertake the conquest of Bulgaria; and a gift of fifteen hundred pounds of gold was laid at his feet to defray the expense, or reward the toils, of the expedition. An army of sixty thousand men was assembled and embarked; they sailed from the Borysthenes to the Danube; their landing was effected on the Maesian shore; and, after a sharp encounter, the swords of the Russians prevailed against the arrows of the Bulgarian horse. The vanquished king sunk into the grave; his children were made captive; and his dominions, as far as Mount Haemus, were subdued or ravaged by the northern invaders.<br />
 <br />
But instead of relinquishing his prey, and performing his engagements, the Varangian prince was more disposed to advance than to retire; and, had his ambition been crowned with success, the seat of empire in that early period might have been transferred to a more temperate and fruitful climate. Swatoslaus enjoyed and acknowledged the advantages of his new position, in which he could unite, by exchange or rapine, the various productions of the earth. By an easy navigation he might draw from Russia the native commodities of furs, wax, and hydromed: Hungary supplied him with a breed of horses and the spoils of the West; and Greece abounded with gold, silver, and the foreign luxuries, which his poverty had affected to disdain. The bands of Patzinacites, Chozars, and Turks, repaired to the standard of victory; and the ambassador of Nicephorus betrayed his trust, assumed the purple, and promised to share with his new allies the treasures of the Eastern world. From the banks of the Danube the Russian prince pursued his march as far as Adrianople; a formal summons to evacuate the Roman province was dismissed with contempt; and Swatoslaus fiercely replied, that Constantinople might soon expect the presence of an enemy and a master.<br />
 <br />
Nicephorus could no longer expel the mischief which he had introduced; but his throne and wife were inherited by John Zimisces, who, in a diminutive body, possessed the spirit and abilities of a hero. The first victory of his lieutenants deprived the Russians of their foreign allies, twenty thousand of whom were either destroyed by the sword, or provoked to revolt, or tempted to desert. Thrace was delivered, but seventy thousand Barbarians were still in arms; and the legions that had been recalled from the new conquests of Syria, prepared, with the return of the spring, to march under the banners of a warlike prince, who declared himself the friend and avenger of the injured Bulgaria. The passes of Mount Haemus had been left unguarded; they were instantly occupied; the Roman vanguard was formed of the immortals (a proud imitation of the Persian style), the emperor led the main body of ten thousand five hundred foot; and the rest of his forces followed in slow and cautious array, with the baggage and military engines. The first exploit of Zimisces was the reduction of Marcianopolis, or Peristhlaba, in two days; the trumpets sounded; the walls were scaled; eight thousand five hundred Russians were put to the sword; and the sons of the Bulgarian king were rescued from an ignominious prison, and invested with a nominal diadem.<br />
 <br />
After these repeated losses, Swatoslaus retired to the strong post of Drista, on the banks of the Danube, and was pursued by an enemy who alternately employed the arms of celerity and delay. The Byzantine galleys ascended the river, the legions completed a line of circumvallation; and the Russian prince was encompassed, assaulted, and famished, in the fortifications of the camp and city. Many deeds of valour were performed; several desperate sallies were attempted; nor was it till after a siege of sixty-five days that Swatoslaus yielded to his adverse fortune. The liberal terms which he obtained announce the prudence of the victor, who respected the valour, and apprehended the despair, of an unconquered mind. The great duke of Russia bound himself, by solemn imprecations, to relinquish all hostile designs; a safe passage was opened for his return; the liberty of trade and navigation was restored; a measure of corn was distributed to each of his soldiers; and the allowance of twenty-two thousand measures attests the loss and the remnant of the Barbarians.<br />
 <br />
After a painful voyage, they again reached the mouth of the Borysthenes; but their provisions were exhausted; the season was unfavourable; they passed the winter on the ice; and, before they could prosecute their march, Swatoslaus was surprised and oppressed by the neighbouring tribes with whom the Greeks entertained a perpetual and useful correspondence. Far different was the return of Zimisces, who was received in his capital like Camillus or Marius, the saviours of ancient Rome. But the merit of the victory was attributed by the pious emperor to the mother of God; and the image of the Virgin Mary, with the divine infant in her arms, was placed on a triumphal car, adorned with the spoils of war, and the ensigns of Bulgarian royalty. Zimisces made his public entry on horseback; the diadem on his head, a crown of laurel in his hand; and Constantinople was astonished to applaud the martial virtues of her sovereign.<br />

Vsevolod I Yaroslavich (1030 - 13 April 1093) ruled as grand prince ofKiev from 1076 until his death. He was the fourth and favourite son ofYaroslav I the Wise by Ingigerd Olafsdottir. To back up an armisticesigned with the Byzantine Empire in 1046, he married a daughter of theEmperor Constantine IX and had by her a son, the future Vladimir Monomakh.<br />
 <br />
Upon his father's death in 1054, he received in appanage the towns of Pereyaslav, Rostov, Suzdal, and Beloozero which would remain in possession of his descendants until the end of Middle Ages. Together with his elder brothers Izyaslav and Svyatoslav he formed a sort of princely triumvirate which jointly waged war on the steppe people and compiled the first East Slavic law code. In 1067 Vsevolod's Greek wife died and he presently married a Kypchak princess. She brought him another son, who drowned after the Battle of the Stugna River, and two daughters, one becoming a nun and another Empress of Germany.<br />
 <br />
Upon Svyatoslav's death in 1077 he inherited the Kievan throne, but ceded it to the banished Izyaslav in return for his patrimony of Chernigov. Izyaslav died next year and was succeeded by Vsevolod. He was versed in Greek learning and spoke 5 languages. Last years of his reign were clouded by grave illness, and Vladimir Monomakh actually presided over the government.<br />

Eric the Victorious (VI), Old Norse: Eiŕıkr inn sigrsæli, Modern Swedish: Erik Segersäll, (970?- 995), was king of the Swedes during the second half of the 10th century.<br />
 <br />
The extent of his kingdom is disputed. In addition to the Swedish heartland round lake Mälaren it may have extended down the Baltic Sea coast as far south as Blekinge.<br />
 <br />
The Norse sagas relate that he was the son of Björn Eriksson and that he ruled together with his brother Olof Björnsson. He married Sigrid the Haughty, the daughter of the legendary Viking Skagul Toste, but would later divorce her and give her Götaland as a fief. Before this happened, his brother Olof died, and a new co-ruler had to be appointed. The Swedes refused to accept his rowdy nephew Styrbjörn Starke as his co-ruler and the controversy was settled when Eric suggested that the new co-ruler would be his and Sigrid's unborn child, on condition that it was a son. Styrbjörn was given 60 longships by Eric and sailed away to live as a Viking. Styrbjörn would become the ruler of Jomsborg and an ally and brother-in-law of the Danish king Harold Bluetooth. Styrbjörn returned to Sweden with a major Danish army, which Eric defeated on the Fyris Wolds at Old Uppsala.<br />
 <br />
According to Adam of Bremen, Eric would conquer Denmark and chase away its king Sweyn Forkbeard and proclaimed himself the king of Sweden and Denmark which he ruled until his death which would have taken place in 994 or 995. He is said to have been baptised in Denmark, but later returned to the Norse gods.<br />
 <br />
In all probability he founded the town of Sigtuna, which still exists and where the first Swedish coins were stamped for his son and successor Olof Skötkonung.<br />
 <br />
However, Adam of Bremen only gives Emund Eriksson as predecessor to Eric the Victorious, but it is possible that Emund and Björn were co-rulers, like Erik and Olof and their semi-legendary ancestors Björn at Hauge and Anund Uppsale.<br />

Harold Bluetooth Gormson (Old Norse: Haraldr blátönn Danish: Harald Blåtand, Norwegian: Harald Blåtann, German: Harald Blauzahn) (c. 958 - November 1, 986), sometimes Harold II, succeeded his father Gorm the Old as king of Denmark in 958 (or 959) and was king of Norway for a few years, probably around 970.<br />
 <br />
Although his predecessors had accepted Christianity at the instigation of the Frankish Carolingian kings in 826, heathendom remained extant among Danes and northerners for centuries. Harald Bluetooth embraced Christianity around 963, but whether this was a purely political move or the result of an actual conversion on Harald's part is impossible to say. His son Sweyn (Forkbeard) was baptized along with the rest of the royal family, and given the name of the Holy Roman emperor Otto the Great. Harold was wounded in battle against the forces of his son and successor Sweyn. He is believed to have died on November 1st, 986, although 985 and 987 are also mentioned, and is best remembered for having erected a large runic stone at Jelling:<br />
 <br />
    "Harold, king, bade these memorials to be made after Gorm, his father, and Thyra, his mother. The Harald who won the whole of Denmark and Norway and turned the Danes to Christianity."<br />
 <br />
Norway was ruled by his vassal Håkon Jarl, who had joined with Harold Bluetooth in a conspiracy against Harald Greyhide, and who now in reality controlled the country. Håkon Jarl broke his alliance when King Harold attempted to force Christianity upon him. Having resisted subsequent attack from Denmark, Håkon became de facto sole ruler of ruler of Norway to 995.<br />
 <br />
Harold may have had three wives or consorts: Thora, Gunhilde and Gyrid (the niece of the Swedish king Eric the Victorious). He is believed to have had four children: Håkon, Sweyn I, Gunhild and Tyra (who married Styrbjörn Starke).<br />
