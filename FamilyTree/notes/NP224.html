Myrtle Edna HAMMOND
<p>
<a name ="I076700"><b>[I076700]</b></a><br />
EVANS Myrtle Edna passed away on December 26, 1997, at 7:45 in the morning. Myrtle was the "Jean" in Bob and Jean's Cock of the Walk Tavern. Myrtle was born in Creighton, Nebraska on September 27, 1903, the tenth of eleven children born to the union of James Tecumseh Hammond and Mary Magdalene Bonge. She was preceded in death by her husband of fifty three years, Robert B. Evans. She was also preceded in death by her faithful and loyal friend Vonnie Kiel. Myrtle came to Oklahoma in 1905 in a covered wagon. Her family settled in rural Pocasset southwest of Oklahoma City. Myrtle began working in the Oklahoma City office of Southwestern Bell Telephone Company in 1921. She retired as Chief Operator in 1958 after a long and successful career. Myrtle and her husband owned and operated three taverns in Oklahoma City from 1946 to 1965. They established the first, located on Paseo Street, after World War II. In 1950 they established the Red Rooster and in 1960 they put in the Cock of the Walk, which they sold after Bob's health began deteriorating. Myrtle's many cherished family members and friends have missed her happy countenance over the past year and know she is in a far better place. Myrtle's indomitable will and determined spirit will always be remembered as she taught all of us many invaluable lessons. Myrtle accepted all people and their life styles. She will long be remembered for her flamboyant attitude and her many anecdotes. Even though Bob and Myrtle were without children of their own , they always had a soft spot in their heart for children and the down trodden. Myrtle began her life in very humble circumstances. Her mother died when she was 18 months old and her sisters, who have all preceded her in death, helped raise her. Her brot hers have also preceded her in death. Myrtle is survived by many family members and friends. Myrtle, through hard work and a positive attitude rose above her circumstances and has helped many people along the way. <br>

<p>
<a name ="I030602"><b>[I030602]</b></a><br />
Warren Smock Hance, 75, passed away after a long illness early Thursday morning (February 26, 2009  ) at his home in Grantham, NH. He was born on April 4, 1933, in Long Branch, NJ, the son of Winfield Hance and Janette (Smock) Kidde. Warren ''Skip'' to his many friends and family - graduated from The Lawrenceville School, Lawrenceville, NJ in 1951 and Dartmouth College, Hanover, NH in 1955. On December 1, 1956, he was married to Alice (Lou) Fridlund in Englewood, NJ. Skip and Lou were happily married for 52 years. Skip received his commission as second lieutenant in the U.S. Air Force and was stationed in Korea and New Mexico. After receiving a master's degree from Columbia University, he taught at the Buffalo (NY) Seminary and then became chair of the history department at Miss Porter's School in Farmington. From 1975 to 1983, he was headmaster at Miss Porter's. His commitment to education continued as director of development and alumni relations at Harvard Law School. He returned to Dartmouth in 1986 to serve as vice president for development and alumni affairs until his retirement in 1993. Throughout his life he actively supported the communities where he lived, most recently as chair and board member of the Hospice of the Upper Valley (now the Visiting Nurse Association & Hospice of Vermont and New Hampshire). Skip will be remembered by all who knew him for his wonderful sense of humor, his great love for the people and places of the Upper Valley, and his thoughtful devotion to friends and family. If there is a place that embodies these qualities, it is surely his former home near Upper Baker Pond and Mt. Moosilauke, where Skip and Lou tended to spectacular gardens, graciously entertained, and daily absorbed the beauty and tranquility of the north country. In addition to his wife, Skip is survived by his two children and their spouses: Allen St. John Hance and Amanda Anderson of Baltimore, MD, and Lindsay (Hance) and Christopher Kosnik of Silver Spring, MD; his five grandchildren: Jackson and Emily Hance and Connor, Ian and Luke Kosnik; and his sister and brother: Judy Castles of Newton, NJ, and Charles Hance, of Potterville, NJ.<br>

The complaint said that Threadgill was shot several times and that it appeared there were gunshot wounds to the back of his head.<br>
Hancock has been charged with an open count of murder and was being held Sunday evening at the Metropolitan Detention Center in lieu of a $30,000 cash only bond.<br>
