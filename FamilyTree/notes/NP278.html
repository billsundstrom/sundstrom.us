Eugene Bascom JOHNSON
<p>
<a name ="I037246"><b>[I037246]</b></a><br />
This is my great granddfather. I just received info from his grandaughter, my mother's cousin, that Eugene was not a Johnson but was "adopted" either legally or not, after Civil War. Perhaps father died in it. His "Father" was Francis Asbury Johnson b. in Bledsoe County, TN. son of Aquilla Johnson and Mary Scarborough. Francis' wife was Drucilla or Priscilla Elizabeth Payne (Bath Co., VA.). I wonder if Eugene was a Bascom and kept that as a middle name after being taken in by Francis A. Johnson. Eugene was born 3/1/1858 in Knoxville TN. His wife was Cynthia Rosella Hawkins. This is a shot in the dark. Thanks.<br>
