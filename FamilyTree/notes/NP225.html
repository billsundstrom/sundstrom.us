Oscar Gustave HANISCH

O. G. Hanisch Dies Sunday Morning - Former Sherman County Resident Passes Away at Age of 81 Years --<br>
This community was shocked Sunday when news flashed about the city that the venerable O. G. Hanisch had passed away in an Omaha hospital early that morning. Very few people knew of his serious condition which made it necessary for him to go to Omaha and enter a hospital for medical and surgical treatment.<br>
He was taken to Omaha by his son, Dr. E. C. Hanisch on Friday. He submitted to a slight operation on Saturday, but that night conditions turned against him and he passed to his well earned reward in heaven Sunday morning.<br>
Oscar Gustav Hanisch was born July 9, 1852 at Koschmin, Germany, and died November 12, 1933, in Omaha at the age of 81 years, 4 months and 3 days. He spent his early boyhood at Koschmin. After completing his common school education, at the age of 14 years, he was apprenticed as a harness maker. His apprenticeship having been completed he offered his service to his country as a soldier in the Franco-Prussian War, but was refused because of his youth. However his services were accepted in the military harness shop at Spandau, Germany, where he served until the close of the war.<br>
Following that war he came to America alone, where he had no relatives, no friends, nor did he have any money to speak of. He worked at his trade in New York City for a time, but his adverturous nature led him to turn westward and he worked in Chicago and other places until he finally landed in Omaha where he remained for a time working at his trade.<br>
His next move brought him to Howard county. When he came to this county he established a grist mill on Oak Creek, in Kelso precinct, about 4 1/2 miles south of where the village of Farwell now stands. He operated that mill for a number of years and was getting along in nice shape until the high water that rushed down Oak Creek occasionally, swept away dam after dam and in the end he was unable to continue in the mill business. All his savings were swept away and he had to turn to other means of making a living for his family. <br>
On March 11, 1881 he was married to Miss Louisa Dietrichs, and to this union 9 children were born. They lived near the mill for a short time and then moved to their homestead 3 1/2 miles north of Rockville, where they went through all the hardships and privations of the early homesteaders in this part of the state. Later the Hanisch family moved to a farm adjoining Rockville where they lived for many years. In February 1927, they retired from the farm and moved to St. Paul, and they have resided here since that time.<br>
Mrs. Hanisch, 3 sons, Gustav F. Hanisch of Rockville, Dr. Edward C. Hanisch of St. Paul, and Dr. Louis E. Hanisch of Omaha; and 5 daughters, Mrs. Glen Paulsen, Palmer, Mrs. D. C. Hankey, Council Blufs, Iowa, Mrs. R. H. Buss, Ravenna, Mrs. Elmer T. Strom, Omaha, Mrs Roy M. Hibbin, Omaha are left to mourn his death. Also there are 21 grand children, 1 brother Emil of Duval, Washington and 1 sister, Mrs. Eda Lody of Koschmin, Germany.<br>
Two years ago, on March 11, Mr. and Mrs. Hanisch celebrated their golden wedding anniversary on the home place at Rockville, where they spent so many years doing their part to make that part of the country grow and prosper and be a suitable place in which to live and enjoy life. At the golden wedding anniversary all the members of the family were present, the first time the entire group were together in 20 years. The children can now look back on that occasion and take a lot of comfort in having been present.<br>
Mr. Hanisch was a man of strong character. He was able to figure out what should be done and how it should be done, and as a rule he was equal to all occasions that might arise. Honest and honorable in all his dealings with his fellow man, he reared a fine family of children who are an honor and a credit to their parents and the communities in which they reside. It took men with strong and vigorous minds and bodies to do things in those early days. Take for instance the work of Mr. Hanisch in the mill on Oak Creek. He had to transport the products of his mill to Grand Island by ox team in those days. Certainly a hard job when you consider that today you can transport a truck load from that old mill site to Grand Island in an hour, where in those days it took days.<br>
Mr. Hanisch was of a quiet, unassuming nature. He attended to his own business and never bothered any man. He was an ideal citizen, a good husband, a good father and a man that all could look up to and admire. He has lived here and he goes to his reward with the highest esteem of all his friends and neighbors.<br>
When a man has lived more than 81 years, and goes to his reward, usually there is little reason why condolence and sympathy be extended to the bereaved and sorrowing family. The reason being that in most cases the deceased is not very well able to take care of himself and he is a care and a burden to his family. Many persons of that age do not have a home of their own, but live around with their children. In this case Mr. Hanisch was in robust health until very recently and he had a fine home in this city and was enjoying life to the fullest extent. In this case we tender condolence and sympathy to the bereaved family and especially to Mrs. Hanisch, who will be left alone after 52 years of constant companionship with the man of her choice. They have had an exceptionally happy life well spent, and now that the family ties have been broken, Mrs. Hanisch can take a lot of comfort as she looks back over the half century that she and her husband worked together in a common purpose-to make this world a better place in which to live, and to rear a family of good children. They succeeded in both undertakings.<br>
The funeral will be held Thursday afternoon at 1:30 o'clock from Rockville, and any one wishing to attend the funeral from this city, and who may not have a way to make the trip to that city, will be provided with a way to going to the funeral. -- Contributed by the St. Paul Phonograph. <br>
