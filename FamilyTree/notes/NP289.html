Arthur Thacher KELLEY
<p>
<a name ="I035157"><b>[I035157]</b></a><br />
Arthur was born Brockton, Mass., 23 March 1888, the third son of David Howes and Mary Ann Kelley. He was born in Brockton when his parents lived there briefly, but grew up mostly in West Dennis, MA.<br>
Arthur married first Susan Herrick Gage in Providence, Rhode Island on 8 October 1906. She was the daughter of Richard Gage and Hannah Ellis. They had nine children together: <br>
1. Ralph, who married first a woman named Olive and had a daughter Beverly. He married second a woman named Philomena. He died in South Yarmouth in 1982 at age 74.<br>
2. Ruth, who married Benjamin Roscoe and had two sons, David and Bruce. She died in South Yarmouth in 1978 at age 68. I始ve been in touch with her grandson James, who has been wonderful to exchange information with.<br>
3. Evangeline, nicknamed Vannie, who married Victor Shanks and had two daughters, Marilyn and Rosemary. She died in Manchester, Connecticut in 1994 at age 83.<br>
4. Arthur died in Brockton at age 69 in 1984. He married Mary Ann Doucette and had: Arthur, Janice, Susan, and Richard.  <br>
5. Avis married John Sullivan and had one son, Dennis. She died in 1961 at age 45, leaving a son of about 10 years of age.<br>
6. Hazel died 1938, in Avon, at just 19 years of age, of rheumatic fever. <br>
7. Virginia who died at age 5 in 1926 in Avon. <br>
8. June married Norman Willard and had a son, Timothy. She lives is Florida.<br>
9. Claire, who married Herbert DeMers and had: Herbert, Dennis, Donald, Cathleen. She died at age 64 in 1989 in Brockton. <br>
They raised their large family in Avon, Mass. Arthur was raised in the Reorganized Latter Day Saint Church, but at some point became a Baptist. <br>
According to various records Arthur worked as a wire cloth worker as a young man and then as a mail clerk for the railroad. His daughter June says he was a teacher for a time as well.<br>
Arthur and his sister, Ethel, (my great-grandmother) were close, so I found a lot of photos of his family and old cards/letters. This led me to his daughter June, whom I met in 2000. She was so friendly and welcoming and helped me identify her siblings in some of the photos I brought with me. She was the last of her siblings living, which must be difficult for her but she maintains a very positive attitude. We始ve exchanged Christmas cards ever since.<br>
Susan died from a stroke in September 1933 at just 45 years of age. Arthur married second Mildred Brown on 1 May 1940. They had a daughter, Elizabeth, born in 1942. Arthur married third, Ida Rogers, whose nickname may have been May, in 1968.<br>
After his retirement, Arthur lived in South Yarmouth, Mass. on Cape Cod.<br>
Arthur passed away 20 July 1972 at a nursing home in Plymouth, Mass. He was 84. <br>

John Bates KELLY
<p>
<a name ="I011784"><b>[I011784]</b></a><br />
Hon. John Bates Kelly, now deceased, was born in Perrysburgh, Ohio, January 24, 1856, son of Robert and Amanda (Donaldson) Kelly, native of Virginia. The father died when Mr. Kelly was an infant, and the mother came to Minnesota with her five sons in 1864, and settled in Eureka township, but removed later to McLeod county, where she died October, 1899. Of the sons, Frank, who served in the Civil War; Henry K., of Minneapolis and George H., are dead. Hon. A. B., of Northfield, is living; and Hon. J. B., the subject of this sketch, is dead. <br>
Mr. Kelly received his education in Stevens Seminary, at Glencoe, Minn., and after leaving school worked on the railroad for a year. In the spring of 1873 he returned to Eureka township, and secured employment on the farm of A. R. Kingsley. In 1883 he was appointed cloak room keeper at the capitol for the state legislature, which position he held for two terms. In 1903 he was elected a member of the legislature from the 30th district, and served two terms, being re-elected in 1905. He was married October 13, 1875, to Minnie C. Kingsley, born in Eureka township, October 13, 1857, daughter of Ansel R. Kingsley and Maria J. Lumsden, his wife. Ansel R. Kingsley was born at Williamsburgh, Mass., May 29, 1823, and came to Minnesota in 1854, where he pre-empted 160 acres of land in Eureka township and engaged in farming. He was twice married. His first wife died when he was on his trip west, leaving him with one son, Dwight H., now of Scranton, North Dakota, and he was married later to Maria J. Lumsden, a native of New York, who bore him one daughter, Minnie. The mother died January 15, 1859, and the father January 2, 1905. To Mr. and Mrs. Kelly were born six children: Edith M., was born October 14, 1876, and died December 11, 1896. May F., born October 22, 1878, married Robert J. Grant, and one son, Verner P., was born to them, December 16, 1900. Her husband died and later she married John C. Warner. Edna L., born July 30, 1880, married E. W. Odbert, and they have two children, Eugene W., Jr., born September 26, 1906, and Ralph K., born November 29, 1908. Ansel Ralph Kelly was born May 15, 1883, Cyrus M. Kelly was born July 26, 1886, and Lilly M. Kelly was born October 7, 1891. After his term in the legislature expired, Mr. Kelly returned to Eureka township where he remained until his death, October 12, 1908.<br>
His wife is still living, and as is befitting the daughter of an honored pioneer, takes a deep interest in the progress of the township, county and state.<br>

John Bernard KELLY
<p>
<a name ="I011824"><b>[I011824]</b></a><br />
Jack Bernard Kelly was the son of Cyrus Martin Kelly and Rose Ann Glancy. He was born in Washington, D. C. but in the early 1920's they moved to Atlanta, Georgia. Kelly received his grammar school education there and lived in the area until World War II began.<br>
Kelly enlisted on January 30, 1942 and attended boot camp at Parris Island. After graduation he was assigned to the First Marine Division deployed to New Zealand for further training. Throughout 1942, the primary objective of the First Marine Division was to take the fight to the Japanese. So shortly after their arrival at Wellington, the word was passed that they would soon be departing for the war zone. The Intelligence Section was concentrating on a small island in the Solomon Islands named Guadalcanal - it was chosen as their first target.<br>
<br>
The landing on Guadalcanal went unopposed. The Japanese waited in the jungle for the coming battle with the Marines. The Intelligence Section set about gathering and analyzing information they gleaned from the area. On August 12th, a Marine patrol from the 3rd Battalion, 5th Marine Regiment, captured a Japanese soldier named Sakado, found in their area. The Marines learned that the Japanese west of the Matanikau River were a disorganized and demoralized group, short on food and in poor health. They could, Sakado thought, be induced to surrender given the proper conditions.<br>
<br>
The commander of the Intelligence Section, Colonel Frank Bryan Goettge, had been annoyed by the rush job that intelligence had been forced into in New Zealand and the now apparent shortcomings in maps and other data were becoming more evident. Sakado was a godsend. Col. Goettge sent First Sergeant Steven Custer to organize a patrol, which Goettge himself would head. They would take an interpreter, a doctor, a good portion of the intelligence section and some riflemen for support, and boat across to a secluded beach where a white flag had reportedly been seen. They would convince the Japanese there to surrender and work their way back to Headquarters the next day, with Goettge presumably at the head of a cluster of happily surrendered Japanese.<br>
<br>
The patrol, consisting of 25 men plus Sakado (who was led by a rope around his neck by Platoon Sergeant Denzil Ray Caltrider) out from the camp at Kukum at about 1800 hours - a twelve hour delay caused by numerous personnel changes. The men were traveling light, carrying enough food for one day, a canteen, a poncho, and only light weapons.<br>
Due to tidal issues, the delay caused another problem - it was now too late to risk heading for the original landing site. Ignoring the warnings of Lieutenant Colonel Bill Whaling and the cries of Sakado, who begged them not to land there, the boat turned for shore and landed about 200 yards west of the Matanikau. The boat ran up on a sandbar, forcing the Marines to jump over the gun-whales and rock it free, creating quite a racket. They waded in to shore and, taking cover behind a line of banyan trees, held a quick council of war. All the noise they had made and now this pause gave the Japanese soldiers of the 2nd Platoon, 11th CU Security Force under Lt. Soichi Shindo, plenty of time to pick their targets. As Col. Goettge led an advance party into the treeline, two shots rang out. Col. Goettge fell dead with a shot to the head. The seriously wounded 1stSgt Custer dropped beside him. Two Marines who crawled forward to check on the men recovered Goettge's insignia and wristwatch. Command passed to Captain Wilfred Ringer. As more Marines dropped, killed or wounded, Cpt. Ringer called sent one of the men to get help from the base camp (he was killed a few hundred yards away). The remaining Marines formed a defensive perimeter on the beach, and over the course of the night and following morning were gradually picked off by the Japanese defenders. By dawn, the patrol had been wiped out aside from three survivors who managed to swim back to friendly lines one at a time. They reported seeing Japanese swords "flashing in the sun" as they fell upon the wounded and dead.<br>
The bodies of the Goettge Patrol were never recovered. There were accounts of knowing where they were and that they had been thrown into fighting trenches and covered up. There were at least three reports over the following weeks after the fight that the bodies were partially buried in the sand with limbs sticking out of the makeshift graves. One report, made by a Marine years later stated he was on patrol at the scene of the slaughter and personally saw the mutilated bodies of Goettge's patrol to include decapitated torsos and boots with limbs still attached. But no bodies were ever recovered.<br>
Several attempts over the past 65 years to locate the burial site of the Goettge Patrol have found nothing. It is suspected now that building in the general area and the change of the shoreline has resulted in the patrol's remains never being recovered. To this day, Kelly lies with his fellow Marines in a grave lost to time.<br>

HEART ATTACK CLAIMS LONGTIME CIVIC ACTIVIST NEIL KELLY<br>
Summary: The head of a remodeling company, he had worked tirelessly to help inner-North and Northeast Portland and other causes<br>
Neil Kelly , one of Portland's most active civic servants and successful businessmen, died of a heart attack Thursday at his Rockaway beach house. He was 80.<br>
Kelly founded Neil Kelly Designers/Remodelers, a business he bought for $100 and developed into one of the largest remodeling companies in the nation. '' Neil Kelly kitchens'' became a real estate status symbol, but Kelly remained committed to those with less. He personally served Meals on Wheels for 22 years and remained a champion of low-income neighborhoods in North and Northeast Portland.<br>
''He was always on the front line, helping people,'' said former Mayor Bud Clark, who appointed Kelly to the Portland Development Commission in 1985 and later taught him to pole a canoe. ''He was a gentle, loving and compassionate person.''<br>
Neil Benedict Kelly was born Oct. 6, 1914, in San Francisco Township in Carver County, Minn., the descendant of Irish immigrants who escaped the potato famine of the 1840s. The Kellys were a farming family until the Depression forced them into the town of Shakopee in 1928. Kelly 's father became a police officer whose work was devoted almost entirely to helping homeless people.<br>
Kelly attended high school in Shakopee and later moved to New Orleans. He worked on Grand Coulee Dam in 1935 and then in the Portland shipyards during World War II.<br>
He married Arlene Weaver in Caldwell, Idaho, on Dec. 24, 1940. In May 1942, the couple moved to Portland and stayed.<br>
In the early 1950s, Kelly bought Northwest Weather Proofing for $100. A few years later he changed the business name to Neil Kelly Company. At the time, most remodelers were ''suede-shoe types,'' Kelly said in an interview several years ago. ''At the PTA meeting, I'd never say I was a remodeler.''<br>
The company went from a one-man operation headquartered in Kelly 's home to the largest remodeling company in Portland, with 100 employees, and later among the largest in the United States. Seeking to raise standards in the industry, Kelly founded the Oregon Remodelers Association in 1969 and became its first president. He was twice president of the National Association of Remodelers.<br>
The Oregon State University Family Business program named the business Oregon Family Businesses of the Year in 1993 for ''maintaining a successful mix of community concern, business growth, industry involvement and encouragement of employees' professional and personal growth.''<br>
In recent years, Kelly turned the business over to his son, Tom, but still went into the office almost every day and was chairman at the time of his death.<br>
City Commissioner Gretchen Kafoury said Kelly ''didn't just retire. He stayed involved. He was there on any program where we needed him.''<br>
Kafoury said Kelly called her just a few weeks ago to ask her to speak to the Albina Rotary Club, which he also helped found.<br>
''He was such a dear, sweet person,'' she said. ''It's a huge loss to the community.''<br>
The patriarch of one of Portland's most political and civic-spirited families, Kelly was always active, sometimes as a quiet volunteer at St. Andrew Roman Catholic Church, where he was a member, sometimes needling public officials to find their consciences.<br>
When Albina businesses were looted and burned in racial unrest during the late 1960s, many businesses moved out. Kelly refused. He left his windows unboarded and worked to help the neighborhood. Two decades later, as a member of the downtown-oriented Portland Development Commission, he urged the Portland City Council to pay more attention to North and Northeast neighborhoods.<br>
Over the years, he was appointed to the Portland Mayor's Future Focus Policy Group, the Governor's State Housing Council and the Multnomah County Community Corrections Committee.<br>
Kelly won many awards, including the George Russill Award for exceptional volunteer public service. In his honor, the North/Northeast Business Boosters give an annual Neil Kelly award for exemplary business and community service.<br>
But he still found time for sailing, participating in nine international races. In 1984, his boat, Wizard, set a record in the Oregon offshore 200-mile race from Astoria to Victoria, British Columbia.<br>
A vigil service for Kelly will be at 7 p.m. Sunday at St. Andrew Church. Mass will be at 10:30 a.m. Monday at St. Andrew. Burial will be in Gethsemani Cemetery in Portland.<br>
Kelly is survived by his wife; daughters, Mary Paige of San Francisco, Anne Kelly Feeney, Susan Des Camp and Jane Olberding, all of Portland; sons, Neil V. of Valdez, Alaska, and Thomas, John C. and James O., all of Portland; sisters, Mary T. Ryan of Sherwood, Margaret R. and Clare, both of Portland, Sister Ann Shirley, O.L.V.K., of Huntington, Ind., Constance Manning of Portland and Rose Scherzinger of Beaverton; 19 grandchildren; and three great-grandchilren.<br>
The family suggests that remembrances be contributions to the St. Andrew/Ecumenical Ministries summer day camp.<br>
