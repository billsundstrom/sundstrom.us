Francis RUSSELL
<p>
<a name ="I005986"><b>[I005986]</b></a><br />
Francis Russell, 2nd Earl of Bedford, KG (c. 1527 - 28 July 1585) was an English nobleman, soldier and politician.<br>
He was educated at King's Hall, Cambridge and accompanied his father, John Russell, 1st Earl of Bedford, to sit in the House of Commons. He assisted to quell the rising in Devonshire in 1549, and after his father had been created Earl of Bedford in January 1550, was known as Lord Russell, taking his seat in the House of Lords under this title in 1552.<br>
<br>
Russell was in sympathy with the reformers, whose opinions he shared, and was in communication with Sir Thomas Wyatt; and in consequence of his religious attitude was imprisoned during the earlier part of Mary's reign. Being released he visited Italy, came into touch with foreign reformers. He led the English contingent fighting for Philip II of Spain, then Englands King Consort, at the Battle of St. Quentin in 1557.<br>
[edit] Elizabeth<br>
<br>
When Elizabeth ascended the throne in November 1558 the Earl of Bedford, as Russell had been since 1555, became an active figure in public life. He was made a privy councillor, and was sent on diplomatic errands to Charles IX of France and Mary, Queen of Scots.<br>
<br>
From February 1564 to October 1567 he was governor of Berwick and warden of the east marches of Scotland, in which capacity he conducted various negotiations between Elizabeth and Mary. He appears to have been an efficient warden, but was irritated by the vacillating and tortuous conduct of the English queen. When the northern insurrection broke out in 1569, Bedford was sent into Wales, and he sat in judgment upon the Duke of Norfolk in 1572.<br>
In 1576 he was president of the council of Wales, and in 1581 was one of the commissioners deputed to arrange a marriage between Elizabeth and François, Duke of Anjou. Bedford, who was made a Knight of the Garter in 1564, appears to have been a generous and popular man, and died in London. He was buried at the family chapel next to Chenies Manor House, the family estate which he had made his principal home and where he had entertained Queen Elizabeth in 1570.<br>
His first wife was Margaret St John (Bletsoe, Bedfordshire, 1533 - 27 August 1562), daughter of Sir John St John (great-grandson of Margaret Beauchamp of Bletso) and Margaret Walgrave, by whom he had four sons and three daughters:<br>
    * Anne Russell (1548-1603), married Ambrose Dudley, 3rd Earl of Warwick<br>
    * Edward Russell, Baron Russell (1551-1572), married Jane Sybilla Morrison of Cashiobury, without issue<br>
    * John Russell, Baron Russell (c.1553-1584), married Elizabeth Cooke, one daughter<br>
    * Francis Russell, Baron Russell (c.1554 - 27 July 1585), married Juliana Foster and had issue, including Edward Russell, 3rd Earl of Bedford, and Mary Ann Russell, wife of John Roote, and had issue<br>
    * William Russell, 1st Baron Russell of Thornhaugh (c.1557-1613)<br>
    * Elizabeth Russell (d. 1605), married William Bourchier, 3rd Earl of Bath<br>
    * Margaret Russell (1560-1616), married George Clifford, 3rd Earl of Cumberland.<br>
<br>
His second wife was Bridget (d. 1601), daughter of John Hussey, 1st Baron Hussey of Sleaford, twice widowed. He was succeeded as third Earl by his grandson, Edward (1572-1627), only son of Francis, Lord Russell (c. 1550-1585).<br>

John RUSSELL
<p>
<a name ="I006426"><b>[I006426]</b></a><br />
John Russell, 1st Earl of Bedford, KG, PC, JP (c. 1485 - 14 March 1554/1555) was an English royal minister in the Tudor  era. He served variously as Lord High Admiral and Lord Privy Seal.<br>
Among lands and property he was given by Henry VIII after the Dissolution of the Monasteries, were the Abbey and town of Tavistock, and the area that is now Covent Garden.<br>
Russell is the ancestor of all subsequent Earls and Dukes of Bedford and Earls Russell, including John Russell, Prime Minister of the United Kingdom and philosopher Bertrand Russell.<br>
John Russell was born c.1485 probably at Berwick-by-Swyre, Dorset, the son James Russell(d. November 1505)[2]  and his 1st wife Alice Wise, da. of Thomas Wise of Sidenham, near Tavistock, Devon.[3]  James's father was possibly William Russell, but more likely his brother John Russell(d.1505) by his wife Alice Froxmere, da. of John Froxmere of Droitwich, Worcs.[4]  John was the son of Henry Russell(d.1463/4), and Elizabeth Herring, da. of John Herring of Chaldon Herring. Henry, great-grandfather of the 1st Earl, was a substantial wine merchant and shipper, who represented Weymouth in the House of Commons 4 times.[5]  The Russell pedigree can only be traced back with certainty to Henry Russell's father, Stephen Russell, the evidence being contained in a deed of April 1440 [6]  in which Henry Russell made over to his daughter Cristina and her husband Walter Cheverell of Chauntemarle, a tenement in Dorchester to be held of himself and his heirs upon rent of a red rose. In the deed Henry referred to himself as son and heir of Stephen Russell and of Alice his wife.[7]  This Alice appears to have been the heir general of the De la Tour family,[8]  which had long owned Berwick-by-Swyre, and by whom therefore the manor was brought into the Russell family. Both Henry and Stephen were referred to as Gascoigne as well as Russell, possibly due to their wine trade with France, as in a 1442 pardon under the Privy Seal referring to Henry Russell of Weymouth, merchant, alias Henry Gascoign, gentleman.[9]  It was long believed in the noble Russell family, certainly by the 2nd Earl of Bedford, that the family was descended from the ancient family of Russell of Kingston Russell in Dorset, 3 miles NE of Berwick, which descent was declared unproven by Gladys Scott Thomson, FRHist.Soc., in her Two Centuries of Family History, London (1930), an exhaustive and scholarly work on the early pedigree of the Earls of Bedford. For a disambiguation of the Bedford Russells and the Russells of Kingston Russell, see Kingston Russell.<br>
In 1506 John Russell was of service to Philip of Austria and Juana his wife (King and Queen of Castile) when they were shipwrecked off Weymouth, and was introduced to the Court by them. He became Gentleman of the Privy Chamber to Henry VII in 1507 and Henry VIII in 1509, who employed him in various military and diplomatic missions during the War of the League of Cambrai. He was at the taking of Thérouanne  and Tournai. He was knighted on 2 July 1522 after losing an eye at the taking of Morlaix in Brittany, and he witnessed the Battle of Pavia.<br>
In the spring of 1526, he married Anne Sapcote, widow of John Broughton and of Sir Richard Jerningham, and daughter of Sir Guy Sapcote and his wife Margaret Wolston, and made alterations to Chenies Manor House to reflect his new good fortunes. He now stood in favor with the King and Cardinal Wolsey, though he would not suffer disgrace at the fall of the latter.<br>
He was made Sheriff of Dorset and Somerset in 1528 and served as Member of Parliament for Buckinghamshire 1529-1536, retaining the royal favor despite the antipathy of Anne Boleyn. Late in 1536, he was made a Privy Counsellor, and helped to suppress the Pilgrimage of Grace.<br>
The fall and execution of the Marquess of Exeter left a vacuum of power in the southwestern counties of England, which Russell would be called upon to fill. On 9 March 1538/1539 he was created Baron Russell, and appointed Lord President of the Council of the West. In the next month, he was made a Knight of the Garter. In July 1539 he was made High Steward of Cornwall, and Lord Warden of the Stannaries.<br>
The Council of the West proved unsuccessful as an instrument of government, and did not survive the fall of Cromwell. Russell, however, remained a great magnate in the western counties, and obtained the office of Lord High Admiral in 1540. (The previous holder, the Earl of Southampton, replaced Cromwell as Lord Privy Seal.) After Henry VIII met Anne of Cleves at Rochester, the next day he asked Russell if he thought her fair? Russell replied he took her not to be fair, but of a brown complexion.[11] In 1542, Russell himself resigned the Admiralty and succeeded to the Privy Seal on the death of Southampton. He was High Steward of the University of Oxford from 1543 till his death.<br>
During the Italian War of 1542, he unsuccessfully besieged Montreuil in 1544, and was Captain General of the Vanguard of the army for the attack on Boulogne in 1545. He was a close companion of Henry VIII during the last years of his reign. On Henry's death, he was one of the executors of the King's will, and one of sixteen counsellors during the minority of Edward VI.<br>
On 16 June 1553 he was one of the twenty-six Peers who signed the settlement of the crown on Lady Jane Grey. He was sent to attend Philip II into England on his coming from Spain to wed the Queen.<br>
He died 14 March 1554/1555 and was buried at Chenies, Buckinghamshire, in the private Bedford Chapel of the church next to his manor there.<br>
Russell is the ancestor of all subsequent Earls and Dukes of Bedford and Earls Russell, including John Russell, Prime Minister of the United Kingdom and philosopher Bertrand Russell.<br>
On the dissolution of the greater monasteries Henry VIII granted him lands and properties including the Cistercian Abbey at Dunkeswell, Devon, the Abbey of Tavistock, Devon, and the town of Tavistock. He was also granted seven acres (28,000 m2) called "Long Acre", and the kitchen garden of Westminster Abbey, which is now the site of "Covent Garden".[1]  He was Lord High Steward for Edward's coronation 20 February 1547. He was created Earl of Bedford on 19 January 1549/1550 for his assistance in carrying out the order of the Council against "images" and for promoting the new religion. In 1552, he was made Lord Lieutenant of Devon.<br>

John Russell died on Apr. 7, 1989, at Columbia Hospital, in Milwaukee. He was educated at the Milwaukee Country Day School. At Princeton, he majored in politics, was active in musical clubs, was a member of Dial Lodge, and roomed all four years with his older brother and classmate, Copeland, who died in 1981. Bud attended Harvard Law School for two years prior to entering the insurance business in Milwaukee. He spent his entire career with the George H. Russell Co., the John A. Russell Co., and the Thorning-Gorman Agency. He retired in 1979.<br>
Bud was active in business and real estate, and as a resident of the suburban area of Shorewood, he succeeded in preventing high-rise apartments from being built along the lakefront. He was a charter member and governor of the Wisconsin chapter of the Mayflower Society. He won the state amateur golf championship when he was 19, and he maintained his interest in golf, as well as in tennis and squash. He and his family enjoyed vacations in Canada. He was a faithful member of the Roman Catholic Church.<br>
Bud married Agnes Clare Milne on Apr. 23, 1942. They had four children: Mary Carroll, John Jr., Baxter (who died at the age of 22 in a mountain-climbing accident), and Richard C. Bud remained a loyal Princetonian throughout his life and was active in the local Princeton club. We remember him as a fine gentleman and faithful friend, and our sympathy is with Agnes and the family.<br>

John Stephen RUSSELL
<p>
<a name ="I075791"><b>[I075791]</b></a><br />
John Stephen Russell was born February 18, 1955 in Joplin, Missouri, to Ruth Hamm. He was raised primarily by his grandmother, Edith Hamm, and they shared a close bond. He had many childhood friends and often spoke fondly of playing games and pranks with neighborhood friends, such as fooling passersby with a fake wallet. <br>
He threw newspapers as a boy and often spoke of being able to throw long shots, sometimes landing at customers' feet inside the home. He attended Parkwood High School and enjoyed working at a go-cart track as a teen.<br>
After high school, he began a long career at Eagle Picher, where he did facility maintenance along with various other positions and acted as a Union Steward. He loved fast cars, for which Sherri jokingly called him "AJ Foyt," and he enjoyed owning and working on several classic cars in his teens and early twenties.<br>
John met Sherri Hulette in 1974 through mutual friends and immediately knew that he had found the person that he wanted to marry. They were married in 1974 after only three months of dating. The couple narrowly survived a train wreck early in their marriage. He formed tight friendships with his mother-in-law, Leona "Babe" Hulette, and several brothers and sisters-in-law: <br>
He was an avid fisherman and especially enjoyed fishing with his brother-in-law. He enjoyed spending time with many nieces and nephews: as well as their children.<br>
Sherri and John soon bought a house in Joplin and two years later Sherri gave birth to a daughter in 1977. He was a playful father and loved giving horsey rides and playing board games with the family. John was a prankster, and he often played tricks on his family and friends, such as creating a stuffed, fully clothed clone of himself to fool his daughter, driving a motorcycle around the neighborhood as fast as possible to the chagrin of Sherri, and creating comical answering machine messages with the family.<br>
He began working at International Paper where he worked on telephone poles in the late 80s and stayed there for many years before going to LaBarge in the 2000s, from which he retired. He spoke fondly of many coworkers he had befriended over the years. John enjoyed weekend trips, watching boxing, and his favorite pasttime--watching Nascar.<br>
He enjoyed attending car shows and in his later years owned two Corvettes which (along with his faithful pup, Maggie May) were his pride and joy. He was active in a Corvette club and found many friends in this. In 2005, he met the second love of his life--his granddaughter. He adored spending time with her, having tea parties and seeing her nearly every day for many years. He also found a friendship in his son-in-law, whom he called "his son."<br>
John had a sharp wit, even in difficult times. He was always cracking jokes or one-liners with his friends or family and was even known as "David Letterman" due to his sense of humor. He played softball in his younger years and had quite the left arm. He loved music, especially rock n' roll, and John and Sherri attended many concerts over the years. He loved Christmas, and would spend hours on the roof creating an enormous display of lights and decorations for his home, for which he earned the nickname "Griswold" by Sherri. He truly cherished holidays and tradition, rising early to open presents, and having family around on these occasions.<br>
John affected all who knew him, and his playful spirit will be missed.<br>
Graveside services for John are 1:00 p.m. Wednesday, January 3, 2018, at Mount Hope Cemetery in Webb City. The family will receive friends for visitation from 6:00 - 8:00 p.m. Tuesday in the chapel of Thornhill-Dillon Mortuary in Joplin.<br>
Arrangements are under the personal care and direction of Thornhill-Dillon Mortuary, Joplin, Missouri.<br>
