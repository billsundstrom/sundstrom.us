Linked To Divorce Suit <br>
AUBURN, Cal., July 10. (API) An asserted romance in an isolated mining district today brought the name of Mrs. Ellemerie Morgan, mine superintendent and former Follies dancer, into a divorce-suit as correspondent. The suit was filed, against Claire M. Storey, one of twenty-two men employed at the mine, by Mrs. Clara Storey, whose attorney said he wilt "drag" the entire camp into the case if necessary. "If they want to air the proposition," said Attorney W. H. Slade, who filed the complaint, "we'll drag the whole of Forest Hills into it." Mrs. Morgan, whose career from Broadway chorus to mining forms a romantic background, is superintendent of the Three Queens gold quartz mine at Forest Hills.  Mrs. Storey charged that her husband has transferred his affections to Mrs. Morgan, who acquaintances said danced in the Ziegfeld follies in 1912 and 1914, under the name of Ellemerie Scott. Workers at the former dancer's mine, where a rich strike was recently reported, said she is in Crass Valley, but she could not be located there today. She also has mining interests in Montana and frequently makes airplane trips to that state. Mrs. Morgan's present husband, who Slade Hid was her second, is Joseph Morgan, employed at Eldorado County mine. They have two children. She is engaged in the mining venture in partnership with J. T. Boyd, Placerville, Calif., consulting engineer of the Consolidated Mines of South Africa. Forest Hills is twenty miles up a Sierra gulch from here.<br>

<p>
<a name ="I011361"><b>[I011361]</b></a><br />
From what seems to have been ptomaine poisoning, Alice Brinker, aged fifteen, died suddenly in the arms of her mother, Mrs. Hannah A. Brinker, at their apartment over W.E. Slawson's livery stable on East Milwaukee street about two o'clock this afternoon. The girl was taken sick with dizziness while at the Adams school yesterday and was brought home by her sister Mildred. In the afternoon she had violent fits of vomiting and when her mother returned from work in the evening patent medicines were administered. This morning Dr. Charles Sutherland, physician for the poor, was called, but medical treatment failed. This afternoon he stated that the sickness was probably ptomaine poisoning, though it might possibly have been cholera morbus. Death as hastened by the fact that the rooms were the family live are not heated and the girl was allowed to drink nearly a quart of ice water during the night. Only a post-mortum examination will positively establish the cause of death. The deceased is survived by a mother, two sisters, Mildred and May, and a brother, Dewey.<br>

Beulah Mae BRINKER
<p>
<a name ="I011690"><b>[I011690]</b></a><br />
Graveside services for Beulah M. Olson, 94, Niagara Falls, NY, were held on Tuesday, June 2, in the family plot at the Riverview Cemetery in Chamberlain.<br>
Beulah Mae Brinker Olson, a beloved Christian mother, a teacher, an artist, a puppeteer, a family genealogist and a perennial gardener, passed away quietly, May 14, 2015, at the Schoellkopf Nursing Centre in Niagara Falls, NY, at the age of 94. She was born on the farm in Pukwana, S.D., to Dewey Labitt Brinker and Nan Adelia Gearhart Brinker, on March 31, 1922, the first of two children.<br>
Beulah lived an amazing life: spent her early childhood being raised on a farm that was part of the extended Gearhart family farms. Like many others in this area, she survived the worst of the Depression and the "Dirty Thirties", where the grasshopperʼs ate the paint off their house and their buildings, and everything they planted but turnips. The dirt was so fine that it infiltrated around the window and door frames of their home. With the determination and faith of her parents, their sense of humour and good fun, she became a woman of deep faith and substance. Beulah had always loved theatre, singing, dancing and music. Her mother taught her to love gardening and all of Godʼs creation. She was talented in art of all kinds: drawing, painting with oils, sewing, embroidery, sculpting. Later she made puppets, dolls, and teddy bears. She was a voracious reader and a loyal friend.<br>
Beulah attended the Gearhart School where she always had an auntie as a teacher. She then attended the Pukwana High School, graduating in 1938. She took part in the activities of the Civilian Conservation Corps during the Depression. Beulah attended Dakota Wesleyan University, in Mitchell, as her mother had before her, and got a Normal diploma for teaching. She taught at one-room country schools south of Chamberlain until the end of the Second World War. Beulah married Fred C. Olson, a neighbor, when he returned from the war. They eloped to Omaha, Neb., where Fredʼs sister Elsie, and her husband, Edwin Worthing were their witnesses. From there, they made their way to Southern California, where they lived in Culver City, for two years. They returned to South Dakota, living in Rapid City where Fred worked at a printing company and attended business school. When he graduated, they moved to Chamberlain, where Fred had attended high school. He worked for the local newspaper and printing company. Their first child, Nanda Louise, was born while they lived in Chamberlain.<br>
Beulah was active in the local church and was a leader with the Cub Scouts. She began to plan and execute beautiful perennial gardens in their first home along the river, then their house by the hospital. They moved to Mitchell in 1957, finally planting roots on Wisconsin Street, where they built a home. Tamara was born in 1958. Beulah and Fred where very active in the First Methodist Church there, teaching Grade 2 Sunday School with another couple for 18 years. She was also a supervising teacher, helping to train new teachers, a member of Christian Education, the Womenʼs Association and a number of other committees. She was also a member of numerous clubs and was an adult leader for the "Candy Striperʼs (Red Cross Volunteens)." Beulah took courses here and there at DWU in painting and in philosophy as a special student.<br>
In 1967, Beulah returned to DWU to finish her Bachelorʼs Degree, then went on to receive a Masterʼs in Education from Augustana College in Sioux Falls, S.D., in 1972. Beulah taught at the Ethan Public School as their Special Education Teacher from 1972-75. Having a better opportunity in Iowa to support her children, Beulah moved to Waverly, Iowa, to begin a career in 1975 as an Educational Strategist for Area Education Agency #7 in Waterloo, Iowa. She worked as an educational diagnostician, testing children with learning difficulties and writing educational prescriptions to be followed in the classroom. Beulah worked for the Agency until her retirement in 1985.<br>
When her daughters, Nan (teacher) and Tamara (clergy) moved to Connecticut to study puppetry at the Eugene OʼNeill Theatre Centre, Beulah went with them and became the director of "Kidʼs Place," an after school program in one of the elementary schools in Norwich, Conn. The next year, they returned to Iowa. Beulah returned to her home in Waverly, where she found great pleasure in: working in her gardens, attending a local womenʼs bible study with friends, activities for the Sons of Norway, the Daughterʼs of the American Revolution, the First United Methodist Church and the Puppeteerʼs of America.<br>
When Beulahʼs oldest daughter began to have health difficulties in 1987, she brought Nan into her home, where she took care of her from 1987- 2007. In 2007 Tamara moved them both to Youngstown, NY, where she and her family could help. Beulah was especially pleased to be in the Youngstown and Lewiston area, as one of her ancestors had been the daughter of a Hotchkiss in Lewiston, New York in the early 1800ʼs. She determinedly took care of Nan by herself until 2009 when aids were hired to assist her. In mid-2013, Beulah experienced a medical emergency and then needed nursing care herself. Though her health continued to decline, she lived comfortably at Schoellkopf, close to her daughters and family, until her death.<br>
Beulah is survived by daughters, Nanda L Gearhart and Tamara L Olson (Graeme Jannaway), grand daughter, Hannah, step-grandson, Andrew, sister-in-law, Edweena Brinker, nephews, Harry Brinker (Linda) and Rick Brinker(Karen).<br>
She was predeceased by her parents, Dewey and Nan Brinker and her brother, David Brinker.<br>

The Saint Peter Woolen Mill is a family-owned and operated woolen mill. It is located in the beautiful Minnesota River Valley, where it continues on to a fourth generation.<br>
In 1912, John Charles and Margaret Brinker purchased the Saint Peter Woolen Mill buildings and machinery from Edward Borneman. John Charles and his son John Henry continued in business together until John Charles Brinker's death in 1931. Charles Henry then inherited the Mill and continued in business along with his wife, Evelyn. In 1954, their son Charles Eugene Brinker and his wife Mary Lue purchased the Saint Peter Woolen Mill.<br>
The original Woolen Mill building, too old for safety, was torn down in 1960 and the machinery was moved to its present location adjacent to where the old Mill stood.<br>
Today, Charles E. Brinker's daughter Patricia Johnson continues to manage the Mill operations for a fourth generation. His son, Joel Brinker, is Sales Manager for the Mill. Another daughter, Peggy Brinker, manages Mary Lue's Yarn Shop and the Sheep Delights gift shop. The tradition of the Saint Peter Woolen Mill continues in the Brinker family.<br>

Police say Brinker allegedly wrapped the female in a blanket and asphyxiated the female by placing a sock in her mouth, tying a cloth belt across her face, placing the woman on a mattress and leaving her in that state for a significant period of time, which then lead to her death.<br>
Brinker allegedly then brought the victimʼs children to the crime scene and convinced one of the children to call 911. Brinker was not at the residence when responding officers arrived and was later located at another residence in Mitchell.<br>
Police say there was a valid protection order in place that prohibited James from having contact with the victim at the time of the incident.<br>
The investigation is ongoing.<br>

John Charles BRINKER
<p>
<a name ="I001335"><b>[I001335]</b></a><br />
From the 1870 Census from White  Hempfield, Westmoreland, PA:<br>
John C Brinker, age 7 (b.1862) in PA; head of houshold Samuel (abt 1826) and Almira (abt 1841) Brinker with siblings of James M. (abt 1858) and Calvin R. (abt 1860).  Research in Greensburg church records and the 1880 census showed that the family called themselves Bricker, a common variation of Brinker.  John is listed as 18 years old in the 1880 census.  I found baptismal records for all the childen except John.  <br>
<br>
1895 Iowa Census shows John C. Brinker, age 33 born in PA, in Van Buren, Kokuk County.<br>
<br>
Family stories from his first family imply that he may have run away from family at a very early age.<br>
Both families have other stories that he was an adopted orphan.  He was a bit deceptive about the facts around his background.<br>
It is said that there was detecive's report, paid for by wife one, that found he lived with a farm family on the Illinois side of the quad-city area at age 16.  He knew nothing about farming by was very adept at machinery repair.<br>
Stories of origins of his parents place them both in Northern Holland and Germany.<br>
His marriage license states that he was born in Canada.  Most of the time he reported his birthplace as Johnstown, PA.  This may have been another deception.<br>
A side note is that only one Brinker (Henry) was declared missing in the great Johnstown flood of 1889, when more than 2000 perished.<br>
His parents names came from the marriage license to Hannah Day and his death certificate with the informant being his son, Charles.<br>
Most of the family records that existed and had not been searched were destroyed in the 1998 tornado at St. Peter, MN. <br>
<br>
A story from Elinor and Vernon Sundstrom, says that Mary Brinker stopped to visit an aunt, the child of John Brinker, around Wessington Springs, SD, in September 1947.<br>
