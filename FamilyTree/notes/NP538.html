It is with heavy hearts that we announce the passing of Tim on August 5, 2018, 50 years young.<br>

Raised with his three siblings, Todd, Jane and Tina, he graduated from Kings County Academy in 1986 and then attended Acadia University where he obtained a Bachelor of Business Administration degree in 1990. Tim went on to meet the love of his life, Dianne, and they married in 2003. In 2005 they welcomed the apple of Timʼs eye, their daughter Samantha.

Always remembered for his quick wit and zest for life, Tim was a humble and giving man, who believed in the glass always being half full.

He was Samanthaʼs number one fan and was very proud of her accomplishments and the beautiful person that she is. Tim always took the time to build long-lasting relationships and was always up for anything, which meant a number of special trips to Nepal, Spain, England and Italy. Tim will also be missed by Brownie, the dog he never wanted but ended up loving dearly.<br>
