Answers The Final Summons.<br>
Hans Heglin, Clay County Pioneer, Passes Away on Thursday of Last Week.<br>
<br>
     Hans Heglin was born in Hogbo Parish, Sweden, August 19, 1826, and died at the home of his son, Fred Heglin, at Dalesburg, S.D. August 17, 1916, lacking just two days of being ninety years old.<br>
<br>
     He was united in marriage to Brita Anderson in 1851, out of which union were born three sons and one daughter, namely John, Peter, and Frederick.  The daughter died in early infancy.  His wife died about three years ago.  John and Peter are residents of Saskatchewan, Canada, while Fred resides on the old homestead in Clay, S.D.  He is survived by a large number of grand and great grandchildren.  He emigrated from Sweden in 1869 and was destined for Galva, Illinois, but through some mistake was landed at Omaha instead, where he procured work the next day.  In this place he resided but a short time, moving to Council Bluffs where he remained until the fall of 1870 when he removed with his family to Dakota Territory.  At Sioux City he purchased an Ox team and finished the journey by means of the same.  He homesteaded in this country near Dalesburg which remained his home until the time of his death.<br>
<br>
     Grandpa Heglin, as he was familiarly known was a unique character. He was short of stature, but heavy set and had the power and endurance that was exceptional.  As a matter of interest it may be well to relate that during the early grasshopper times when want and penury knocked at every door in the land, he bade his wife goodbye and children goodbye and with knapsack on his shoulder and 50 cents in his pocket started for Omaha afoot, covering the entire distance during that day and night or in something less than twenty-four hours.  At the end of his journey he threw himself on the grass for a couple of hours of  refreshing sleep and waking, grasped the first job at hand and went to work the following day.  His habit of hard work continued through life and it was his delight to have one of the best cultivated gardens in the, even during his advanced years.  But he was as patient as he was enduring and this undoubtedly aided his tense vitality, for though at times afflicted by such distressing ills, such as quinsy, rheumatism and dropsy, and when others thought there was little hope he would rally and recover apparently coming out from the same a healthier and stronger man, and this was due perhaps to his sunny, hopeful disposition, for he was every whit an optimist.<br>
<br>
     To the very last he could read a newspaper without glasses and his head did not contain a single gray hair.  But his optimism did not confine itself to his own personality.  It was contagious and extended to the whole community.  In those dark days when hope was well nigh and gone many said, "We cannot endure this longer," Grandpa Heglin would answer, "Yes, this may be bad, but it is so much better than the old country." Through this spirit of optimism he had a good word for everybody, whether present or absent.  Then he had the spirit of charity and no no one called for aid that did not receive it cheerfully.  The lowliest tramp would not leave his door hungry.  He was a lover of music and undoubtedly transmitted this quality to his children, some who have become very proficient in the same.  Even at the close of his career he delighted to sing for his freinds the hymns of his native land.  He was simple-hearted, faithful member of the Lutheran church at Dalesburg, having united with it at its organization in 1872.<br>
<br>
     There comes to us with ever increasing force the thought that life is transitory; that the place that once knew us shall no us no more.  The old familiar faces that we once looked upon with tender interest, are now but vague images on memory's wall.  It is safe to say so far as Dalesburg is concerned that Grandpa Heglin was the last ripened sheaf to be garnered from the field; last of the elder ones who came here in the prime of his life.  May we not appropriately put the words of the post on the lips of the Master and hear him say as he applies it to human life.<br>
<br>
"I'll not leave thee thou lone one,<br>
To pine on the stem,<br>
Since the lovely are sleeping,<br>
Go sleep thou with them.<br>
Thus kindly I'll scatter,<br>
Thy leaves o'er the bed,<br>
Where thy mates of the garden,<br>
Lie scattered and dead."<br>
<br>
     It had been planned , and invitations sent out by those who tenderly and lovingly cared for this worthy father and citizen that they should appropriately celebrate his ninetieth anniversary, but the Master of Life thought otherwise.  Suddenly, from usual health, he grew ill on Tuesday at 6 p.m., and died Thursday at 4 p.m., thus became Saturday his ninetieth anniversary a day of sorrow and tears and loneliness to his loved ones and tender and tearful memory to all that Knew him.  His ashes were at the hands of  Pastor Ford, consigned to Mother Earth and he sleeps along side his beloved wife in the cemetery on the hill, awaiting the summons of the Lord of Life and Glory. Sleep in peace, neighbor, freind, sleep in peace.<br>
