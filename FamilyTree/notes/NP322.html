<p>
<a name ="I055369"><b>[I055369]</b></a><br />
July 12, 1918 - March 11, 2004<br>
Lena Walberg passed on peacefully in her sleep in hospital early morning March 11th, 2004 at the age of 85. She worked hard on her family's market garden farm in her earlier years. When she married her devoted husband Lloyd Walberg, she prepared coffee and pastries everyday for Lloyd and customers who happened to be shopping in their Walberg's grocery store on Brock St. She loved to spend summers at Wild Goose, picking berries, making pies, and spending time with many relatives who came from out of town to visit the camp. Golf was another of her passions and she, Lloyd and her friends spent many enjoyable outings at the Fort William Country Club. Lena was very active in First Church United activities. Her last few years were spent living quite independently at Jasper Place with the wonderful caring support of her staff. She looked forward to visits from her friends and family. Mom was never happier than when she was surrounded by all her family, the most recent being two great grandchildren Brett and Evan Maslack. Left with many fond memories of her humourous personality (just like her mom) are three daughters Karen Papson (Dave) on route from Vancouver and her sons Barry Tabor (Lesya and Maryanne), son Darren Maslack en route from Vancouver and Michael Maslack (Tara) and sons Brett and Evan Maslack, Barbara Walberg (Bill Walker) and daughters Kesia and Erin and Joan Halonen and her daughter Seija (en route from Vancouver). Numerous other relatives also survive who have supported her in these last years. Thank you to Nadiera and family who treated her lovingly like an adopted grandmother and Jean Cathers, a faithful Saturday lunch visitor who brought her much joy with her regular visits. She was predeceased by her loving husband Lloyd, mother, father, brothers, a sister and other relatives. Cremation has taken place and a memorial service celebrating Lena's life will be held at First Church Untied on Monday, March 22nd, at 12:00 noon followed by a luncheon in the church basement. Private family interment of ashes will be held at a later date. Donations to the St. Joseph's Care Group would be appreciated, as these compassionate people were so helpful to our mother during the last few years. Thank you to everyone for all your support during this time. When I come to the end of the road And the sun has set for me I want no rites in a gloom filled room Why cry for a soul set free Miss me a little - but not too long and now with your head bowed low Remember the love that we once shared Miss Me - But Let Me Go For this is a journey we all must take And each must go alone It's all a part of the Master's Plan A step on the road to home When you are lonely and sick of heart Go to the friends we know And bury your sorrows in doing good deeds Miss Me - But Let Me Go<br>
