Maybelle Lance HAMMOND
<p>
<a name ="I075405"><b>[I075405]</b></a><br />
Maybelle Hammond lived her last years in a little house the color of railroad sleeping cars down in the valley of Phalen Creek in St. Paul, Minnesota. Every Saturday she would make her trip up into town to see the Wild West movies. Leaving early in the morning, she would sit all day watching and then return at dark. To do this she had to climb 103 steps up from the valley to get to Main Street. She was then in her nineties.<br>
She was often persuaded to move into a pretty little white house where she could be safer and more accessible in winter. She tried that awhile and then had everything moved back down to her little green house where she could keep a few chickens and hear the trains go by.<br>
She captivated people by stories of the olden days. Her face was fiercely animated; her eyes sometimes quiet as if seeing a vision, then flashing. It was about the ox cart ride to deadwood, South Dakota, the Mendota Minnesota massacre, the sounds of the Dakota prairie at night, and about her first husband, frank sears who had been the first mayor of Webster, South Dakota, and she his wife pictured in silks and satins and ostrich plumed hat.<br>
She had an old cigar store indian statue with painted green and red feathers, somewhat faded and dust laden in one corner of the little green house.<br>
Some said that she had been to too many Wild West shows. During world war 1 she got a job at the northern pacific railroad stripping the upholstery from Pullman cars. Afraid that they would not hire a woman her age she lied that she was 10 years younger. The lie backfired, since at retirement she had to work until she was 75 instead of 65 to collect her pension.<br>
She fell and broke her hip (age in the nineties). She was taken to the hospital, they put a pin in it, she said, and one day when no one was watching she got out of bed, left the hospital, and took the streetcar home.<br>
She used her railroad pass to go to Fargo, North Dakota to visit her daughters. Then take off to see her son and his wife in Virginia somewhere.<br>
She and her first husband Frank Sears probably left Illinois immediately after their wedding with the general exodus to the Deadwood gold rush.<br>
She used to claim that she had seen Abraham Lincoln.<br>
She divorced Frank Sears in 1901 and moved from South Dakota to St. Paul, Minnesota along with her four children. She died at age 93 from cancer.<br>
