Carole GIBSON
<p>
<a name ="I081920"><b>[I081920]</b></a><br />
Carole Gibson Champion, 74, of Fort Shaw, died of cancer Thursday, Jan. 19, in Great Falls. <br>
Croxford's Funeral Home is handling cremation arrangements, and Carole requested no formal services. <br>
The family suggests that people grieve in a way that works best for them.<br>
Carole was born to Verna and Lindsay Gibson on Sept. 29, 1937, in Great Falls. She was raised in Alameda, Sask. In her youth, Carole loved figure skating and animals. In 1954, she married Delbert Skow in Alameda, but later divorced in 1967. Then she met the love of her life, Donald Champion. She worked as a telephone operator, bartender, hospital worker and secretary, but her greatest love was being a homemaker. They enjoyed many years of wedded bliss until his death in 2000, and her ashes will join his per her request. Although Carole and Don never had children of their own, they welcomed several foster children into their home. <br>
Carole was blessed by a wonderful sense of humor, incredible cooking skills, a green thumb for gardening in even desert-like conditions and a deep love for her friends and family. One of her greatest joys was baking the world's best apple pies. Her last three weeks were spent reflecting on a lifetime of hilarious stories, spiritual grace and forgiveness. Her dear friend Toni Brewster stood by her side every step of this difficult journey. During this time, the family respected her request for privacy during her painful yet brave battle with metastasized cancer. <br>
Carole was a proud American who loved the American flag. She was also a member of the Montana Cowgirls Association, and she was a steadfast women's rights advocate. She walked through the valley of death with Jesus while surrounded by loved ones. <br>
She is survived by brother Rennie (Glenda) Gibson of Great Falls; brother Lyle (Dorothy) Gibson of Great Falls; sister-in-law Gail Gibson of Alameda; foster daughter Jeanette Thorne; and foster sons Robert and Edward Thorne; many beloved nieces and nephews; and great nieces and nephews. She was preceded in death by her parents; foster son Mike Ably; brother Glenn Gibson; and husband Donald Champion. <br>

William "Bill" F. Gibson, 87, of Ontario passed away Friday, Feb. 18, 2011, at the Bethel Home in Viroqua.<br>
Bill was born June 9, 1923, to William and Kathryn (Schmitz) Gibson on the Gibson farm near Ontario. He graduated from Ontario High School and went to the Madison School of Business. In 1943, Bill joined the United States Navy. When he returned from the Navy, he attended the University of Wisconsin-Madison and pursued a degree in geography and a double minor in French and English.<br>
In 1950, Bill was married to Lorraine Noller, who passed away a year into their marriage. On May 5, 1962, Bill was united in holy matrimony to Anita Powell at Sacred Heart Catholic Church in Cashton.<br>
Bill had many interesting professions. He worked a short time for Allis Chalmers and for the United States Library of Congress, but then his father passed away, which brought him back to his home in Ontario. Bill ran the family farm and worked for the National Weather Service for 50 years. He was a real "ginsenger" and spent many falls hunting it. Bill had a genuine green thumb and was the envy of most gardeners in the area. He crafted beautiful gardens and he reaped the produce he sowed.<br>
Bill was proud of the Gibson Family Farm and was honored to receive the Century Farm Award. Bill dedicated a lot of time and work to the village of Ontario. He was an active member of the Ontario Village Board for 27 years and was proud to be a member of the Ontario American Legion. In Bill's spare time, he was an avid reader and he looked forward to his Monday night poker games with his "friends of the roundtable." But, most of all, Bill was a family man and cherished every moment with his precious wife, children, grandchildren and great-grandchild.<br>
Bill will be deeply missed by his wife of 48 years, Anita of Ontario; six children, Catherine (Ronald) Bean of West Salem, Wis., Teresa (Robert) Bradley of Ontario, Steven (Monica) Gibson of Winona, Minn., Paul (Wanda) Gibson of Ontario, William B. Gibson of La Crosse, and Lisa (Jayson) DeWitt of Ontario; his grandchildren, Gregory and Michael Bean, Ian Bradley, Morgan, Jon, Katie, James and Madeline Gibson, and Samuel, Ben, Nathaniel, Timothy and Jackson DeWitt; his step-grandchildren, Marcella, Brian, Eric and Samantha Trejo; a great-grandchild, Evelyn Marie Baldwin; a niece, Mary (Kohnen) Ennis; along with many dear relatives and friends.<br>
Bill was preceded in death by his parents; a sister, Elsie; and other relatives and friends.<br>
A Mass of Christian Burial will be at 11 a.m. Monday, Feb. 21, at the Torkelson Funeral Home in Ontario. Father John Parr will officiate. A private family burial will be at the Hilltop Rest Cemetery at a later date. Family and friends are invited for visitation from 9-11 a.m. Monday at the funeral home. Memorials may be given in Bill's name to the Ontario library fund or to the elevator project at Sacred Heart Catholic Church in Cashton.<br>
