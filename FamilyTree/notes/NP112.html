Urien Rheged Ap CYNFARCH
<p>
<a name ="I009600"><b>[I009600]</b></a><br />
Urien, father of Owain mab Urien, was a historical king of Rheged in northern England and southern Scotland during the 6th century. He became the King Urien of Gore of Arthurian legend.<br>
<br>
Little of Urienʼs history is known for sure, but it seems that Urien fought against the rulers of the Angle kingdom Bernicia. Early on the relationship between Rheged and its neighboring British kingdoms was erratic, but Urien joined with other northern princes and defeated the rising Angles in several battles. His victories are celebrated in the Book of Taliesin, the supposed author of which served as his bard.<br>
<br>
According to early Welsh writings he was assassinated at the command of his ally Morcant who was jealous of his success.<br>
<br>
He had four sons, named Owain, Riwallawn, Run and Pascen, the eldest of which succeeded him.<br>
<br>
The Legend<br>
Urien remained a popular figure in Wales over the centuries, and he and his son Owain were incorporated into Arthurian legend as it spread from Britain to continental Europe. His kingdom was eventually transferred to the mythical land of Gore, and Kings Lot of Lothian and Auguselus of Scotland are sometimes said to be his brothers. During the reign of Uther Pendragon he marries Arthurʼs sister (often Morgan le Fay, but sometimes another sister is named). He, like the kings of several other lands, initially opposes Arthurʼs ascendance to the throne after Utherʼs death. Urien and the others rebel against the young monarch, but upon their defeat, the rebels become Arthurʼs allies and vassals.<br>
<br>
His wife is usually Morgan le Fay. His marriage is not a happy one, however, as in one story Morgan plots to take Excalibur, kill Urien and Arthur, and place herself and her lover on the throne.<br>
<br>
He is always said to be the father of Yvain (Owain), and many texts give him a second son, Yvain the Bastard, fathered on his seneschal's wife. The Welsh attribute to him a daughter named Morvydd.<br>

William D'ALBINI
<p>
<a name ="I016330"><b>[I016330]</b></a><br />
William de Albini (Brito) (d 1155-6), justiciar, was son and heir of Robert de Todeni, lord of Belvoir, and is supposed to have been named de Aubigny (Albini) from his place of birth, and to have been distinguished by the addition Brito from his namesake, the Pincerna, who belonged to a different family. He assisted in the victory of Tenchebray in 1106, and became high in favour of Henry I. IN 1130 he appears as an itinerant justice, and on Henry's death he espoused the cause of his daughter. Stephen forfeited his lands, but subsequently restored them, and he lived to see the accession of Henry II. Foss wrongly states that he died in 1135. [Dictionary of National Biography I:233]<br>
<br>
-----------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
William, who assumed, from what reason is unascertained, the surname of Albini, and was known as "William de Albini, Brito," in contradistinction to another great Baron, "William de Albini, Pincerna," from whom the Earls of Arundel descended. William de Albini, Brito, Lord of Belvoir, in the Chapter House of St. Albans, confirmed all the grants of his father and mother to the Church of Our Lady at Belvoir, desiring that he might be admitted in the fraternity as those his parents had been. This feudal lord acquired great renown at the celebrated battle of Tinchebray, in Normandy, where, commanding the horse, he charged the enemy with so much spirit that he determine at once the fate of the day. of the exploit, Matthew Paris says, "In this encounter chiefly deserveth honour the most heroic William de Albini, the Briton, who, with his sword, broke through the enemy, and terminated the battle." He subsequently adhered to the Empress Maud and had his castle of Belvoir, with all his other lands, seized by King Stephen and transferred to Ranulph, Earl of Chester. He m. Maud, dau. of Simon de St. Liz, 1st Earl of Huntingdon, widow of Robert, son of Richard de Tunbridge, and ding about the year 1155, left two sons, viz., William, surnamed Meschines, and Ralph.

<br>
Willelm de Albini Brito was a younger son of the Breton seigneur Main of Saint-Aubin-d'Aubigne (Ille-et-Vilaine) and his Norman wife Adelaide de Bohun. His cognomen Brito distinguished him from his Norman namesake, the Pincerna, who came from Saint-Martin-d'Aubigny (Manche). He assisted in the victory of Tinchebray in 1106, and became high in favour with Henry I, attesting numerous royal charters, the earliest belonging to the period 1104 to 1116. He married Cecilia, daughter of Roger Bigod and Adeliz de Tosny and (after her mother's death post 1136) principal coheiress of her maternal grandfather Robert de Tosny, lord of the honour of Belvoir in Lincolnshire (d 1088). William appears to have held land in Lincolnshire, Leicestershire, Essex, Hertfordshire and Northamptonshire, some or all of which was his wife's marriage portion. The bulk of the Tosny inheritance, however, including Belvoir, appears not to have been held by William and Cecilia until c 1130, after the death of Cecilia's mother Adeliz. Cecilia's younger sister Maud married William de Albini Pincerna. In 1130 William appears as an itinerant justice in Lincolnshire. Between 1135 and 1143 he attested a number of Lincolnshire charters by King Stephen. In 1146 Stephen granted William's estates to Ranulf of Chester. The general tenor of the grant, and the absence of any indication that William had joined the Empress, indicate that Stephen was granting the overlordship of William's estates in order to gain Randulf's support, and not that William had suffered any royal disfavour. William was alive at least until 1148, the earliest possible date for a charter he gave for Pipewell abbey (Northants). By his wife (who survived him) he had issue two daughters, Matilda and Basilia, and four or five sons, including his eventual successor in Belvoir William II (d 1168) and Ralph, who died at the siege of Acre in 1191. Much of the information on William's family comes from the 'Liber Vitae' of Thorney Abbey, where their anniversaries were remembered. William and Cecilia completed the foundation of Belvoir priory, begun by Robert de Tosny. They and many of their descendants were buried there. [Domesday Descendants pp271-272]<br>

William III D'ALBINI
<p>
<a name ="I016326"><b>[I016326]</b></a><br />
William de Albini, feudal Lord of Belvoir, in the 6th of Richard I [1195], was with that monarch in the army in Normandy, and the next year was sheriff of the counties of Warwick and Leicester, as he was subsequently of Rutlandshire. In the 2nd of King John [1201], he had special license to make a park at Stoke, in Northampton, and liberty to hunt the fox and hare (it lying within the royal forest of Rockingham). Afterwards, however, he took up arms with the other barons and, leaving Belvoir well fortified, he assumed the governorship of Rochester Castle, which he held out for three months against the Royalists, and ultimately only surrendered when reduced to the last state of famine. Upon the surrender of Rochester, William Albini was sent prisoner to Corfe Castle, and there detained until his freedom became one of the conditions upon which Belvoir capitulated, and until he paid a ransom of 6,000 marks. In the reign of Henry III, we find him upon the other side and a principal commander at the battle of Lincoln, anno 1217, where his former associates sustained so signal a defeat. This stout baron, who had been one of the celebrated twenty-five appointed to enforce the observance of Magna Carta, m. 1st, Margery, dau. of Odonel de Umfraville, by whom he had had issue, William, Sir Odinel, Robert, and Nicholas, rector of Bottesford. He m. 2ndly, Agatha, dau. and co-heir of William Trusbut, and dying in 1236, was s. by his eldest son, William de Albini.

Blanche de Navarre (originally Blanche d'Artois) (c. 1248 - May 2, 1300), was the regent of Navarre from 1274 to 1284, and later became countess of Lancaster. She was the daughter of count Robert I of Artois, and the granddaughter of Louis VIII of France.<br>
<br>
Blanche's first marriage was to Henry I of Navarre (ruled 1270-1274) who died in 1274, her second in 1276 with Edmund Crouchback, 1st Earl of Lancaster (1245-1296), an English prince who was a younger son of Henry III and Eleanor of Provence.<br>
<br>
From 1274 to 1284 she ruled Navarre and the counties of Brie, Champagne, Troyes et Meaux for her daughter, Joan I of Navarre (ruled 1274 - 1305).<br>

</p>
William D'AUBIGNY
<p>
<a name ="I006528"><b>[I006528]</b></a><br />
"Surnamed "William with the strong hand," from the following circumstance, as related by William Dugdale: "It happened that the Queen of France [ADELAIDE OF SAVOY (RIN 1532)], being then a widow, and a very beautiful woman, became much in love with a knight from another country, who was a homely person, and in the flower of his youth; and because she thought that no man excelled him in valor, she caused a tournament to be proclaimed throughout her dominions, promising to reward those who should exercise themselves therein, according to their respective abilities; and concluded that if the person whom she so well affected should act his part better than others in those military exercises, she might marry him without any dishonor to herself. Whereupon divers gallant men, from foreign parts hasting to Paris, amongst others came this our William de Albini, ravely accoutered, and in the tournament excelled all others, overcoming many, and wounding one mortally with his lance, which being observed by the queen, she became exceedingly enamored of him, and forthwith invited him to a costly banquet, and afterwards bestowing certain jewels upon him, offered him marriage; but, having plighted his troth to the Queen of England, a widow, he refused her, whereat she grew so discontented that she consulted with her maids how she might take away his life; and in pursuance of that design, enticed him into a garden - which she descended by divers steps, under color of showing him the beast; and when she told him of its fierceness, he answered, that it was a womanish and not a manly quality to be afraid thereof. But having him there, by the advantage of a folding door, thrust him to the lion; being therefore in this danger, he rolled his mantle about his arm, and putting his hand into the mouth of the beast, pulled out his tongue by the root; which done, he followed the queen to her palace, and gave it to one of her maids to present her. Returning thereupon to England, with the fame of this glorious exploit, he was forthwith advanced to the Earldom of Arundel, and for his arms the Lion given him." He subsequently married Adeliza of Lorraine, Queen of England, widow of King Henry I., and the daughter of Godfrey, Duke of Lorraine. Adeliza had the castle of Arundel in dowry from her deceased husband, the monarch, and thus her new lord became its feudal earl, 1st Earl of Arundel in this family. The earl was one of those who solicited the Empress Maud to come to England, and received her and her brother Robert, Earl of Gloucester, at the port of Arundel, in August 1139, and in three years afterwards (1142), in the report made of King Stephen's taking William de Mandeville at St. Albans, it is stated "that before he could be laid hold on, he underwent a sharp skirmish with the king's party, wherein the Earl of Arundel, though a stout and expert soldier, was unhorsed in the midst of the water by Walceline de Oxeai, and almost drowned." In 1150, he wrote himself Earl of Chichester, but we find him styled again Earl of Arundel, upon a very memorable occasion, namely, the reconciliation of Henry, Duke of Normandy, afterwards King Henry II (RIN 761)., and King Stephen at the siege of Wallingford Castle in 1152. "It was scarce possible," says Rapin, "for the armies to part without fighting. Accordingly the two leaders were preparing for battle with equal ardor, when, by the prudent advice of the Earl of Arundel, who was on the king's side, they were prevented from coming to blows." A truce and peace followed this interference of the earl's, which led to the subsequent accession of Henry after Stephen's decease, in whose favor the earl stood so high that he not only obtained for himself and his heirs the castle and honor of Arundel, but a confirmation of the Earldom of Sussex, of which county he was really earl, by a grant of the Tertium Denarium of the pleas of the shire. In 1164, we find the Earl of Arundel deputed with Gilbert Foliot, Bishop of London, to remonstrate with Louis VII, King of France (RIN 1530), upon according an asylum to Thomas a Becket within his dominions, and on the failure of that mission, dispatched with the archbishop of York, the Bishops of Winchester, London, Chichester, and Exeter, Wido Rufus, Richard de Invecestre, John de Oxford (priests), Hugh de Gundevile, Bernard de St. Valery, and Henry Fitzgerald, to lay the whole affair of Becket at the foot of the pontifical throne. Upon levying the aid for the marriage of the king's daughter, in the 12th year of Henry II., the knight's fees of the honor of Arundel were certified to be ninety-seven, and those in Norfolk, belonging to the earl, forty-two. In 1173, we find the Earl of Arundel commanding, in conjunction with William, Earl of Mandeville, the king's army in Normandy, and compelling the French monarch to abandon Verneuil after a long siege, and in the next year, with Richard de Lucy, Justice of England, defeating Robert, Earl of Leicester (RIN 861), then in rebellion at St. Edmundbury. This potent nobleman, after founding and endowing several religious houses, died at Waverley, in Surrey, on October 3, 1176, and was buried in the Abbey of Wymondham. Buried in Wymondham Priory, NOR, England; Earl of Arundel, Earl of Lincoln. With his marriage to Adela, widow of Henry I, acquired Arundel Castle as part of her dowry. His possession of the castle and honor of Arundel was confirmed by Henry II in 1154."<br>

Richard D'AUTUN
<p>
<a name ="I007736"><b>[I007736]</b></a><br />
From Wikipedia<br>
<br>
Richard of Autun (ca.867-September 1, 921) was Count of Autun and the first Duke of Burgundy.<br>
<br>
Richard was reportedly son to either Theodore, Count of Ardennes or Boso, Count of Metz by his wife Richilde the Frank. Either of the two men may have been his paternal uncle. Richard was brother or possibly first cousin to Richilde, second wife of Charles the Bald.<br>
<br>
The duchy was entrusted upon him by king Charles the Bald, his brother-in-law, in 887. The lands of Burgundy initially comprised the counties of Autun, Macon, Chalon-sur-Sane, Langres, Nevers, Auxerre and Sens, but in the following centuries, the duchy would expand far beyond these counties.<br>
<br>
Richard married Adelaide of Auxerre in 888. She was daughter to Conrad II, Count of Auxerre and Ermentrude of Alsace. They had several sons and daughters including:<br>
    * Rudolph, Duke of Burgundy.<br>
    * Hugh, Duke of Burgundy.<br>
    * Ermengarde of Burgundy. Married to Gilbert of Chalon, Duke of Burgundy.<br>
    * Willa of Burgundy. Married first to Hugh, Count of Vienne and secondly to Boso, Count of Arles.<br>

Henri D'EU
<p>
<a name ="I095229"><b>[I095229]</b></a><br />
He was a minor at his father's death and was, for some years, in the custody of [his maternal grandfather, WILLIAM D'AUBIGNY (RIN 930)] the Earl of Arundel. Henry was one of the adherents of [the "young king"] Henry in the rebellion of 1173. He had a son, Raoul, who was his heir, but died as a minor and childless in 1186.<br>
The estates and titles went to his daughter, ALICE, then temporarily to his brother, John, when Alice's death was erroneously reported. Upon John's death, Alice regained the estates and they passed into the Lusignan family upon her marriage to Raoul de Lusignan.<br>
</p>
John D'EU
<p>
<a name ="I006628"><b>[I006628]</b></a><br />
Per Cockayne's "Complete Peerage" (EU, p.155), he was Count of Eu and Lord of Hastings. KING STEPHEN (RIN 3890) gave him custody of the castle of Tickhill. Having been taken prisoner at the battle of Lincoln in<br>
1140, the castle was siezed by the victors and John never recovered it.<br>
John was at the Council of Clarendon in 1163. He finished his years as a monk at Foucarmot. John had 4 sons - his heir HENRY, another Henry and John (both churcmen), and Robert, who died at Acre. He also had 2 unnamed daughters. The younger John was an adherent of KING JOHN and was given all the lands of his father in 1202 upon the false report of the death of the Countess Alice [his niece] and held it until his death in about 1207, when the estates went back to Alice.<br>

The was given estates, including the honour of Hastings, in England by WILLIAM THE CONQUERER. In 1069 he and Robert, Count of Mortain, defeated the Danish invaders in Lincolnshire. along with many other Norman lords, in 1089, he deserted Duke Robert of<br>
Normandy and placed his castles at the disposal of King William Rufus.<br>
</p>
William II D'EU
<p>
<a name ="I015404"><b>[I015404]</b></a><br />
Weis' "Ancestral Roots. . ." (139:25). Note that this individual has been for centuries confused, even by Cokayne, with another William of EU (RIN 8776*). The relationship between the two Williams, if any, has not been determined. See the following notes for more details. Per Cockayne's "Complete Peerage" (EU, pp. 153-154), he was Count of Eu and Lord of Hastings and held extensive estates. In 1088 he took a prominent place in the rebellion against King William Rufus in favor of Duke Robert of Normandy, invading Gloucestershire and destroying the town of Berkely. In 903 Rufus won him back to his side by bribes and promises, but in 1095 William participated in Mowbray's plot to kill King William and place [Eudes (RIN 1820)] the disinherited Count of Champagne on the throne in his place. [Traditionally it has been said that] at the Council of Salisbury in 1095/6 William was charged with treason, and having been vanquished in single combat by his accuser, was condemned to be blinded and (at the insistence of [his brother-in-law] Hugh of Avranches, Earl of Chester (RIN 3101)) emasculated. [However, see a later note refuting this.] Nothing further is known about him, and he must have died then or soon afterwards. "Genealogy of the Dutton family Pennsylvania" compiled by Gilbert Cope, printed in 1871, reports that, according to "Burke's Landed Gentry, p. 1508, William and his second wife (whom Cope calls Jeanne rather than HELISINDE) were parents of six sons. One of these sons was ODARD OF DUTTON (RIN 5274), who was the ancestor of all Duttons in England. The Cokayne article cited above, however, mentions no children born to Willam by the niece of Hugh of Avranches, Earl of Chester -by whatever name we choose to call her. UTZ@@aol.com [Dave Utzinger] posted to GEN-MEDIEVAL-L@@rootsweb.com on 10 Jan 1999 Subject: HENRY II, COUNT OF EU--PART 3" . "Notes for William II, Count of Eu:<br>
Succeeded on his father's death in 1090 to his English Barony and Norman County of Eu. The occupation of Eu by an English garrison was an act of treason to the Duke of Normandy, but Count William became within a few months the subject de jure as well as de facto of the King of England, for on Candlemas day 1091 William Rufus crossed over with a large fleet, and before the end of February a treaty was concluded, by which the County of Eu was ceded to the English King. Three years afterwards the war between Duke Robert and his brother was renewed, and at Mid Lent 1094 King William crossed over again from Hastings, and fixed his head-quarters at EU. But Robert engaged the assistance of the French King, and William Rufus would have been besieged at Eu by their united forces whilst he was waiting for reinforcements, unless he had tricked King Philip into deserting his brother's cause. .<br>
According to all the received pedigrees the Count of Eu was in 1095 one of the leaders in the conspiracy to put Stephen Count of Aumale on the throne of England, for French and English genealogists are agreed in identifying him with William of Eu, who was cruelly mutilated at Salisbury in January 1096 for his treason . This agreement is the more remarkable, because William of Eu's cruel punishment is mentioned in every chronicle of the period, and they all without exception avoid describing the sufferer as the Count of Eu: whilst all that is known about him suggests that he and the Count of Eu were two different and distinct persons. The Count of Eu, and William of Eu are separately registered in Domesday, which gives no hint of any connection or relationship between them. Domesday suggests that William succeeded his own mother and Ralph de Limesi in the ownership of some 77 manors in the Western and South-Western Counties, which for the most part belonged in the time of Edward the Confessor to Alestan of Boscombe in Wiltshire. They were scattered over nine counties and were valued at L401 per annum. They formed therefore a Barony of great importance, for there were scarcely 20 lay fiefs in the kingdom which were of greater value. They were afterwards known collectively as the Honour of Strigul, for the Castle of Strigul or (as it was afterwards called) Chepstow was the head of this Barony, which passed in its entirety after William's forfeiture, by the grant of William Rufus, to Walter a younger son of Richard de Clare, who was the son of Count Gilbert of Eu of the elder line. It must be suspected that this grant to Walter was earned by Gilbert's timely denunciation of his accomplices, amongst whom William of Eu was Conspicuous. And if Walter was (as is likely) William's cousin through their common descent from the disinherited Count Gilbert of Eu, it was in strict accordance with the settled policy of this period, that the estates forfeited by William of Eu should be transferred to a more loyal kinsman. Walter transmitted these estates to his heirs, and it is certain that no claim was ever made to them by Count William's son Count Henry of Eu, although be was in high favour with King Henry I. and inherited without question the Domesday Barony of the Count of Eu, which must have been forfeited with the rest, if the traitor of 1096 was the Count. . Again, I cannot believe that William of Eu's steward William de Alderie, who suffered with him at Salisbury and was the son of his maternal aunt, was the nephew of Beatrix Countess of Eu. Moreover, it is quite certain that William of Eu's wife, who was the Earl of Chester's sister, and whose jealousy was fatal to her husband, was not the wife of William Count of Eu , for it was judicially proved in 1220 that the mother of Count William's son and successor (Count Henry) was the daughter of Roger de Busli the Domesday Baron of Tickhill in Yorkshire. It is marvellous that in the face of such evidence the sufferer of 1096 was ever mistaken for the Count of Eu, and that this mistaken identity has been unsuspectingly repeated by every genealogist English and French from Dugdale and Pere Anselm to Planche and Freeman. It was never in fact called in question until 1878, when the late Mr. Eyton inferred from the antecedents of William of Eu's estate in Dorset, that be had been "erroneously identified with the Count of Eu."<br>
This mistake has been a fruitful parent of error and confusion in the pedigree, for as William of Eu's wife was beyond all doubt sister of the Earl of Chester, the heiress of Tickbill had to be pushed back to the preceding generation, although it was distinctly proved in the law suit of 1220, that she was the mother of Count Henry of Eu. This error led to another, because it was chronologically impossible that Beatrix Countess of Eu, who was married long before the Conquest could be the daughter of Roger de Busli of Domesday. It was therefore assumed that Beatrix was Roger's sister, although in that case her descendant's title to the Barony would have been inferior to that of her opponent, who was the heir beyond all question of Roger de Busli's brother.<br>
All that the French genealogists can tell us about Count William II beyond the names of his parents and his children is an anecdote recorded by Guibert de Nogent, who tells us that the Count was at Rouen in 1096, after the first Crusade was proclaimed, when he rescued from the fury of the mob a Jew boy, who was educated as a Christian at the expense of his rescuer and died a nionk at the Abbey of St. Germes. The Crusade decreed at the Council of Clermont in November 1095 was proclaimed at Rouen in February 1096, so that this story, which Guibert heard from the lips of the Countess herself, is irreconcilable with the statement that the Count was mutilated in prison in England in January 1096.<br>
Count William II. died before 1100, and had issue by his wife Beatrix the daughter of Roger de Busli of Domesday and sister and heir of Roger de Busli . four sons.<br>
i. Henry I, Count of Eu, married Margaret de Sulli.<br>
ii. William de Eu. Fought gallantly in the army of Henry I, at the battle of Bourgteroude in Lent 1124, when he took Almaric de Montfort prisoner. But William was as generous as he was brave, and he knew the relentless and unforgiving character of the English King. He refused therefore to be the means of consigning Almaric to hopeless captivity for the rest of his life, and preferred to sacrifice his own prospects and career. Accordingly he released his prisoner, and accompanied him into exile, where he entered into the service of the French King and was lost henceforth to Normandy.<br>
iii. Robert de Eu.<br>
iv. Enguerrand de Eu." He is placed in the next generation by the French<br>
genealogists, who call him the fourth son of Count Henry; but this is disproved by chronological considerations, and by the express statement of the contemporary chronicler that Count Henry of Eu had only three sons.<br>
