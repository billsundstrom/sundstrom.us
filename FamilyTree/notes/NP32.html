Robert "Bob" F. Moelter 87, of Eau Claire went to be with his Heavenly Father on Sunday, February 28, 2016, while surrounded by his loving family.<br>
Bob was born on July 2, 1928, in New Richmond, WI, to parents Frank and Delia (Simon) Moelter. <br>
He met Shirley Benedict of Hudson, WI, and on February 11, 1952, they married at St. Patrick始s Church in Hudson. He entered into the United States Army, serving honorably from 1950 to 1957 and achieving the rank of Sergeant. He had a full, distinguished career of 42 years at J.H. Larson Electrical Company, which led him along the way to Eau Claire to manage the company始s Eau Claire branch from 1960 until his retirement in 1990.<br>
Throughout his life, Bob enjoyed time with his family, sharing camping and fishing adventures with family and friends. Retirement gave him the opportunity to escape Wisconsin winters with Shirley, and they enjoyed time with many old and new friends in Arizona during the winter months. Even in retirement, he was a respected hard worker, an accomplished handyman who restored several boats, RV始s, rental properties and his own home. When he wasn始t working on a project he could be found enjoying old Western movies, playing cards with family and friends or fishing.<br>
Bob was a generous and compassionate man, time and again teaching these qualities to his family by his example, always lending a hand to those in need. These virtues were driven by his Catholic faith, which guided him in his life and grew even stronger as the Lord drew him near.<br>
Bob is survived by his loving wife of 64 years, Shirley and six of his children: Jane Moelter of Golden Valley, MN, Mike Moelter (Marlene) of Jim Falls, WI, Steve Moelter (Christine) of Trempealeau, WI, Poppy Moelter (Ron Ricci), Sue Riley (Chuck) both from Eau Claire, and Bob Moelter (Cynthia) of Elk Mound, WI. He was blessed with sixteen grandchildren: Frank, Christopher, Shannon, Lindsey, Cora, Kevin, Maria, Justin, Christian, Alex, Alana, Kayla, Samantha, Gracie, Joe, and William; as well as nine great-grandchildren.He is also survived by two brothers, Gene (Jane) Moelter of Cornell, WI, and David Moelter of Balsam Lake, WI; one sister, Marie (Jim) King of Hudson, WI; and many beloved nieces and nephews.<br>
Bob was preceded in death by two infant sons, Patrick Lee and Timothy Mark; as well as his parents; brother, Frank Moelter; sisters, Margaret (Schweizer) and Betty Lou (Mathys); and three brothers-in-law.<br>
Mass of Christian Burial will be held at 11 a.m. on Thursday March 3, 2016, at Sacred Heart Church, 418 N. Dewey St. Eau Claire, with Father George Thayilkuzhithottu officiating.

KILLED ON THE SHORT LINE<br>
THOMAS BENNEPBECK, A SEPTUAGENARIAN,<br>
STRUCK BY A MILWAUKEE TRAIN<br>
An old man named Thomas Bennepbeck, living at 393 Colburne Street, was run down by a Milwaukee Short Line train at Ridgewood shortly after 8 o'clock yesterday morning, and injured so that he died at St. Joseph' hospital soon after he was taken there.  He was seventy-one years old. All that is known about the matter by his family is that he started out for a walk shortly after breakfast.  Then engineer of the train claims that he rang the bell and blew the whistle, but the man failed to step out of danger.  He was struck on the back of the head and knocked out of the way, so that the body is not mutilated,  The remains were not identified until last evening, and were supposed to be those of a man named Anton Kitzberger of New Ulm, who has been missing since July 2, and was believed to be in St. Paul.<br>

John BENJAMIN
<p>
<a name ="I014550"><b>[I014550]</b></a><br />
We have a discrepancy on the birth date. On Tree # 273 it shows 1598. The source stating 1585 is Church of Later Day Saints AFN:8P1S-L7. It is my opinion that his birth date is 1585, which supports the comment of his being excused from service because of age. He would have been 47 when he arrived here. This makes him 37 at time of marriage and 16 years older than Abigail, which is not uncommon.<br>
    I don't feel this gives him time to have a son John b1598, but it is possible he could have had a previous marriage.<br>
<br>
    John Benjamin and family are identified on passenger list of the LYON as well as his brother Richard.<br>
<br>
    For those of you who have access to ancestry.com..I highly recommend you read the excerpt for "Great Migration Begins: Immigrants to New England 1620-35" This article is tremendous, it addresses all the events in his life since his arrival and those of his children. It is also referenced in a book "Benjamins in America". I haven't seen that book as of yet. There is far too much information for me to relate on this family page.<br>
<br>
    In "The Complete Book of Immigrants" 1607-1660, it lists the names of men transported from London to New England to the plantations, and per certificate from Captain Mason on 6/22/1632 (date of embarkation) "have taken the oath of allegiance". Among those listed are John Benjamin and Richard Benjamin (note the spelling is Benjamin not Benjamin) (PRO E157/16).<br>
<br>
    It is thought that his great friendship with John Winthrop was the reason he came to America. Also 2 of Abigail's brothers were here.<br>

Viola Mae BENJAMIN
