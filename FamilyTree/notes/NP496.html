Colonel William T. Sichi, Retired, US Army Medical Corps, was survived by his wife of 43 years, Jean Truly Sichi, his son Andrew W. Sichi from a previous marriage to Hazel Wyatt Sichi, daughter, daughter-in-law Dianne Craig Sichi, and numerous nieces and nephews. <br>
Doctor Sichi was born in New York City on August 18, 1906, only son born to Andrea and Adella Sichi. His parents emigrated from Florence, Italy in 1900. Andrea Sichi was a master sculptor who led the creative stonecutting for the National Cathedral in Washington. <br>
Doctor Sichi completed his undergraduate studies at the University of Maryland before entering the George Washington University School of Medicine. He received his Doctor of Medicine degree in 1931. Internship was completed at nearby Garfield Hospital. He entered the United States Army in 1934 and served as General Medical Officer until his selection for residency training in ophthalmology at Walter Reed General Hospital. <br>
At the time World War II began Dr. Sichi was stationed at Gorgas Army Hospital in the Panama Canal Zone. Dr. Sichi received orders to assume command of a combat hospital in New Guinea. Following the war Dr. Sichi received additional ophthalmology training at University of Pennsylvania and became a Diplomate of the American Board of Ophthalmology in 1947. It is noted that Doctor Sichi was the first active duty military eye surgeon to become Board certified. As chief of Ophthalmology at Valley Forge General Hospital, Doctor Sichi was responsible for the post-war care and visual rehabilitation of thousands of injured war veterans. <br>
The Korean conflict erupted while Doctor Sichi was traveling to his next assignment, Brooke General Hospital at Fort Sam Houston. Brooke became a major casualty referral center, and Doctor Sichi was responsible for mobilizing a full clinical and academic teaching department to manage the enormous volume of patients. Doctor Sichi established the region's first ophthalmology residency training program at Brooke General Hospital. Many of San Antonio's finest eye surgeon's received their training at Brooke, many under the watchful instruction of Doctor Bill Sichi. <br>
Colonel Sichi completed his 21-year military career in 1955 while stationed in Europe as Chief of the Eye Service at both the 130th General Hospital Heidelberg as well as the Army General Hospital in Frankfurt. He was Chief Ophthalmology Consultant for the European Theatre. <br>
Doctor Sichi returned to the Alamo City to open a vigorous civilian practice. He remained close to military medicine, and served as civilian consultant to Brooke Army Medical Center until 1977 whereupon the US Army Surgeon General designated him Consultant Emeritus. <br>
Doctor Sichi loved all sports, but his favorite pastime was golf. He played regularly at Fort Sam Houston and area golf courses, and in later years found enormous pleasure watching all of the televised competitions. <br>
Professional memberships and associations include the American Medical Association, the Society of Military Ophthalmologists, the San Antonio Society of Ophthalmology, the American Academy of Ophthalmology, and the Bexar County Medical Society. He was greatly admired for his compassionate approach to patients, his encyclopedic knowledge, and his keen sense of humor. <br>
Doctor Bill Sichi was a voracious reader: history, biographies, military campaigns, and fiction. He remained in touch with the past trainees and colleagues. Every year the new residents were introduced to Doctor Sichi in order to better grasp the living history of the Brooke program, as well as the strength and intelligence of its founder. We shall miss him greatly. <br>

His proudest achievement, begun in 1983 and completed in 1985, was helping to design and build the first complete, automatic-fueling and lubricating diesel locomotive engine for the Burlington Northern Railroad. In Stuartʼs own words, his career was one that he "would not trade for anything!" Stu married Lorraine Ethel "Becky" McCarthy on December 9, 1988, after a lengthy and committed long-distance romance. He enjoyed collecting railroad artifacts and memorabilia, and relaxing, tinkering, and hunting at their cabin in Wascott, Wis. A talented woodworker, Stu took pride in crafting toys, walking sticks and other fun and useful projects for family and friends. His favorite activities included playing golf with his buddies, and spending family time with his beloved bride, Becky and their children, grandchildren and great-grandchildren.
