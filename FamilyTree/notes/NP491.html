Isaac SHELDON
<p>
<a name ="I006951"><b>[I006951]</b></a><br />
From the "Caney/Peckham Genealogy" by Susan P. Canney at www.Ancestry.com World Tree - Database: 'canney' - (New England Historic Genealogical Society):<br>
In 1652 as a young man without family he was given permission by the town of Windsor "to keep house together in the house that is Isaac's" with Samuel Rockwell. Sheldon had then recently bought the first Peter Tilton house. In<br>
1654 Isaac removed to Northampton, Ma.<br>
The date of the marriage of Isaac Sheldon and Mary Woodford is not known, but it must have taken place after 13 September 1652, when the Windsor authorities allowed Isaac Sheldon and Samuel Rockwell to keep bachelor's hall. As Isaac's daughter Mary married John Bridgman, 11 January 1670/1, when she was presumably at least fifteen years old, she was born about 1655, and therefore Sheldon's marriage must have taken place about 1653 or 1654.<br>
On 25 June 1657 Isaac was granted six acres of land by the town of Northampton. His home-lot of two acres was bounded west on the highway, east "against the brooke" "Lying against the Landes of Thomas Woodford southrly and Samuell Allen Northrly." He also had two acres on the other side of the highway, eight acres in the Third Square, four acres in the Great Rainbow alias Old Rainbow, three acres in the little Rainbow alias Young Rainbow, four and one-half acres in the East Division, and eleven and one-half acres at Hog's Bladder. On 2 December 1661, he bought land of his father-in-law Thomas Woodford, in the Last Division.<br>
On the 31st of the first month, March 1663, Isaac was admitted a freeman in the Massachusetts Bay Colony, and he was one of the residents of Northampton who, on the eighth of February, 1678/79, took the oath of allegiance to Charles the Second.<br>
At a town meeting held in February 1665/66 he was appointed fenceviewer for the First Division from the Great River, and for that section of the town known as Hog's Bladder, in March 1669/70, January 1670/71, February 1671/72, January 1672/73. He was chosen Constable in January 1668/69 and was sworn into office at a session of the Court held 30 March following. At a session of the Court held in September 1676, Lieutenant William Clark was appointed to administer the Constable's oath to him, indicating another election of Sheldon to that office.<br>

William SHELLEY
<p>
<a name ="I004545"><b>[I004545]</b></a><br />
Eldest son of Sir John; sent to the Inner Temple to study law; made a judge of the common pleas by Henry VIII in 1527; summoned tp parliament 9 Aug 1529 and again 27 Apr 1536; hostile to the reformation and suffered from Cromwell's antipathy.<br>
<br>
Alice m Sir WILLIAM SHELLEY whose 1/4 share in the manor went to the husbands of his wife's sisters (ie probably died without issue). [Seems not - without male issue perhaps.)<br>
---<br>
The Rule in Shelley's Case is an important decision in the law of real property. The litigation was brought about by the settlement made by Sir William Shelley (c. 1480-1549), a judge of the common pleas, of an estate which he had purchased on the dissolution of Sion Monastery. After prolonged argument the celebrated rule was laid down by Lord Chancellor Sir Thomas Bromley, who presided over an assembly of all the judges to hear the case in Easter term 1580-1581. The rule may be stated as follows: when an ancestor by any gift or conveyance takes an estate of freehold and in the same gift or conveyance an estate is limited, either mediately or immediately, to his heirs or the heirs of his body, in such a case the word " heirs " is a word of limitation and not of purchase; that is to say, the estate of the ancestor is not a life or other freehold estate with remainder to the heirs or heirs of the body, but an estate in fee or an estate tail according to circumstances. The rule is a highly technical one, and has led to much litigation and in many cases without a doubt to the defeat of a testator's intentions. It is said to have had its origin in the wish of the law to preserve to the lords their right of wardship, which would have been ousted by the heir taking as purchaser and not as successor. The rule is reported by Lord Coke in i Reports 93 b. (see also Van Grutten v. Foxwell, 1897, A.C. 658).<br>
