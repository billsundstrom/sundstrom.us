<p>
<a name ="I090764"><b>[I090764]</b></a><br />
"I am a third generation Illini. (I was born in Champaignʼs Burnham hospital, since razed.) My paternal grandfather and namesake, William Nichols Butler, graduated in 1879. He may have been president of the alumni association at some time. A family story was that he helped plant the rows of trees that for many years lined the broadwalk on the west side of the Quad. My mother, Mary Rachel Hein (BS ʼ17, home economics) and father, William Glenn Butler (BS ʼ17, agriculture) met in a U of I chemistry class; and I met my wife, Eileene Louise Daehler Butler (AB ʼ47, general curriculum; AM ʼ50, teaching of English) when I was in graduate school (and living in the old Parade Grounds Units) on the Urbana-Champaign campus. My maternal grandmother, Liva Hein, moved to Champaign (from Tampico, birthplace of Ronald Reagan) after she was widowed, so that her children, my mother and my uncle, Mason A. Hein (BS ʼ17, agriculture) might receive a good education. She opened a rooming/boarding house for male students (she called them her ʻboysʼ), many of whom remained in touch with ʻMa Hein,ʼ even during and after WWI. My parents remembered their days at U of I and their lives in Urbana-Champaign fondly, and remained loyal supporters after they left there in 1932. A few years ago I gave a number of Homecoming pins and U of I postcards to the alumni association for their collection, and until recently I still had several mementos from my parentsʼ years at the University."<br>

Blanche Helen BUXTON
<p>
<a name ="I037331"><b>[I037331]</b></a><br />
Blance [sic] Helen Buxton, born at Carlyle, Ill., January 24, 1874, was the second daughter of Harvey Parris Buxton and Eunice Josephine Buxton.<br>
She was graduated from the Illinois Woman's College, Jacksonville, in 1892, and took special work at the University of California within the last few years.<br>
In June, 1894, she was married to Henry Griffith Barnes and to this union were born two children, who still survive.<br>
In October 1912 she was married to A. L. Hunt of Olathe, Kas., who preceded her in death in December, 1918.<br>
Eighteen years of her life were spent in the education of the deaf, among whom she had many loyal and devoted friends. During her career as an educator she taught in the following state institutions for the deaf: Little Rock, Ark., Jacksonville, Fla., Jacksonville, Ill., Olathe, Kans., and Berkeley, Calif.<br>
During her life time Mrs. Hunt had the advantage of residing in many different cities in the United States. Her early girlhood was spent at Carlyle Ill. and in Jacksonville, Ill, where she received her education. Part of the early years of her married life were spent at St. Paul, Minn., and Olathe, Kans., was the scene of many happy years.<br>
Following Mr. Hunt's death she went to Oakland, Calif., where she spent four years with her mother, Mrs. E. J. B. Harris and her sister, Mrs. John N. Cooper. During this time she engaged in teaching in the California School for the Deaf at Berkeley, rising to an advanced position in her profession.<br>
In June 1924 she resigned her position in order to come to Illinois and be with her son during his senior year at the University of Illinois, and to visit her sister, Mrs. F. S. Brown at Divernon.<br>
Shortly after her arrival in Illinois she became very ill and a long tedious sojourn in St. Luke's hospital, Chicago, became necessary.<br>
After an operation in October, her condition was so serious that she was unable to leave the hospital until the seventh of December, when she was brought to the home of her sister, Mrs. F. S. Brown, in the care of the latter and a nurse.<br>
Here, in spite of the forebodings of several famous Chicago physicians her health improved rapidly, until she was sufficiently recovered to be able to keep house for her son in Urbana during the last semester of his senior year's work at the University of Illinois.<br>
To her was given the joy of being present at his graduation in June when he received the degree of Bachelor of Science, and she also shared in his triumphs in the athletic contests when he received a loving cup and other honors accorded the welterweight champion in wrestling and boxing.<br>
She came to Maple Hill the later part of June in order to be present at the wedding of her niece Miss Eunice Josephine Brown to Lewis Turner in July. Since that time her health failed rapidly. On August 10 her daughter and one grandchild, Mirian, arrived, fulfilling a final wish to see the baby, and she passed away Wednesday evening, September 2, surrounded by the loved ones for her family.<br>
In early childhood she became a member of the Methodist church, to which, she has been devoted all her life. She was a member of the Easter Star and the Woman's Relief Corps.<br>
Surviving her are one daughter, Helen Mae, now Mrs. R. E. Johnson of Napa, Calif., one son Harvey Buxton Barnes of Urbana; two grandchildren, Raymond Edgar Johnson and Helen Miriam Johnson; her mother, Mrs. E. J. B. Harris of Oakland, Calif., three half brother, Paul W. Buxton of Fayetteville, Ark.; one brother, Edwin W. Buxton, Martinez, Calif.; one step brother, Dr. Ne. E. Harris; four step sisters, Miss Eula Harris, Mrs. Alma Harris-Hills, all of California; Mrs. Lucille Harris Orton of Lincoln, Ill.; and Mrs. Catherine Harris-Parker of Garden City, N. Y.<br>
A short service was held at the home of Mr. and Mrs. F. S. Brown in charge of Rev. Scroggs, pastor of the First Presbyterian church in Divernon. The body was brought to Olathe and the funeral service held at the Methodist church at 3 p.m. Friday.<br>
