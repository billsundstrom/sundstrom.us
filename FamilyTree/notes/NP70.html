<h2>Notes</h2>
Idwal ap CADWALADR
<p>
<a name ="I008706"><b>[I008706]</b></a><br />
From Wikipedia<br>
<br>
Idwal ap Cadwaladr (c.650-720; reigned from c.682) (Latin: Ituvellus; English: Judwald), also known as Idwal Iwrch ('Roebuck'), was a king of Gwynedd.<br>
<br>
Following the death of Idwal's father, Cadwaladr Fendigaid, the history of Gwynedd enters into a somewhat hazy period. His nickname of 'Roebuck' suggests a young man of small stature, and the historical record indicates that he was probably not involved in any major, prolonged conflicts with neighboring kingdoms, focusing instead on the domestic situation of Gwynedd.<br>
<br>
Nonetheless, it was during the time of Idwal's reign that the nearby kingdom of Mercia to the west was growing in power and influence. Idwal may have been involved in a series of raids on Mercian territory carried out by the neighboring Welsh kingdom of Powys during the reign of the Mercian king Coenred. These raids, if they did indeed occur, and if Gwynedd was indeed involved, seem to have been relatively isolated, and did not result in any sort of more organized conflict.<br>

Cadwladr ap CADWALLON
<p>
<a name ="I008707"><b>[I008707]</b></a><br />
From Wikipedia<br>
<br>
Cadwaladr ap Cadwallon (c. 633-682, reigned from c. 655) (Latin: Catuvelladurus; English: Cadwallader), also known as Cadwaladr Fendigaid ('the Blessed') was a king of Gwynedd. Welsh chroniclers consider him to be one the greatest British kings to have ever lived, Geoffrey of Monmouth included him in his Historia Regum Britanniae (vii,3) as the last in the line of legendary Kings of the Britons. His standard, the red dragon, was later adopted by Henry VII of England, founder of the Tudor dynasty , who claimed descent from Cadwaladr.<br>
<br>
The son of Cadwallon ap Cadfan, Cadwaladr was only a child when his father was killed by the army of Oswald of Bernicia at the Battle of Heavenfield, and Cadfael Cadomedd took over in Gwynedd. Raised abroad, either in Ireland, Brittany or in a neighboring Welsh kingdom, Cadwaladr eventually reclaimed his family's throne from Cadfael, and went on to challenge the West Saxons in Somerset in 658, unsuccessfully. Cadwaladr was arguably the last Welsh ruler to mount a serious counteroffensive against the Anglo-Saxon forces that had overrun England since the fall of the Western Roman Empire. It may be for this reason that Geoffrey of Monmouth chose to end his narrative of British kings with Cadwaladr.<br>
<br>
After these initial military escapades, Cadwaladr seemingly settled down and focused on the domestic situation, establishing several religious foundations in Gwynedd and gaining a reputation as a devout, pious leader; so much so that, after his death, the Welsh church came to regard him as a saint.<br>
<br>
According to the Annales Cambriae, he died of plague in 682. Other sources suggest he may have been the victim of an earlier plague, in 663/664, but such an early death would seem to extend the reign of his successor, Idwal to an improbable length.<br>

Maelgwn ap CADWALLON
<p>
<a name ="I008716"><b>[I008716]</b></a><br />
From Wikipedia<br>
<br>
Maelgwn ap Cadwallon (c.480-c.547, reigned from 520s?) (Latin: Maglocunus; English: Malcolm), also known as Maelgwn Gwynedd and Maelgwn Hir ('the Tall'), was king of Gwynedd, and a character from Celtic mythology.<br>
<br>
The historical Maelgwn was one of the most influential rulers of 6th century Britain, and has become one of the most famous (or infamous) leaders in Welsh history. The Christian writer Gildas (who referred to him Malgocunus, meaning 'Great Hound') attacked him in De Excidio Britanniae as 'first in evil,' one of the most vicious tyrants in British history, and accused him of having murdered his uncle while still a youth. Geoffrey of Monmouth (calling him Malgo) specifically noted his handsome features, but also claimed that he was homosexual. Other notable misdeeds said to have been performed by Maelgwn include murdering his first wife and his nephew in order to clam his nephew's wife as his own. Maelgwn remained rather unpopular with leading church writers, despite several attempts at patronage, including founding the bishopric of Bangor.<br>
<br>
He was also said to be a great patron of the arts and a skilled lawgiver, although some attribute this reputation to Maelgwn's own propaganda. He established court at Deganwy, and surrounded himself with an entourage of bards and artisans who wrote glowingly of his achievements. By the time of his death, Maelgwn had established himself as the preeminent ruler of the region, and his sons Rhun and Brude would inherit control over both Gwynedd and the lands of the Picts in southern Britain.<br>
<br>
Elias Gruffydd preserved the following mythological tradition in a manuscript he wrote in the mid-16th century, although some critics believe this story is much older.<br>
<br>
    King Maelgwn demanded that a distant son of one of his lords, Elphin, praise him and his court. Elphin refused, claiming his bard, Taliesin was a better bard and his wife a prettier woman than anyone the King had in his court. Taliesin knew what was happening, because he was a seer, and told Elphin's wife. Maelgwn's son Rhun went to Elphin's house to seduce his wife and prove Elphin's claims weren't true. Rhun got her drunk. When she passed out, Rhun tried to take her wedding ring off to prove her unfaithfulness; since the ring wouldn't come off, he cut off her finger. When King Maelgwn attempted to show the finger to Elphin, he pointed out that his wife cut her fingernails more often than the owner of the finger, had servants to kneed dough and never had any under her nails, and her ring was loose on her finger, and that one was tight.<br>
<br>
    Maelgwn demanded Taliesin come to his court to prove the other claim wrong. Taliesin gave twenty minutes for both himself and the King's bards to come up with an epic. The royal bards couldn't do it. When it came Taliesin's time, he caused a massive wind to rattle the castle. Frightened, Maelgwn sent for Elphin. Taliesin's next song caused Elphin's chains to detach. Maelgwn challenged the pair to a horse race. Taleisin arrived the next day with an old, weak horse. As each of the king's horses passed him at the very start of the race, Taliesin touched its rump with a twig of holly. When they had all passed, he dropped his hat to the ground. When the king's horses came back, right before the finish line, they stopped at the holly twigs Taliesin had laid there, and began to dance. Taliesin's old horse strolled back in quite a bit later and won the race.<br>
<br>
The 1911 Britannica has this tale to tell of him...<br>
    The first Eisteddfod of which any account seems to have descended to us was one held on the banks of the Conway in the 6th century, under the auspices of Maelgwn Gwynedd, prince of North Wales. Maelgwn on this occasion, in order to prove the superiority of vocal song over instrumental music, is recorded to have offered a reward to such bards and minstrels as should swim over the Conway. There were several competitors, but on their arrival on the opposite shore the harpers found themselves unable to play owing to the injury their harps had sustained from the water, while the bards were in as good tune as ever.<br>
<br>
Maelgwn 'the Dragon of the Isle' was also a main character in the two trilogies ('The Ancient Future' trilogy and 'The Celestial Triad') written by Australian author Traci Harding. In the books, Maelgwn is portrayed as a fair, kind and loving man, whose childhood tutor was Taliesin. His father Caswallon was imprisoned by his uncle Cadfer, who then raped his mother Sorcha Lawhir (she killed herself rather than live with the consequences of the rape). Maelgwn killed his uncle eventually, and gave the throne back to his father.<br>

[The seventh, Julia Cady Johnson, was a half-sister.] She went to school in New York State and came to Michigan with her parents in 1864 at the urging of her two older brothers, Oliver and Daniel Waterman Cady. [1933 article says oldest brother, George W. Cady did the urging. Also, her father died in 1849, so "parents" should be "mother".] The Cadys settled on a farm on the East Avenue road, later owned by Miles A. Curtis.<br>
In 1866 Frances Cady was married to George Haddock and became the mother of an only daughter, Georgia, now Mrs. Burt. The Haddocks occupied the fine old Brooks place on the site of what is now the Willard Library.

Mrs. Hull was for many years affectionately known to her family and among her close friends as "Bomie", a name given to her by her grandson, the late Harold Burt, when he was a baby. She has lived through a period which has seen the United States at war five times. [Mexican, Civil, Spanish-American, WWI, WWII]<br>
Mrs. Hull was a member of the First Church of Christ, Scientist, and of the Daughters of the American Revolution through her great-grandfather, who served In Washington's army. She had a brother who saw service in the Civil war, and now there is a grandson in the Navy.<br>
Besides her daughter, Mrs. Hull leaves a grandson, Robert Burt, a research scientist with the Lockheed Airplane Co. in Pasadena, California. Two [great] grandchildren, Fredrick Bedell Burt, who is in the navy taking a special college training course, and Mrs. Earl (Betty Jane) Gates [Elizabeth Jane Burt] of Coral Gables, Fla.; One [great] great-grandchild, Harold Chapman Gates, now two and one-half years old.

She was 92.<br>
Her listeners felt a spiritual uplifting through her music because she played it with such conviction, said Mrs. Kilgore's daughter, Carmen Nylund of Mukilteo.<br>

At home, Mrs. Kilgore always had a piano or an organ, sometimes both, her daughter said.<br>
Mrs. Kilgore worked for Western Farmers Association on Elliott Avenue until she retired in 1970.<br>
Mrs. Kilgore remained active in her church women's group and in the Salvation Army center in the Greenwood neighborhood near where she lived until her death. She took part in Bible study there and embroidered towels for sale at the group's fund-raising bazaar.<br>
