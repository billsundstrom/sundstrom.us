Anita Lorraine SUNDSTROM
<p>
<a name ="I000282"><b>[I000282]</b></a><br />
Mitchell - Anita Lorraine Sundstrom Cremer, Spencer, SD, passed away peacefully on July 15, 2018, one day and one week short of her 95th birthday.<br>
A prayer service will be held at 7pm on Friday, July 27 at Kinzley Funeral Home, Salem.<br>
Funeral Mass will begin at 10:30am on Saturday, July 28 at St. Martin's Catholic Church, Emery.<br>
Anita's parents, Otto and Helen Sundstrom, emigrated from Sweden and passed through Ellis Island in 1909. They settled on a homestead south of Artesian. The family lived in a small two-story house with two rooms upstairs (accessible by a ladder) for the children. Twins Anita and Adney were born on the family farm on July 23, 1923, the tenth and eleventh of 12 children. Anita was not expected to survive because of low birth weight and poor health. She was placed in a pan of warm water to keep her alive when she turned blue and cold.<br>
Anita, along with many of her siblings, became a teacher. She graduated from Artesian High School in 1941 and then attended DWU. She taught at a country school near Fedora and then moved to Spencer to teach.<br>
When Anita saw WWII Navy veteran Leonard Cremer walking to work at Cremer's Jack and Jill store, she declared to her roommate, "That is the man I am going to marry!" and the two were married on September 26, 1949. Together they ran the store, built their house, and filled it with eight children and numerous pets, including multiple dogs named Sparky. Anita was a member of the Spencer School PTA, the American Legion Auxiliary, the Hanson/McCook County Bookmobile Board, St. Mary's Ladies Altar Society, and St. Mary's choir. She also volunteered as a CCD teacher and program director.<br>
Anita and Leonard were wonderful parents who always encouraged us. They sacrificed so much of themselves and their time for us and our children, and we are ever so grateful. Anita will be remembered for her chocolate cake, cherry dessert, chicken noodle soup with homemade noodles, and her generosity to others who needed help. Anita enjoyed dancing with Leonard and socializing with friends, but her favorite time was spent with her family, especially reading to children. She always helped with homework but refused to simply give the answers - we had to figure it out with her help. She loved to read and do crosswords. She kept a red pen handy to correct spelling and grammatical errors in newspapers and magazines. (We hope this obituary is up to her standards.) Anita cherished coffee time with her friends. She believed that a well-fed child who could read was well on their way to success, so in lieu of flowers, please consider donating to your school's backpack program or library.<br>
She is survived by her 8 children: JoAnn (Bryan) Schierholz, Jim (Susan) Cremer, Mary (Barry) Bruns, Roger (Joan) Cremer, Karen (Jerry) Hofer, John (Maria) Cremer, David (Jill) Cremer, Paul Cremer (Toni Richardson); 20 grandchildren and 23 great-grandchildren.<br>
Anita was predeceased by her husband Leonard in 1996, her parents, her siblings and their spouses: Signe (Elis) Bachman, Anna Marie, Elsie, Lawrence (Gayle), Ernest (Iris), Olga (Albert) Peterson, Lennart (Louise), Erma (Bud) May, Natalie (Charles) Fridley, Adney (Elsie), and Daine; and one son-in-law Jerry Hofer.<br>

The following was written by Frithiof's Grandson, William (Bill) Gardner, Eden Prarie, MN, April 19, 1998<br>
ELLEN PEELSTROM and FRITIOF SUNDSTROM<br>
My grandfather, Fritiof Sundstrom, was born in Gäddvik, Sweden in 1875. Several miles away in the city of Ostergotland, my grandmother, Ellen Euginia Peelstrom, was born four years later. They were destined to meet in a small city named Madrid, in the state of Iowa, in a land called America. They would then marry, have children, and grandchildren, of which I am one, and the last my grandfather was ever to see.<br>
In the year of his birth Minnesota was a vast land of progress and promise. James J. Hill, building the St. Paul and Pacific Railroad lines, laid track at the rate of less than one mile a month. Wheat became the most important agricultural crop, production rising and falling, troubled by invasions of grasshoppers. Lumbering flourished in the north. Immigrants poured into the state from Canada, Norway, Ireland, Scotland, and Sweden, looking for work and finding it in the thick forests of Minnesota. From 1870 to 1890 the majority of immigrants were Scandinavians. But not all of these foreigners were attracted by industry.<br>
Fritiof, nearly always called "Fritz", was a young man in search of a ministry when he set foot on American shores in 1891 at the age of 16. He had been raised as a member of the Lutheran Church of Sweden, being born into that membership as were all babies at that time. The State Church had become all but dead. It needed a revival spirit. That spirit came as a flood in the latter 1800's with the Swedish Free Church movement. Many Swedes, filled with a new spiritual zeal and vitality, and feeling constrained by the stale condition of the State Church, emigrated to the United States during the last decade of the nineteenth century. Fritz Sundstrom was among them.<br>
Fritz settled first in Brookings, SD. Brookings became most memorable for two reasons: it was there he became a citizen of the United States, renouncing all allegiance to King Oscar II of Sweden in the year 1900, the 5th day of April, having lived in the United States for nine years; and it was in Brookings he received his first call to be a minister of a church.<br>
His professional ministry actually began with his ordination. He received a "Minister's Certificate of Ordination" from the First Swedish Free Mission congregation in the city of Beresford, Brooklyn Township, Lincoln County, SD on January 14, 1905. This certified him as: "Called", "Ordained", and "Accredited" as Minister of the Gospel of Jesus Christ, to perform the office and duties of a Clergyman in the United States of America as long as (he) shall be found living and teaching in accordance with the Doctrine of the Lord Jesus Christ, and his Apostles.<br>
An accompanying certificate attests to the fact that Fritiof Sundstrom was "well know as possessing a good Christian character, as a true believer in God, Jesus Christ the Savior, and (had) been proved as well qualified for the ministry". He was ordained by prayer and the laying on of hands by the elders of the Swedish Free Mission Church.<br>
Fritz received his first "call" about three months following his ordination (April 1903) from the Meriden Swedish Free Church in Meriden, Iowa. It was the first of many interim pastorates he would take over the years. Serving as an itinerant pastor was difficult work. Most difficult was pulling up stakes after only a very short time and moving from one city to the next. Pay was extremely low, often times just whatever could be collected at a service offering. Fritz kept a record book of all monies received, with some entries showing as little as $3.50 for the week.<br>
During this time 29 year old Fritz Sundstrom, a handsome, young preacher in Meriden, met 25 year old Ellen Peelstrom, a spectacled, lovely woman with wavy brown hair, who attended the Free Church in Madrid, Iowa, a few miles away.<br>
Ellen Eugenia Peelstrom was born in Ostergotland, Sweden on April 21, 1879. She immigrated to America in 1895 at the age of 16, arriving by boat in Connecticut and soon moved to Des Moines, IA to live with her brother Carl, a professional photographer. To support herself she worked as a cook in the governor's mansion during the Cummings Administration in 1904.<br>
1904 was a busy year for Fritz. He decided to leave Iowa for one year of education and training at the Swedish Bible Institute in Chicago, Illinois. This was later to become the Moody Bible Institute. He was fortunate to receive an offer of employment to preach every third Sunday in nearby Stillman Valley Free Church for as long as he was in school.<br>
The Swedish Bible Institute offered about seventeen major subjects of study to its Bible students. Besides Bible courses, students were required to enroll in classes of the English language, arithmetic, literature as an art form and concentrating on fiction, common geography, nature lessons, and history.<br>
Fritz enrolled in a number of varied Bible courses. Bible geography, the Bible as history, which included study in the Old Testament, New Testament, and a study of the time of the Apostles. He also took classes on Bible teachers, interpretation and preaching, and a class on Bible insights, which included: a. What the Bible is.; b. How it was written.; c. Bible commentaries.; and d. Bible customs. He satisfactorily completed his studies and graduated from the Institute May 12, 1905. Prior to this graduation he had received a call to a pastorate in Colorado which he accepted May 22, 1905 and left Chicago for the city of Greeley.<br>
By the fall of 1905 his separation from Ellen Peelstrom had become an unbearable burden and he sent for her to become his wife, which she did on September 5th in Denver, CO.<br>
In that year, Minnesota, which was to become the Sundstrom's future and final home, was in a transitional period. It was awakening to the twentieth century. Governor Van Sant feared defeat for reelection by up-and-coming candidate John A. Johnson. Reforms in many areas, including the juvenile court system, were instituted, and the Minnesota Highway Commission was set in motion to control the ever increasing number of "horseless carriages" being driven on Minnesota's roads. Fritz and Ellen were never to own an automobile throughout their lives.<br>
While living in Colorado, Ellen gave birth to the first of their five daughters, Hildur Aldina, on July 11, 1906. Fritz had seen the word "Aldina" at the top of an English writing tablet in school and decided upon it as a name for his first child. Their second daughter, Naomi Eugenia, was born a year later on August 16, 1907.<br>
Itinerant preaching kept the family moving and growing for the next several years. It seemed each new pastorate brought a new baby girl. Ruth Margaret was born May 22, 1910 in Beresford, SD shortly after their daughter, Naomi, died at age 2 and a half of diphtheria. Frances Marie was born in Windom, MN January 10, 1912 and Florence Elizabeth on June 16, 1915 in Trade River, WI.<br>
 In 1919, Fritz became a District Superintendent of the Swedish Free Church in Wisconsin. This job entailed much traveling either walking, using the family horse and buggy, or quite often utilizing the Minneapolis, St. Paul and Sault Sainte Marie Railroad which issued Fritz a minister's pass that entitled him to free railroad passage between all stations in Wisconsin.<br>
As District Superintendent he started Free Church works in Wisconsin, Minnesota, and South Dakota, often meeting in schoolhouses, and the homes of farmers to preach and hold prayer meetings until church buildings could be erected. He continued as District Superintendent until 1924.<br>
In 1924, Fritz and Ellen with their four daughters headed west to Salt Lake City, Utah to begin a Free Church ministry there. The Evangelical Free Church had established a work among the Mormons in 1885, which contained a large Swedish population, largely through the works of Reverend Edw. Thorell. Fritz served the Lord there for three years, resigning in 1927 to return eastward to Minnesota<br>
Minnesota had Theodore Christianson as it's governor in 1927. The people of the state marveled at the medical and surgical expertise of the Mayo brothers in Rochester, and the state's Republicans were gearing up to place their votes for Herbert Hoover in the presidential election of1928.<br>
Minneapolis became the Sundstrom's permanent home. They moved from rented house to rented house, first 1518 - 18th Avenue South, and then 2306 - 11th Avenue South, to others. Fritz continued as an itinerant preacher during the years of 1927 to his retirement at age 65 in 1940. He would preach occasionally at the First Free Church in Minneapolis and as interim pastor and guest speaker in churches in and out of town.<br>
Ellen and Fritz owned their first home after retirement, a small but comfortable house at 4337 - 15th Avenue South, not far from Lake Nokomis, with two small pine trees to either side of the front steps. It was in this house Fritz lived alone following Ellen's death on February 27, 1951, at the age of 71. The following year on March 22, Fritiof Sundstrom died in his sleep of a heart attack at the age of 76.<br>
