<h2>Notes</h2>
Gertrude Enola HALE
<p>
<a name ="I089564"><b>[I089564]</b></a><br />
It is with great sorrow that on October, 9th we bid good-by to our Mother, Grandmother and Friend, Gertrude Enola Doubleday , a woman of great beauty both inside and out. The youngest of nine children, Gertrude was born in Suttercreek, California on October, 15, 1918 to Annie and Harvey Hale. She was a highly spirited child who found joy in everything around her. Gertrude was a person who didn't worry about tomorrow but let life unravel before her with all the adventure and excitement that it had to offer. At sixteen, Gertrude went to live in Oakland, California with her older sister Mabel to finish high school and learn some social graces. Aunt Mabel shared with us that the task was difficult but the results were fabulous. Dental technician school was next for Gertrude and after graduating she began working in San Francisco. In 1940 she met the dashing Eugene Doubleday at a San Francisco dance. They were married in 1941, a union that lasted 49 years and produced three children, Laurena (1943) Carol (1945) and Fred (1951). The war years resulted in Eugene deciding to make the military his career. Gertrude traveled extensively with her husband for the next 25 years encountering many adventures along the way. She witnessed the General Tojo trial in Japan after WWII attended Alaska's Constitutional Convention hearings and in 1958, traveled down the Alcan Highway with 3 children and a dog that had just given birth to puppies. Retirement took Gertrude and Eugene to Monterey, California were the lived until Eugene's death in 1990 at which time Gertrude moved to Idaho to be near her son and daughter. Adventures abounded in Gertrude 's life but she is best remembered for her kindness to all living things, her deep faith in god and the love and unselfishness she showed to her family and friends. We will miss you Mom. Gertrude is survived by Laurena and John Christianson of Boise, ID Carol and Victor Klukkert of Salome, AZ, Fred and Barbara Doubleday of Boise, ID, grandchildren Kevin Mark and Alyssa Doubleday , Heather Littlefield Amy Dydynski, six great-grandchildren and countless friends. The family wishes to thank Aarenbrooke Assisted Living and Heart 'N Home Hospice for their wonderful care of Gertrude.<br>

A funeral Mass for Carol Parsons - the 38-year-old Lakewood woman killed last week during a counseling session with her ex-husband in Federal Way - will be held on Saturday.<br>
The service is scheduled for 11 a.m. at the St. John the Baptist Catholic Church, 25810 156th Ave. S.E., Covington.<br>
There will be a candlelight vigil at 7 p.m. Friday at the church.<br>
Parsons' former husband, Charles "Chuck" Parsons, 42, is being held at the King County Jail on $5 million bail in connection with her death.<br>
According to police and prosecutors, the Parsons divorced last year but were attending sessions at Lutheran Counseling Network in a Federal Way church to help ease the transition.<br>
Carol Parsons' brother, Howard Hales, said his sister had hoped to help her ex-husband find "closure and peace."<br>
Charles Parsons, however, wanted a reconciliation and asked Carol Parsons if she would give up her new boyfriend, according to court documents.<br>
When she refused during their March 17 session, Parsons allegedly pulled out a gun and fired, striking his ex-wife five times.<br>
The Parsons had been married 12 years and had three children: a girl, 11, and two boys, 9 and 5.<br>
The children are with relatives, and a trust has been established for their care and education.<br>

Eystein HALFDANSSON
<p>
<a name ="I008108"><b>[I008108]</b></a><br />
Eystein Halfdansson (Old Norse: Eysteinn Hálfdansson) was the son of Halfdan Hvitbeinn of the House of Yngling according to Heimskringla. He lived around 730, and inherited the throne of Romerike and Vestfold.<br>
<br>
His wife was Hild, the daughter of the king of Vestfold, Erik Agnarsson. Erik had no son so Eystein inherited Vestfold.<br>
<br>
Eystein went to Varna with some ships to pillage and carried away all livestock and other valuables. However, the king of Varna was king Skjöld who was a great warlock. Skjöld arrived at the beach and saw the sails of Eystein's ships. He waved his cloak and blew into it which caused a boom of one ship to swing and hit Eystein so that he fell overboard and drowned. His body was salvaged and buried in a mound.<br>
<br>
Eystein was inherited by his son Halfdan the Mild.<br>
</p>
Gudrød HALFDANSSON
<p>
<a name ="I007654"><b>[I007654]</b></a><br />
From Wikipedia<br>
<br>
Gudrød the Hunter (Old Norse: Guđröđr veiđikonung, Modern Icelandic: Guđröđur veiđikonung, Norwegian: Gudrød Veidekonge) was the son of Halfdan the Mild of the House of Yngling and of Liv Dagsdotter of Vestmar, according to Heimskringla, a collection of sagas from thirteenth century Iceland.<br>
<br>
Gudröd married Alfhild, a daughter of Alfarin the king of Alfheim (Bohuslän), which was the name of the area between Glomma and Göta älv, and inherited half the province of Vingulmark. They had the son Olaf Gudrødsson.<br>
<br>
When Alfhild died, Gudröd sent his warriors to Agder and its king Harald to propose a marriage with his daughter Åsa. However, Harald declined so Gudröd decided to take his daughter by force.<br>
<br>
They arrived at night time and when Harald realised that he was attacked he assembled his men and fought well, but died together with his son Gyrd. Gudröd carried away Åsa and married her. He raped her and she gave him a son named Halfdan who would be called Halfdan the Black.<br>
<br>
In the fall when Halfdan was a year old, Gudröd was having at a feast in Stiflesund. He was very drunk and in the evening as he was walking on the gangway to leave the ship, an assassin thrust a spear through Gudröd and he was killed. Gudröd's men instantly killed the assassin who turned out to be Åsa's page-boy. Åsa admitted that the page-boy had acted on her behalf.<br>

<p>
<a name ="I008127"><b>[I008127]</b></a><br />
Helgi means holy and is an old Nordic name still used in e.g. Iceland.<br>
<br>
Helgi or Halga (Beowulf), Proto-Norse *Hailagaz, was a Danish Scylding/Skjöldung king. He was the son of Halfdan (Healfdene), the brother of Hróar (Hrothgar) and the father of Hrólf Kraki (Hrothulf).<br>

Hrođgar (Proto-Norse *Hro-igaizaz, Hrothgar, Hróar, Ro), legendary Danish king.<br>
<br>
According to the epic poem Beowulf, he ruled Denmark when the Geatish hero Beowulf arrived to defeat the monster Grendel and he was married to Wealheow. He was supposed to have built a famous hall called Heorot, and according to Saxo Grammaticus in Gesta Danorum, he (Roar or Ro) founded the town Roskilde.

Ivar HALFDANSSON
<p>
<a name ="I008570"><b>[I008570]</b></a><br />
From Wikipedia<br>
<br>
Ivar Vidfamne. Ívarr inn vı́đfađmi or Ivar Vidfamne was a semi-legendary king of Sweden c. 655- c.695, and according to the Heimskringla and the Hervarar saga also the king of Norway, Denmark, Saxony and parts of England. He began as king of Scania and conquered Sweden by defeating Ingjald Illråde. He is then said to have conquered all of Scandinavia and parts of England. Because of his harsh rule, many Swedes fled west and populated Wermelandia under its king Olof Trätälja. His last campaign was in Russia where he died, defeated by Odin in disguise. (Another source claims he took his life by drowning himself in the Gulf of Finland.)<br>
<br>
His homeland was Scania, but according to the Heimskringla and the Sögubrot, he had to flee Scania when his uncle Gudröd had slain his father Halfdan the Mild. Snorri Sturluson, Historia Norwegiae, Hervarar saga and Upplendinga Konungum tell that Ivar conquered Sweden after Ingjald's suicide, and later returned to take Denmark.<br>
<br>
According to Hversu Noregr byggdist, he was the son of Halfdan the Kind (also given as his father in the Heimskringla and the Hervarar saga), son of Harald the Old, son of Valdar, son of Roar (Hrođgar) of the house of Skjöldung (Scylding). According to Hversu, the Lay of Hyndla and Sögubrot, Ivar had a daughter named Aud.<br>
<br>
Sögubrot relates that when Ivar was the king of Sweden, he gave his daughter Aud to king Rörek of Zealand, in spite of the fact that she wanted to marry Rörek's brother Helgi. Rörek and Aud had the son Harald Hildetand. Ivar made Rörek kill his brother Helgi, and after this, he attacked and killed Rörek. However, Aud arrived with the Zealand army and chased her father Ivar back to Sweden. The following year, Aud went to Gardariki with her son Harald and many powerful men and married its king Radbart. This was the opportunity for Ivar to conquer Zealand. However, when he learnt that his daughter had married without his permission, he marshalled a great leidang from Denmark and Sweden and went to Gardariki. He was very old at the time. However, when they had arrived at the borders of Radbart's kingdom, Karelia (Karjálabotnar), he threw himself overboard. Harald then returned to Scania to become its ruler. In the Lay of Hyndla, Ivar, Aud, Rörek and Harald appear. Radbart also appears, but there is no information about his relationship with them.<br>
<br>
However, according to the Hervarar saga, his daughter was named Alfhild and she was married to Valdar whom Ivar made king of Denmark.<br>

His love of music began at the age of six when he taught himself to play the piano. He also learned to play the alto saxophone, guitar, and accordion. During high school (Dublin H.S. class of 1950), he formed a dance band and played for teen dances. For many years he and his high school buddies and life-long friends, Bob Billingsley and Eddie Ewing, played with the "Harmello Quintette" around the Columbus area. The band often played for weddings and parties and were always in well received. Throughout his lifetime he was joined by his close friends including Dick Seely, Jack Frambes, and Bernie Flynn at many of these gatherings. Later in life Milton began tuning pianos and was always in demand. Milton was billed as the youngest square dance caller in the State of Ohio at age 18. He called square dances for the Georgia Crackers for several years at the Smith Dance Gardens on 4th Street in Columbus. Milton also entertained the soldiers with his piano playing while stationed in Germany during his time in the U.S. Army.

He also worked in sales at Gabels Dairy, Sears and Robuck Co. in the Hardware Department and Smith Bros. Hardware, and Sherwin Williams. He was a loyal member of the Moose Lodge, the American Legion, and American Veterans. These associations along with his music, and his close friendships leave a legacy of entertaining and service.
