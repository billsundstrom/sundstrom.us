Catherine DE ROET
<p>
<a name ="I008255"><b>[I008255]</b></a><br />
Katherine (or Katharine or Catherine) (c. 1350 - 1403) was the daughter of Payne (or Paen) de Roet (or Rouet or Roelt) a Flemish herald from Hainault who was knighted just before dying in the wars, leaving Katherine and her older sister Philippa, as well as a brother, Walter, and eldest sister, Isabel (Elizabeth) de Roet, (who died chanoinness of the convent of St. Waudru's, Mons, c. 1366). About the year 1366, at the age of 16, Katherine married Hugh Swynford or Synford, an English knight from the manor of Kettlethorpe in Lincolnshire, and bore him at least two children (Blanch, Thomas, and likely the Margaret Swynford who was nominated a nun at the prestigious Barking Abbey by the command of Richard II in 1377) before he, too, died in the European wars. She then became attached to the household of John of Gaunt, Duke of Lancaster, ostensibly as governess to his two daughters (the sisters of the future Henry IV of England) by his first wife Blanche, but eventually she became his official mistress. Katherine's sister Philippa married the poet Geoffrey Chaucer, whose poem The Book of the Duchess commemorated Blanche's death in about 1369.<br>
<br>
Long after the death of his second wife Constance (or Constanza) of Castile, John and Katherine married in January 1396, three years before he died. The four children Katherine had borne John of Gaunt had been given the surname "Beaufort" and were already adults when they were legitimized (but barred from inheriting the throne by a clause inserted by half-brother Henry IV well into the latter's reign) in 1390:<br>
<br>
    * John Beaufort, 1st Earl of Somerset.<br>
    * Henry Cardinal Beaufort.<br>
    * Thomas Beaufort, 1st Duke of Exeter.<br>
    * Joan Beaufort, Countess of Westmorland.<br>
<br>
Her son John was the great-grandfather of Henry VII of England and the grandfather of James II of Scotland; her daughter Joan Beaufort was the grandmother of Edward IV of England and Richard III of England, whom Henry VII defeated to take the throne. (Henry then married Elizabeth of York, daughter of Edward IV, and their son became Henry VIII of England). Her step-son became Henry IV of England by deposing Richard II of England (who was imprisoned and died shortly thereafter, in Pontefract Castle, where Katherine's son Thomas Swynford was constable, and he was said to have starved Richard to death for his step-brother); her step-daughter, John and Constance's daughter Catherine (or Catalina), was the great-grandmother of Catherine of Aragon, the first wife of Henry VIII of England and mother of Mary I of England.<br>
<br>
Katherine survived John by only four years, dying on May 10, 1403. (Since she was then dowager Duchess of Lancaster, there was a record of the exact day, as there was not for her birth, when she was a nobody.) Her tomb, and that of her daughter Joan Beaufort, are under a carved-stone canopy in the sanctuary of Lincoln Cathedral, but their remains are no longer in them, because the tombs were despoiled in 1644, during the English Civil War, by the Roundheads.<br>
</p>
Everard DE ROS
<p>
<a name ="I016234"><b>[I016234]</b></a><br />
Everard de Ros, third Lord of Hamlake, who seems to have been very wealthy, as in 1176 he paid the then large sum of five hundred and twenty-six pounds as a fine for his lands, and other large amounts subsequently. He was born 1144, the son of Robert de Ros and Sybil de Valoines. Everard de Ros married Rose Trusbut. They had a child, Robert de Ros, Magna Charta Surety.<br>
</p>
Piers DE ROS
<p>
<a name ="I016238"><b>[I016238]</b></a><br />
PIERS DE ROS, a feudal Baron whose parentage is unknown, probably derived his name from Ros in Holderness, Yorks (East Riding). He was steward (dapifer) of the Count of Aumale, lord of Holderness. He gave 2 carucates of land in Gilling, near Helmsley, and the church to St. Mary's Abbey, York. He married Adeline, youngest of the 3 sisters and coheirs of Walter ESPEC, LORD OF HELMSLEY, &c., Yorks, and of Wark, Northumberland, founder of 3 monasteries---Kirkham (1122) and Rievaulx (1131) in Yorks, and Wardon, Beds (1135). Piers predeceased Walter Espec and was presumably dead in 1130. His widow also died before her brother. [Complete Peerage, XI:90]<br>

Piers de Ros (a name that seems to have been taken from Ros, Holderness, East Riding Yorks); steward to Count d'Aumale (feudal Lord of Holderness); married Adeline, 3rd and youngest sister and coheir of Walter Espec, feudal Lord of Helmsley, Yorks, and Wark, Northumberland. [Burke's Peerage]<br>
<br>
-----------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
"That Peter, the ancestor of this great and noble family," says Dugdale, "did originally assume his surname in the time of Henry I from that lordship in Holderness called Ros, where he then had his residence, needeth not to be doubted." This Peter de Ros, or Roos, a feudal baron, m. Adeline, one of the sisters and co-heirs of the famous Walter Espec, Lord of the manor of Helmesley, called sometimes Helmeslac, but oftener Hamlake, in the north riding of Yorkshire, and was s. at his decease by his son, Robert de Ros. [Sir Bernard Burke, Dormant, Abeyant, Forfeited and Extinct Peerages, Burke's Peerage, London, 1883, p. 458, Ros, or Roos, Barons Ros]<br>
</p>
Robert DE ROS
<p>
<a name ="I016230"><b>[I016230]</b></a><br />
Robert de Ros or Roos of Fursan (1177 - December 11, 1226) was the fourth baron by tenure of Hamlake manor (later associated with the barony of de Ros).<br>
<br>
He was the son of Everard de Ros and Rose Trusbut. In 1191, aged fourteen, he paid a thousand marks fine for livery of his lands to King Richard I of England. In 1191, he married Isabel Avenal, an illegitimate daughter of William the Lion, King of Scotland and Isabel Avenal. In 1197, while serving King Richard in Normandy, he was arrested for an unspecified offence, and was committed to the custody of Hugh de Chaumont, but Chaumont entrusted his prisoner to William de Spiney, who allowed him to escape from the castle of Bonville. King Richard thereupon hanged Spiney and collected a fine of twelve hundred marks from Ros' guardian as the price of his continued freedom.<br>
<br>
When King John came to the throne, he gave Ros the barony of his great-grandmother's father, Walter dʼEspec. Soon afterwards he was deputed one of those to escort William the Lion, his father-in-law, into England, to swear fealty to King John. Some years later, Robert de Ros assumed the habit of a monk, whereupon the custody of all his lands and Castle Werke, in Northumberland, were committed to Philip d'Ulcote, but he soon returned and about a year later he was High Sheriff of County Cumberland.<br>
<br>
When the struggle of the barons for a constitutional government began, de Ros at first sided with King John, and thus obtained some valuable grants from the crown, and was made governor of Carlisle; but he subsequently went over to the barons and became one of the celebrated twenty-five "Sureties" appointed to enforce the observance of Magna Carta, the county of Northumberland being placed under his supervision. He gave his allegiance to King Henry III and, in 1217-18, his manors were restored to him. Although he was witness to the second Great Charter and the Forest Charter, of 1224, he seems to have remained in royal favour.<br>
<br>
He erected Helmsley or Hamlake Castle in Yorkshire, and of Werke in Northumberland. Sir Robert is buried at Knightʼs Church, London. Among their children was Sir William de Ros.<br>
</p>
Robert DE ROS
<p>
<a name ="I016224"><b>[I016224]</b></a><br />
Robert de Ros, 1st Baron de Ros (c. 1223 - May 13, 1285), was an English nobleman and the first holder of the ancient title Baron de Ros.<br>
<br>
He was grandson to Robert de Ros and Isabel Avenal, an illegitimate daughter of William I of Scotland and an elder Isabel Avenal. He was son to William de Ros d. 1264/1265) and Lucy Fitzpiers, daughter of Reginald FitzPiers, Lord of Blewleveney.<br>
<br>
He was summoned to Parliament in 1264, during the reign of Henry III.<br>
<br>
He was married to Isabel D'Albini, rich heiress of William Albini IV. They reportedly had eight children:<br>
    * William de Ros, 2nd Baron de Ros (1255 - 1317).<br>
    * Isabel de Ros (c. 1244 - June 12, 1356. Married de Fauconberge.<br>
    * Mary de Ros (1245 - May 23, 1326). Married William de Braose, son of John de Braose and Margaret ap Llewellyn. Margaret was a daughter of Llywelyn the Great.<br>
    * Joan de Ros (c. 1252 - October 13, 1348). Married John Lovell, 1st Baron Lovell of Tichmarch.<br>
    * Avelina de Ros. Married Sir John de Bohun of Midhurst. Alleged eighth-generation ancestor of Daniel Boone.<br>
    * Robert de Ros (1265 - 1361). Married "Ernberge".<br>
    * John de Ros, Bishop of Carlisle (d. 1332).<br>
    * Nicholas de Ros.<br>
<br>
On July 3, 1257, Ros obtained from Henry III a grant of the free warren, in the lordship of Belvoir, by which the boundary was determined. In 1258, he was actively employed in Scotland, in delivering King Alexander III of Scotland out of the hands of his rebellious subjects; and at Chester, in resisting the hostile invasions of Llewelyn the Last. In the same year, he and his lady Isabel had a controversy with the Prior and Convent of Belvoir, relative to the right of presentation to the Church of Redmile (near Bottesford), which was amicably compromised by their relinquishing the patronage to the convent, for a certain compensation. In 1261 he obtained from the king the grant of a weekly market, to be held at Belvoir, on Tuesday; and of an annual fair on the feast of St John the Baptist, to continue for three days. In 1264, he was one of the insurgent barons who defeated Henry III at the battle of Lewes, and took him and the prince prisoner, confining them in Hungerford Castle. In 1264, de Ros was summoned to the parliament, which was called by the barons in the king's name. He died in 1285, and was buried at Kirkham.<br>
</p>
Robert DE ROS
<p>
<a name ="I016236"><b>[I016236]</b></a><br />
In the 3rd Henry II [1157], Robert de Ros paid 1,000 marks of silver to the king for livery of the lands inherited by his mother from her brother, Walter Espec. This Robert was a munificent benefactor to the Knights Templars. He married Sybell de Valoines (who, after his decease, m. Ralph de Albini) and dying sometime about the middle of the 12th century, was s. by his son, Everard de Ros, a minor. [Sir Bernard Burke, Dormant, Abeyant, Forfeited and Extinct Peerages, Burke's Peerage, London, 1883, p. 458, Ros, or Roos, Barons Ros]<br>

ROBERT DE ROS, brother and heir, confirmed (1147-53) to Rievaulx the gift of his uncle Walter Espec, for the souls of his said uncle his father and brother Everard. He was sometime constable, probably to the Count of Aumale, lord of Holderness. As Robert de Ros he attested a charter of Count William about 1150, and Henry II's charter to Scarborough, where, for several years from 1158, he was in charge of works at the King's castle. He married Sibyl DE VALOGNES, and died in 1162 or 1163. His widow married, 2ndly, circa 1166, William DE PERCY, who died probably in 1174 or 1175; and 3rdly, in 1181 or 1182, Ralph D'AUBIGNY (brother of William D'AUBIGNY of Belvoir), who died before Michaelmas 1192.

<br>
He married Margery De Badlesmere (1306-1363), the eldest sister and co-heir of Giles, Baron Badlesmere of Leeds Castle, county of Kent. She survived her husband by many years and was one of the very few English people present at the Jubilee, at Rome, in 1350; the king had tried to prevent the attendance of his subjects at this ceremony on account of the large sums of money usually taken out of the kingdom on such occasions.

    * Thomas de Ros, 5th Baron de Ros<br>
    * Sir John De Ros<br>

<br>
William 2nd Baron de Ros of Hamlake, Yorkshire, was one of the claimants of the crown of Scotland, in 1292, during the reign of Edward I, and was summoned to Parliament during the reigns of Edward I and Edward II. He succeeded to the family honours and estates on the death of his mother. He was an unsuccessful competitor for the crown of Scotland, founding his claim on his descent from his great grandmother, Isabel, a bastard daughter of William I of Scotland. He was buried at Kirkham Priory.<br>
<br>
His wife was Maud or Matilda de Vaux (b. 1275), whom he married in 1287.<br>
<br>

Humbert III DE SAVOIE
<p>
<a name ="I007521"><b>[I007521]</b></a><br />
From Wikipedia<br>
<br>
Humbert III (b. 1135 - d. 1189), surnamed the Blessed, was Count of Savoy from 1148 to 1189. According to Cope, "Humbert III, who reigned from 1149 to 1189...was a man of irresolute spirit who was disconsolate at being born a prince and preferred the seclusion of a monestery. He only renounced his chosen state of celibacy so as to give his land an heir."<br>
<br>
His first wife died young; his second marriage ended in divorce. Humbert gave up and became a Carthusian monk. However, the nobles and common people of Savoy begged him to marry yet again, which he reluctantly did. This third wife gave him two more daughters, and Humbert attempted to return to the monastic life yet again. Finally he was prevailed upon to marry for a fourth time, and this wife, Beatrice, produced the son who would ultimately succeed him.<br>
<br>
He married four times:<br>
   1. Faidiva (Italian) daughter of Alphonse I of Toulouse<br>
   2. Gertrude of Flanders, whom he divorced and confined. She was freed thanks to Robert, bishop of Cambrai and returned to the court of her brother, Philip of Flanders<br>
   3. Clemenza of Zähringen (married 1164), daughter of Conrad I of Zähringen. They had 2 daughters:<br>
       1. Sofia, (1165-1202), married Azzo IV of Este<br>
       2. Alicia, (1166-1178), betrothed to John of England<br>
   4. Beatrice of Viennois and had 1 son<br>
       1. Tommaso (born 1178)<br>
</p>
Adelaide DE SAVOY
<p>
<a name ="I007935"><b>[I007935]</b></a><br />
From Wikipedia<br>
<br>
Adelasia of Moriana (fr. Adélaide de Maurienne) (1092 - November 18, 1154) was the daughter of Humbert II of Savoy and Gisela of Burgundy, and niece of Pope Callistus II, who once visited her court in France. Her father died in 1103, and her mother married Rainier of Montferrat as a second husband.<br>
<br>
She became the second wife of Louis VI of France (1081-1137), whom she married on August 3, 1115. They had six children, the second of whom became Louis VII of France. She was reputed to be "ugly," but attentive and pious, and with Louis she had six sons and two daughters:<br>
   1. Philippe (1116-1131), not to be confused with his brother of the same name; died from a fall from a horse<br>
   2. Louis VII the Young (1120-1180), king of France.<br>
   3. Henri (1121-1175), bishop of Beauvais (1149-1161) and then of archbishop of Reims (1161-1175)<br>
   4. Hugues (c. 1123), died young<br>
   5. Robert I of Dreux (c. 1123-1188), called Robert the Great, count of Dreux (1137-1184), count of Perche<br>
   6. Constance (c. 1124-1180), married first (in 1140) Eustace IV of Boulogne, married second (in 1154) Raymond V of Toulouse<br>
   7. Philippe (c. 1125-1161), not to be confused with his elder brother; bishop of Paris<br>
   8. Pierre (c. 1125-c. 1182), married Elizabeth of Courtenay<br>
<br>
Afer Louis VI's death, Adélaide did not immediately retire to conventual life, as did most widowed queens of the time. Instead she married Matthieu I of Montmorency, with whom she had one child. She remained active in the French court and in religious activities.<br>
<br>
Adélaide is one of two queens in a legend related by William Dugdale. As the story goes, Queen Adélaide of France became enamoured of a young knight, William d'Albini, at a joust. But he was already engaged to Queen Adeliza of England and refused to become her lover. The jealous Adélaide lured him into the clutches of a hungry lion, but William ripped out the beast's tongue with his bare hands and thus killed it. This story is almost without a doubt apocryphal.<br>
<br>
In 1153 she retired to the abbey of Montmartre, which she had founded with Louis VII. She died there on November 18, 1154.<br>
</p>
Amadeus II DE SAVOY
<p>
<a name ="I007898"><b>[I007898]</b></a><br />
Amadeus II (d. 1080), Count of Savoy 1060-1080, jointly ruled with Peter until 1078). He married Joan (Giovanna in Italian) of Geneva and had three children:<br>
   1. Umberto<br>
   2. Adelaide (d. 1090)<br>
   3. Ausilia, married Umberto di Beaujeu<br>
</p>
Amadeus III DE SAVOY
<p>
<a name ="I007894"><b>[I007894]</b></a><br />
From Wikipedia<br>
<br>
Amadeus III of Savoy (1095-1148) was Count of Savoy and Maurienne from 1103 until his death.<br>
<br>
He was the son of Humbert II of Savoy and Gisela of Burgundy, daughter of William I of Burgundy, and succeeded as count on the death of his father. Amadeus had a tendency to exaggerate his titles, and also claimed to be duke of Lombardy, duke of Burgundy, duke of Chablais, and vicar of the Holy Roman Empire, the latter of which had been given to his father by Henry IV, Holy Roman Emperor.<br>
<br>
He helped restore the Abbey of St. Maurice of Augane, in which the former kings of Burgundy had been crowned, and of which he himself was abbott until 1147. He also founded the Abbey of St. Sulpicius in Bugey, the Abbey of Tamié in the Bauges, and the Abbey of Hautecombe on the Lac du Bourget.<br>
<br>
He had no children with his first wife Adelaide. In 1123 he married Mahaut (or Mafalda, or Matilda) of Albon, the sister of Guy IV of Dauphinois, with whom he had 10 children:<br>
       1. Elisa of Savoy (1120-?) married Humberto of Beaujeu<br>
       2. Mafalda (Mahaut), (b. 1125 - d. 1158), married Alfonso I of Portugal<br>
       3. Agnes of Savoy (1125-1172), married William I, Count of Geneva<br>
       4. Humbert III (1136-1188)<br>
       5. John of Savoy<br>
       6. Peter of Savoy<br>
       7. William of Savoy<br>
       8. Margaret of Savoy (died 1157)<br>
       9. Isabella of Savoy<br>
      10. Juliana of Savoy (died 1194), abbess of St. André-le-Haut<br>
<br>
In 1128, Amadeus extended his realm, known as the "Old Chablais", by adding to it the region extending from the Arve to the Dranse d'Abondance, which came to be called the "New Chablais" with its capital at St. Moritz. Despite his marriage to Mahaut, he still fought against his brother-in-law Guy, who was killed at the Battle of Montmeillan. Following this, king Louis VI of France, married to Amadeus' sister Adélaide de Maurienne, attempted to confiscate Savoy. Amadeus was saved by the intercession of Peter the Hermit, and by his promise to participate in Louis' planned crusade.<br>
<br>
In 1147, he accompanied his nephew Louis VII of France and his wife Eleanor of Aquitaine on the Second Crusade. He financed his expedition with help from a loan from the Abbey of St. Maurice. In his retinue were many barons from Savoy, including the lords of Faucigny, Seyssel, La Chambre, Miolans, Montbel, Thoire, Montmayeur, Vienne, Viry, La Palude, Blonay, Chevron-Villette, Chignin, and Châtillon. Amadeus travelled south through Italy to Brindisi, where he crossed over to Durazzo, and marched east along the Via Egnatia to meet Louis at Constantinople in late 1147. After crossing into Anatolia, Amadeus, who was leading the vanguard, became separated from Louis near Laodicea, and Louis' forces were almost entirely destroyed.<br>
<br>
Marching on to Adalia, Louis, Amadeus, and other barons decided to continue to Antioch by ship. On the journey, Amadeus fell ill on Cyprus, and died at Nicosia in April of 1148. He was buried in the Church of St. Croix in Nicosia. In Savoy, his son Humbert III succeeded him, under the regency of bishop Amadeus of Lausanne.<br>

From Wikipedia<br>
<br>
Thomas I or Tommaso I (1178 - March 1, 1233) was Count of Savoy from 1189 - 1233. He was the son of Humbert III of Savoy and Beatrice of Viennois. His birth was seen as miraculous; his monkish father had despaired of having a male heir after three wives. Count Humbert sought counsel from St. Anthelm, who blessed Humbert three times, and it was seen as a prophecy come true when Thomas was born shortly after Anthelm himself died on June 26, 1178. He was named in honor of St. Thomas Becket.<br>
<br>
Thomas possessed the martial abilities, energy, and brilliance that his father lacked, and Savoy enjoyed a golden age under his leadership. He had taken over effective rule of Savoy by August 1191, and despite his youth he began the push north-west into new territories. He conquerored Vaud, Bugey, and Carignano. He supported the Hohenstaufens, and was known as "Thomas the Ghibelline" due to his career as Imperial Vicar of Lombardy.<br>
<br>
In 1195 he ambushed the party of Count William I of Geneva, which was escorting the count's daughter, Marguerite, to France for her intended wedding to King Philip II of France. Thomas carried off Marguerite and married her himself, producing some eight sons and six daughters.<br>

Umberto I DE SAVOY
<p>
<a name ="I007907"><b>[I007907]</b></a><br />
Humbert I (Hubert de Maurienne in French, Umberto I Biancamano di Moriana in Italian and in official documents, born in 980 - died at Hermillon in 1047 or 1048) became the first count of the House of Savoy, which ruled Savoy throughout its independent existence and furnished the monarchs of Italy after the unification.<br>
<br>
Surnamed Biancamano (literally meaning white-handed - in the original sense this should have meant a very generous man), Humbert came of noble stock from either Saxony, Italy, Burgundy or Provence.<br>
<br>
Humbert married Ancilla, or Auxilia or Ancilia (Austrian, daughter of the Master of Ceremonies of the House of Burgundy) and had at least four sons:<br>
   1. Amedeo, later Amedeus I of Savoy<br>
   2. Aimone (died 1054 or 1055), bishop of Sion<br>
   3. Burcado, or Burcardo (died 1068 or 1069), bishop of Lyons<br>
   4. Oddone<br>
Some authors believe that he had further sons.<br>
<br>
During the campaigns of Rudolph of Burgundy to make Rome the imperial seat, Humbert supported the Emperor (of which family he was an adherent by marriage) with provisions and soldiers. Thus Rudolph installed him in 1003 as the count of the mountainous region of Aosta and of the northern Viennois as a reward.<br>
<br>
Humbert in turn protected the right flank during the advance of the Holy Roman Empire into Italy. However the county was essentially autonomous after the fall of the Ottonian Dynasty of the Holy Roman Empire which was unconcerned about a minor power.<br>
<br>
In 1032 he received the Maurienne, his native county, from Conrad II the Salian whom he had helped in his Italian campaigns against archbishop Aribert of Milan.<br>

Picot DE SAY
<p>
<a name ="I016300"><b>[I016300]</b></a><br />
"Cil de Saie," mentioned by Wace in his account of the battle of Hastings, took his name from the vill of Saium or Say, about nine miles to the west of Exmes, the caput of Roger de Montgomeri's Norman Viscountcy, and held under Roger in Normandy, as he afterwards did in England. He is known as Picot de Say, for Ficot, or Picot, at first a sobriquet only, is given as his recognised appellation in Domesday; thought the son and grandson that inherited his barony were always styled De Say. There is still extant the charter by which he, with his wife Adeloya, and his two sons, Robert and Henry, bestowed lands in 1060 on the Abbey founded by his suzerain at Seez. He came over to England in Roger's train; and was one of those to whom, according to Orderic, the new Earl 'gave commands' in Shorpshire. Twenty-nine manors wre allowed to him; and Clun, as the largest of them, gave its name to his bariony. In 1083, he, with the other principal men of the country, was summoned to attend at the dedication of Shrewsbury Abbey. His son Henry succeeded him, and was followed in the next generation by Helias.

    Picot, who was a substantial under-tenant of Earl Roger of Montgomery at Clun and elsewhere in Shropshire, is shown by the devolution of his lands to have been Picot de Say. Robert, Abbot of St-Martin de Sees granted the privilege of burial to Robert and Henry their sons; and in return Picot (as he is henceforth called) and his wife gave to the abbey "edificium matris Picot cum virgulto quod habebat juxta ecclesiam sancte Marie de Vrou" and confirmed a third of the church of Sai which Osmelinus de Sayo gave at the same time, giving also meadow land in the meadows "de Juvigneio"; the charter is subscribed by Earl Roger, Picot and his wife and two sons. "Vrou" is clearly Urou, the next parish to Sai, and Juvigni the parish immediately south of Sai. An agreement was made on 17 May 1086 in the court of Robert de Belleme between Picot de Saio and Droco de Coimis as to the dower which Droco's brother William had given to Adeloia his wife, who had been remarried to Picot. This is further evidence of Picot's tenure under the house of Montgomery-Belleme, and suggests that the charter to St-Martin de Sees was considerably later than 1060, the date to which it has been assigned.

    The first member of the family of Say mentioned by Sir William Dugdale is Picot de Say, who, in the time of the Conqueror, and living in 1083, was one of the principal persons in the co. Salop under Roger de Montgomery, Earl of Shrewsbury. The next is Ingelram de Say, one of the staunchest adherents of King Stephen in his contest with the Empress Maud, and made prisoner with the monarch at the battle of Lincoln. After this gallant and faithful solder, we come to William de Say, son of William de Say, and grandson, of William de Say, who came into England with the Conqueror.

    He (Cadwgan) married a daughter of Robert of Sai, a Norman Baron (Lord of Clun) and his wife, Adeloya. Robert was variously called Robert de Sai, which was his correct name, Ficot de Saium and Picot de Say. His estate was sitmacted in the valley of the Clun fiver in south-wester Shropshire and it was very extensive, including nearly all of Rinlau Hundred and a large part of Rinteurde Hundred. Cadwgan had seven sons, but only the fifth, Henry, and the sixth, Gruffyd, were by his wife, the daughter of Lord Robert de Sai. Each of the others was by a different mother and probably illegitimate according to modern standards. [The Weaver Genealogy]<br>
