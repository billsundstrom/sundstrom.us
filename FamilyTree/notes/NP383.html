MUSKEGON -- A 96-year-old Muskegon woman was found dead in the kitchen of her home after firefighters forced entry Thursday night as smoke poured from the structure. <br>
A family member identified the victim as Isabella Flickema , who lived alone. The fire was reported around 9:53 p.m. <br>
Fire Marshal Major Metcalf said Friday that Flickema , who was sight and hearing-handicapped, was found just inside the entryway from the dining room to the kitchen. <br>
"Right now, it appears that the fire started in the northeast corner of a kitchen wall, and it appears to have been electrical," he said, adding that the wiring in the home was old. <br>
A neighborhood couple leaving the gas station across the street saw smoke coming from the one-story house. They said it looked like too much smoke to be from a chimney. <br>
"We thought we should drive by," said Michelle LeMieux, 31. She and Christopher Place, 30, saw the house was dark. They stopped their vehicle and he began pounding on the front door. <br>
"It sounded like a TV was going inside," Place said, but no one answered the door. He said he knocked on the windows and went to the back door. <br>
"The paint on the back door was starting to pucker and a window was gone from the heat," he said. "I was hoping no one was inside." <br>
Mark Kincaid, deputy public safety director for fire services, said when firefighters arrived they were told an elderly woman lived there and that no one knew if she was home. A primary search was conducted and the victim, dressed in a nightgown and slippers, was discovered. <br>
Metcalf said it looked as if she "rolled her bedcovers back to get up and walked to the kitchen," where she probably inhaled smoke and superheated gases. <br>
The fire marshal estimated from the amount of damage and the fire patterns coming from the area where the blaze started that the fire could have been burning in the wall for some time. "By the time she got to the kitchen, the fire had broken through the wall," he said. <br>
Although fire officials at first believed there were no smoke detectors in the home, the victim's son indicated there was an alarm in the dining room area. <br>
Metcalf said the woman had a lifeline-type alarm that is activated by pushing a button and she also had a police scanner. While the television set was off when he arrived, Metcalf said the noise the couple heard could have come from either the scanner or someone on the other end of the help line. <br>
