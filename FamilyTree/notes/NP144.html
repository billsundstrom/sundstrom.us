Berenger I DI FRIULI
<p>
<a name ="I005413"><b>[I005413]</b></a><br />
From Wikipedia<br>
<br>
Berengar of Friuli (? - 16 April 924) was a Margrave of Friuli, King of Italy (from 888 on) and Emperor of the Holy Roman Empire from 915 on.<br>
<br>
Berengar I originated from the Carolingians on his mother's side. He was the son of Gisela, a daughter of Louis the Pious, and Eberhard, the Margrave of Friuli.<br>
<br>
His older brother Unroch III died before his time and Berengar succeeded him as margrave of Friuli around 874. With this his obtained a key position, as the margrave bordered the Slavs and Magyars who where threatening the Italian peninsula. In 888, Berengar succeeded in convincing the Italian nobility to proclaim him King of Italy, even though there certainly were other options for the title. His rival, Guy of Spoleto, tried to outmaneuver him by having Pope Stephen VI crown him Emperor, as well as crowning both him and his son Lambert of Spoleto as King. The coronation was considered controversial because Guy was known to be an archrival of the Pope. Nevertheless, Guy succeeded in restoring order in Italy from his bases in Pavia and Rome. Fortunately for Berengar, Pope Formosus invited King Arnulf of the East Franks to Italy in 893 to overthrow Guy. Arnulf sent his illegitimate son Zwentibold, who met up with Berengar. Together, they cornered Guy at Pavia, but did not press their advantage (it is believe that Guy bribed them off). The following year, Arnulf and Berengar defeated Guy at Bergamo and took control of Pavia and Milan. Guy died in 894. His son, Emperor Lambert, defeated an attempt by Berengar to advance on Pavia in 898, but died in a hunting accident days later. Meanwhile, Arnulf, who had been crowned in 896 in opposition to Lambert, had left Italy that same year. It seemed that Berengar would quickly regain his authority.<br>
<br>
Outside events would change this, however. Chaos had struck as the first Magyar invasions had commenced and Berengar's defeat at their hands near the Brenta river in 899 caused the nobility to question his ability to protect Italy. As a result, they supported another candidate for the throne, Louis of Provence. In 900 Louis marched into Italy and defeated Berengar; the following year he was crowned King and Emperor by Pope Benedict IV. In 902, however, Berengar struck back and defeated Louis, making him promise not to return to Italy. When he broke this oath by invading the peninsula again in 905, Berengar again defeated him at Verona, captured him, and ordered him to be blinded. Louis returned to Lower Burgundy and ruled for another twenty years as Louis the Blind. Berengar thereby cemented his position as king.<br>
<br>
In January 915, Pope John X, after forging an alliance between Berengar and the local Italian rulers, crowned Berengar as Emperor, hoping he could face the Saracen threat in the south of Italy. However, Berengar returned swiftly to the north where Friuli was still threatened by the Magyars. Dissatisfied with the emperor, several Italian nobles invited Rudolf II of Upper Burgundy to take the Italian throne in 922. Moreover, his own son-in-law, the Margrave of Ivrea, rose up against him, incited by Rudolf. Berengar retreated to Verona and had to watch sidelined as the Magyars pillaged the country. Pavia was sacked in 924, and the same year Berengar was murdered by one of his own men, possibly at the instigation of Rudolf.<br>
<br>
There exists an anonymous writing, 'Gesta Berengarii Imperatoris', about the many happenings of his troublesome time.<br>

Eberhard DI FRIULI
<p>
<a name ="I007796"><b>[I007796]</b></a><br />
Eberhard (c. 815 - 16 December 866) was the Frankish Duke of Friuli from 846. His name is alternatively spelled Everard, Evrard, Erhard, or Eberard; in Latinized fashion, Everardus, Eberardus, or Eberhardus. He wrote his own name "Evvrardus".[1] He was an important political, military, and cultural figure in the Carolingian Empire during his lifetime. He kept a large library, commissioned works of Latin literature from Lupus Servatus and Sedulius Scottus, and maintained a correspondence with the noted theologians and church leaders Gottschalk, Rabanus Maurus, and Hincmar.<br>

Sigelgaita DI SALERNO
<p>
<a name ="I007681"><b>[I007681]</b></a><br />
From Wikipedia<br>
<br>
Sikelgaita (1040-April 16, 1090) was a Lombard princess, the second wife of Robert Guiscard.<br>
<br>
She was the daughter of Guiamarius IV, prince of Salerno. She married Robert in 1058, after Robert divorced his first wife Alberada due to supposed consanguinity. Her sister had earlier married Robert's half-brother Drogo. In 1060 she gave birth to Roger Borsa, and sometime later she gave birth to a second son, Guy, as well as a daughter, Maud, who married Ramon Berenguer II, Count of Barcelona.<br>
<br>
Sikelgaita frequently accompanied Robert on his conquests. Although at first she tried to persuade him not to attack the Byzantine Empire, she accompanied him on his campaign against them as well. At the Battle of Dyrrhachium she fought in full armour, rallying Robert's troops when they were initially repulsed by the Byzantine army. According to the Byzantine chronicler Anna Comnena, she was "like another Pallas, if not a second Athena," and Anna attributes to her a quote from the Iliad.<br>
<br>
In 1083 Sikelgaita returned to Italy with Robert to defend the Pope against Holy Roman emperor Henry IV. She accompanied him on a second campaign against the Byzantines, during which Robert died on Corfu in 1085 with Sikelgaita at his side. Supposedly, she tried to poison Robert's son by his first wife, Bohemund of Taranto, although the two eventually came to an agreement by which Roger Borsa was allowed to succeed Robert.<br>

<a name ="I016802"><b>[I016802]</b></a><br />

Ximene DIAZ
<p>
<a name ="I008001"><b>[I008001]</b></a><br />
Jimena Diaz of Asturias was born circa 1055. Died after 1113. Jim's family is a mystery. Could also be a mystery at the same time he lived it. In the opinion of Maria Emma Escobar, in this family is odd, because the data that we know do not fit together, as if in his life he had wanted to cover something weird. His parents were Diego Fernández (as shown by documentation of the Cathedral of Oviedo), Count of Oviedo, and Cristina. Paternal grandfather: Ruy Alonso. Maternal grandparents: Fernando Gundemariz (the son of the Count of Oviedo skull, Gondemar Pinióliz) and according to some, Jimena de León (who died after 1037 and was the daughter of Alfonso V, king of León and Urraca of Navarre: see Kings Kings of Leon and Navarra). Fernando's parents were Gondemar Gundemariz Pinióliz (1012) and Mumadona (a holy woman who his son Fernando, a wealthy scoundrel, he only dislikes). Paternal grandparents: some mention Pinolo Jiménez (969 to 1-II-1049/50, son of Jinen Jiménez and Aragonta) and Alonso Muniz (7-III-163/64, daughter of Munio Rodrı́guez). Maria Emma Escobar argues that no evidence anywhere that Fernando was married Gundemariz Jimena de León (daughter of the king of León). Fernando was married to the Galician Mumadona Ordoñez, daughter of Ordoño Ramı́rez (son of Ramiro III, king of Leon) and Cristina de Leon (daughter of Vermudo II). It appears that the confusion stems from Jimena Alfonso VI called "Suprino", something like a niece or cousin, but it is likely that this was because she probably descended from the Infanta Cristina, daughter of Vermudo II and half-sister of Alfonso V. Maria Emma Escobar also clarifies that Gondemar Pinióliz was not the son of Piniolo Jiménez. That was a mistake committed inconceivable that Menéndez Pidal, as is the nephew Piniolo Gondemar Jiménez Pinióliz: Aragonta Gondemar and his sister were children of Piniolo Pinióliz Gundemariz. Jimeno Jiménez Aragonta married and were parents of Piniolo Jiménez.<br>
