BRUCE JAMES LAMB - WATERVILLE - Bruce James Lamb, 55, lost his life on March 21, 2012, in a work related accident, while energizing an electric line on a utility pole. Bruce was born on July 23, 1956, the first child of Caroline (Thompson) and William Lamb Jr., at Mary Fletcher Hospital (FAHC) in Burlington. He attended elementary and junior high school in Stowe, playing every sport available. In 1970, at age 14, his family moved to Johnson, where he entered his freshman year at Lamoille Union High School in Hyde Park. During his years at LUHS, he played baseball, basketball and soccer. He was an honor student and graduated in 1974. After graduation he worked in Stowe, at Mt. Mansfield, on the lift lines. He enrolled at Vermont Technical School and worked part time in carpentry and at Vermont Electric Co-operative. On March 27, 1979, he began his full-time employment at V.E.C., as a lineman. He was a member of the IBEW Local 300 and served as Shop Steward. On March 27, 1981, he married Malo Hemenway in Waterville, in the house that has remained their home for 31 years. They have a son and two daughters. Over the years in Waterville, he has held positions in town offices and coached many children in numerous sports. Bruce was a true "Family Man." He loved being Big Brother, Provider, Husband and Dad. He enjoyed the woods; hunting, sugaring and backyard gardening. There were always domestic pets and everything from pigs, horses and cows in the barn. A new arrival was always considered a blessing. He enjoyed people dropping by to visit, needing something fixed or to borrow an item. He was a friend to all and a "Stand-in Dad" or "Uncle Bruce" to numerous youngsters. He had an inner skill to right a wrong and make it okay. His smile always made you feel better. Bruce is survived by his wife, Malo; children, Justin, Jessica, and Torri; his mom, Caroline, and dad, Bill; four brothers, Bill III (Lisa), Bart, Brian, and Lance; sister, Linda (Rick); great-aunt, Harriett Durett of Stowe; aunt, Millie (Lamb) and her husband, J. Alain Paquette (also a fellow lineman, ret.), of Morrisville; numerous nieces, nephews and cousins; mother-in-law, Joyce; and two sisters-in-law, Loralei and Mary. Bruce was a member of an extended family at V.E.C. The linemen are brothers; always there for support, watching each others' back while tending line and equipment, talking and listening during travel and down time. During emergencies, these men spend more time together than with their families at home. The others, male and female, that occupy offices, maintain vehicles, or are multi-tasking are an integral part of this family. They should all be applauded for their time and effort. At this time, if you come in touch with anyone from V.E.C., please extend your hand and speak with them for a moment. Tell them that you appreciate them and are sorry for the loss of a brother (this includes retirees). Bruce was predeceased by his grandparents, Grace and Clifton Thompson of Stowe; and Anna and William Lamb of Johnson; aunts, uncles and cousins; nephew, Alexander; and father-in-law, Hubert. At his request no visiting hours or services have been held. <br>
