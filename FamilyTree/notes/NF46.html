An event ever interesting to young persons took place on Wednesday evening, Dec.28th, at the handsome residence of George Bowles Esq., Grafton, when his daughter, Laura Burgess ("Birdie"), a charming and popular young lady, was married to George Lovett Bishop, of Greenwich. The hour for the wedding was 6:30 O'clock. Rev. John Hawley, assisted by Rev. A.P.Logan, (of Bedford) officiated. The house is one which lends itself effectively to floral decorations. The parlours were certainly very attractive in their dress of fern, potted plants, and garlands of ribbon and holly. The bride, looking very lovely, entered with her father; her cousin, Mrs Burgess MacMahon, rendering on the piano, as the bridal party, ushered by Miss Linda Woodroffe, entered the drawing room and took their places under a floral arch of green and white, the wedding march from Mendelsohn, and at the conclusion of the ceremony, the bridal chorus from Lohengrin. The bride was beautifully gowned in white taffeta silk with chiffon trimmings and veil, and white hyacinths, and was attended by her sisters, Jessie and Nellie; the former being attired in a gown of mauve silk, the latter in nile green silk. Both gowns were trimmed with white silk and chiffon trimmings. The groom was attended by his brother, Leslie. The ceremony was followed by a reception and supper when friends had an opportunity of extending congratulations. Later, Mr and Mrs Bishop left for their home in Greenwich. There was a large and valuable collection of wedding gifts. A few of the many were a dinner set, from her family; a cut glass berry set, Mr & Mrs James B. Murray; a substantial cheque from the groom's sister in Portland, Oregan; another from the bride's brother in Fargo, North Dakota; a jersey handled carving set, Mr and Mrs A. McN. Patterson; large mantle clock, Mr and Mrs A.K. Forsyth; parlour table, Mr and Mrs A.F. Newcomb; besides china and silverware from numerous other friends.<br>
