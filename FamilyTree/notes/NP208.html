<a name ="I017222"><b>[I017222]</b></a><br />
What can you say about the best thing to ever happen to you?  The greatest joy I have ever had other than my childrenʼs birth, is the time that I spent with Ed.  I guess in a lot of ways according to the world standards we were strange!  Believe it or not I totally and completely enjoyed being with my husband for any reason and for any amount of time.  <br>
We had so much in common and what we did not have in common, we were both willing to do things the other would like.  I learned to like, not love but like football.  I could even make meaningful comments about the games! <br>
Family - There was nothing that was more important to Ed than his family, parents, childʼs, grandkids, and siblings.  He would ALWAYS go the extra mile for his family.  He was a devoted son to his Mom.  He loved her very much.  I saw big changes in Ed in the years that we were together.  Physical affection for him came tough for a long time.  I think it is safe to say that in the last handful of years he had changed a lot in that area.  He was not afraid to show someone that he cared about them.  I think his kids would totally agree with that.  There was nothing more special then seeing Ed with his pride and joy, his grandkids, all 10 of them!  He loved everyone very much and tried very hard to show that to them every time he would see them. <br>
NASCAR - He loved his NASCAR.  Ed started watching and going to circle track races as a boy in Elko.  He loved watching every week and looking facts up on the internet.  I learned to like NASCAR too!!  <br>
NHRA - (drag racing) in his time at Fort Hood Texas he attend many drag races, not NHRA events, but it got the juices flowing for years later when we would start attending the NHRA events in Brainerd and we even got to go to the US Nationals in Indianapolis!!  That was a great time!  <br>
We had big plans for the future, but God had a different plan for Ed.  His time here on earth was oh, too short!  But, the time he had on earth was, for the most part lived to the fullest!<br>
I will miss him forever, no matter what the rest of my life has in store for me!  He was my true love!! <br>
