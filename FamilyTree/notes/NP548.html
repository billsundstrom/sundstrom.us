Maria Domenica TORTORA
<p>
<a name ="I044572"><b>[I044572]</b></a><br />
MARY BASCIANO, nee Maria Domenica Tortora, 84, passed away April 15, 2005. Mary began her volunteer career in Queens, New York as a volunteer driver for Cerebral Palsy and the Police Athletic League, a Girl Scout leader, PTA member and Secretary, President of the Flushing Suburban Civic Association, and member of the Jamaica Methodist Church. She was a loving mother and wife: the consummate nurturer. A natural green-thumb she loved to garden. Mary was very proud to have worked until she was 74 years of age receiving a commendation from the Florida State Department for her service.<br>
As a tireless champion of the less fortunate Mary (and husband Pete) devoted countless hours to Palm Beach County Special Olympics, actively participating in numerous programs. Much of her last 15 years were energetically devoted to helping with Special Olympics, Very Special Arts and the Palm Beach County Sheriff's Office programs for the handicapped. When asked about the source of her boundless energy, which was greatly appreciated by all the people she touched, she would often quote the 121 Psalm, "I will lift up mine eyes unto the hills, from whence cometh my help. My help cometh from the Lord which made heaven and earth." No job was too heavy when it came to helping her kids. She always gave enthusiastically and without measure. Mary was a Lifetime member of the Friends of the Retarded and ardent supporter of the Palm Beach Habilitation Center.<br>
She is survived by her loving husband Peter S. Basciano Sr.; her son Dr. Peter S. Basciano; her daughter and son-in-law Joyce (Basciano) and Gregory Tipple; grandchildren Leah, Vincent and Dean Basciano; her sisters Anna Catania, Antoinette Benedict and Josephine Fernandez, and many nieces, nephews, grandnieces and grandnephews. She is preceded in death by her parents Agostino and Antoinetta Tortora, brother Peter Tortora and sister Leonora Paolicelli.<br>
In lieu of flowers, memorial contributions may be made to the Palm Beach Habilitation Center, 4522 South Congress Avenue, Lake Worth, FL 33461. A memorial service will be held at TILLMAN FUNERAL HOME, 2170 South Military Trail, West Palm Beach on Tuesday, April 19, 2005 at 2:30PM with Reverend Joseph Catrambone officiating.<br>

Mr. Travis had relieved C. E. Bailey, crossing tender at the Water street Crossing at 4 o'clock yesterday afternoon and he worked until 6 o'clock when the night man came on duty.

Grace E. (Betty) Perry , 93, wife of the late Francis F. Perry , passed away peacefully at home while surrounded by her beloved family and the comfort of God, on Saturday evening, March 31, 2012.<br>
Born in Beverly on May 19, 1918, Betty and her husband Frank, lived and raised their family in Boxford for over 50 years, prior to her move to Middleton.<br>
In her younger days, Betty was an avid hiker and camper. As her family grew, her passions turned towards boating and enjoying the beach every weekend during the summer. She loved the water, and nothing kept her from swimming, no matter how cold the temperature was. While her children matured, she began selling Avon products to friends and neighbors. Although she was super salesperson, talking with and caring for her customers came first.<br>
The word 'Family' meant everything to Betty. As a member of the Trefry clan, Betty was devoted to her twelve brothers and sisters, whom she helped raise and nuture during the Great Depression. For years, she often entertained and spent time with her friends and loved ones nearly every weekend. She selflessly showed hospitality to others and strived to make all feel part of her family.<br>
A thoughtful, giving, and loving person, Betty was a matriarch in every sense of the word. She was always caring for others and offering her help. Although she is now gone, the gift of her life and love, which she gave to so many, will always be an inspiration and felt in our hearts and minds. Betty was a blessed woman and we were all blessed to have known her.<br>
Surviving her are two daughters, Carol Lemire and her husband, Philip of Topsfield and Robin Lynch and her husband, Jim of New Hampshire; two sons, Fred Perry Jr. and his wife, Cheryl of New Hampshire and Daniel Perry and his wife, Carol of Florida; 14 grandchildren, 27 great grandchildren and many nieces and nephews. She was also the mother of the late Evelyn "Bunnie" Lynch, grandmother of the late Danny Lynch and sister of the late Rowena Yudow, Genevieve Yudow, Carol Nelson, Naomi Trefry, Ethel Nash, Edith Berdge, Curt, Alfred, Jack, Ernest, Robert and Donald Trefry.<br>
