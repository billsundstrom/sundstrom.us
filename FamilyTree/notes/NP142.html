The Historical Society Museum is located at 55 Cayuga Street in Seneca Falls, NY in a house with a long and varied history. The first structure was built in 1823 as a one room wooden house. Edward Mynderse , son of the early land developer Colonel Wilhelmus Mynderse , erected a two-story brick structure in the Italianate Style circa 1855 on the site. The building was part of a ten acre estate with carriage house, tool shed, vineyard, garden and orchard. The Mynderse Family lived there until 1875 when Mrs. Leroy Partridge purchased the house and began an extensive remodeling and updating that changed the two story dwelling into the three stories,23 room, Queen Anne Style home that you see today. Architectural and decorative details which were added , include painted and stained glass windows, gas lights, carved fireplaces and the entire third floor. The mansion was sold to the Norman Becker Family in 1890 , which raised six children in the house. The Beckers lived there until 1961, when the Historical Society bought the building. The house as we see it today has undergone no major changes since the 1880's. It is a beautiful product of the late Victorian era and as such, is a marvelous document of Victorian lifestyle and culture.<br>

Minnedosa (Tannerʼs Crossing) Metis Scrip Applications<br>
Tannerʼs Crossing is situated on the Carlton Trail between Fort Garry and Fort Edmonton.<br>
Travelers enter the Little Saskatchewan Valley through a narrow eastern passwhere they descend one hundred and seventy-five feet to the valley floor.<br>
In 1869, JohnTanner Jr. built a ferry across the Little Saskatchewan River on the Carlton Trail. He alsooperated a store and post office at this location. The Tanners were one of four originalMetis families to settle in this area. The heads of the four families were John Norquay,George Sanderson, Peter Sinclair and John Tanner. The area was a centuries old trappingand hunting area for the bison that wintered at Riding Mountain and moved down thevalley to the plains in the summer. In 1877, Tanner and J.S. Armitage accumulated landand laid out a townsite in the river valley. Armitage changed the name to Minnedosa in1883.<br>

North Dakota Metis who Took Scrip<br>
Itinerant Metis groups from Michigan, Wisconsin and Minnesota had beentravelling across the Northern USA as far as the west coast since the early 1700s.Long before the Treaty of Ghent in 1814 set the border line between the USA andCanada, the Metis people crisscrossed the Old Northwest as guides, hunters, traders and freighters. Traders such as Jean Baptiste Dorion (1800-1899) worked in the south for the American Fur Company along the Missouri River and for the Hudsonʼs Bay Company along the North Saskatchewan River. Elizabeth Dumont (1790-1850) was a member of the Pesew Band of Mountain Cree in what is now Alberta. In 1826 at St. Louis Missouri she married trader Antoine Clement (1765-1848). In 1804, he was working for the NorthWest Company at Fort des Prairies; two years later he accompanied David Thomson across the Rocky Mountains travelling on both sides of the border to the west coast and subsequently worked for the Rocky Mountain Fur Company. After 1821 the couple moved to a small farm outside St. Ferdinand de Florestant just northwest of St. Louis, Missouri. Thus they had children born on both sides of what was to become the border. Thus by the time the "Medicine Line" was established the Metis had well-established roots both north and south of the line. Many were born in western French and Spanish Territory before the USA made the Louisiana Purchase. Many children of buffalo hunting brigades were not sure which country they were born in.<br>
