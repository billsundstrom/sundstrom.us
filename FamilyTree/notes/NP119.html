William Henry DAVIS
<p>
<a name ="I102912"><b>[I102912]</b></a><br />
Virginia Beach - Mr. William Henry Davis was peacefully carried into the arms of Jesus the morning of July 31, 2014 with his family by his side and rays of sunlight beaming into the room. Mr. Davis was born to William W. and Rosa M. Davis of Princess Anne County in 1925 and was a lifelong resident of rural Virginia Beach. He proudly served his country in the Army during World War II in Okinawa, Japan; and was a member of the Back Bay VFW Post 1211. He retired from the US government and City of Virginia Beach. He loved to garden and share his delicious vegetables with family, friends and neighbors and took great pride in keeping his lawn in tip-top shape. He enjoyed travel seeing new sights and cities especially on bus trips or anytime someone else was doing the driving. He loved to talk, never meeting a stranger. He will be greatly missed by his family and friends for his gentle spirit, his smile, sense of humor, love of laughter, common sense and his devilish little grin when he was sneaking that second bowl of homemade ice cream. <br>
Left to cherish his memory is the love of his life for 66 years, Evelyn Frances Davis; son, Thomas Leonard Davis (Lorine); daughter Joan Davis Harper (Keith); four grandsons, David Livers, John Livers (Natalie), Justin Davis (Katy), and Kyle Davis (Elisabeth); and four great-grandchildren, Brittany, Liam, Reed, Reilly.Beside his great love of family, he felt his greatest accomplishment was serving His Lord through various ministries at Oak Grove Baptist Church where he was bestowed the title of Deacon Emeritus for serving its members 40+ years, particularly ministering to the sick. The family appreciates the love and kindnesses of many friends and loved ones and is especially grateful for the support and caring given from the staff of Chesapeake Place Assisted Living and the Hospice and Palliative Care of Tidewater. A funeral service will be held Monday, August 4, 2014 at 11 a.m. at Oak Grove Baptist Church, 691 Princess Anne Road, Virginia Beach with Rev. Chuck Moseley and Dr. Ken Barnes officiating. He will be laid to rest with military honors in the church cemetery followed by a reception in the church fellowship hall. The family will receive friends at Graham Funeral Home on Sunday, August 3, 2014 from 3 to 4:30 p.m. <br>

Alfred DAY
<p>
<a name ="I070914"><b>[I070914]</b></a><br />
Alfred Day lived in Wilbraham, MA until 1813, at which time he went to Boston and enlisted as a drummer, the War of 1812 then being in progress. He was stationed at Commercial Point about 6 miles south of Boston, where a British landing was anticipated. He returned to his native town where he married Lydia Caulkins in 1815. In 1818, he left MA by ox-team and wagon and went to northern Ohio with his wife and child, where he settled in Lot 13 in Mantua Township of Portage County. In 1850, he sold the farm where the last 9 children had been born and moved to Pittsfield Township, Lorain County, OH. Then in 1860, he made another move, this time to MN. Several of his children also moved to MN and they all settled in Castle Rock Twp., Dakota County.<br>
Alfred Day's life had covered a most remarkable period. He had lived under every President of the United States at the time of his death in 1886. He could remember the funeral of Pres. Washington. During his life the railroads and steamboats were invented; also the telegraph. When he was first enumerated in the U.S. census, the total population was about 5,000,000 and he lived to see it grow to nearly 60,000,000. He saw the country grow from a few states along the Atlantic seaboard to a mighty nation which spanned the continent. Looking back, he could remember the War of 1812, the Mexican War, the War of Rebellion, and many other events for 90 years. Alfred passed away on July 13, 1886. Alfred and Lydia are both buried in Castle Rock Valley Cemetery about 6 miles southeast of Farmington, MN, as are many of their descendants. <br>

-----------------------------------<br>
A luncheon for family and friends will be at the Eagles Club Friday following burial.<br>
Duane was born April 6, 1922, in rural Gibbon. He married Ilene Geisert and, together, they had four children. He enlisted in the U.S. Navy to serve our country during World War II. He became a seaman first class on the USS Washington, a battleship assigned to the Pacific Theater. During those three years, the crew fought in 15 major battles, sank more tonnage than any other battleship and never lost a man to the enemy. Admiral Lee commanded his task force from the bridge where Duane 's signal post was. Even in his last weeks, Duane would tap Morse code to impress his children.<br>
After the war, Duane farmed and worked construction. He was among the first to be hired when Eaton Corp. opened in Kearney because of his welding expertise. He retired from Eaton Corp. after 15 years, proudly having never taken a sick day. He is said to have been capable of keeping any and every machine in the plant in operating condition.<br>
Like so many WWII veterans, because Duane enlisted in the Navy, he was unable to complete high school. However, it was the proudest day of his life when, in December 2000, his military service was recognized by Operation Recognition. Operation Recognition made him an honorary graduate by awarding him his high school diploma from Kearney High School.<br>
After retirement, Duane pursued his hobby of restoring antique and classic cars full time. He enjoyed traveling nationally and internationally. He especially looked forward to attending his USS Washington Navy reunions biannually. He was a member of a local car club, the Elks, Eagles, Legion, Moose and VFW service organizations.<br>
Duane is survived by his children, Delbert of Denver, Gary and his wife, Tamara, of Omaha, Carolyn Fenstermacher of Kearney and Cindy Close and her husband, Jeffrey, of Palm Springs, Calif.; grandson, Scott Fenstermacher and his wife, Lori, and two great-granddaughters, Jaina and Shelby Fenstermacher of Springfield, Ill.; sisters, Corinne Olmsted and her husband, Robert, of Kearney and Janice Gentry and her husband, Boyd, of North Platte; and one brother, Dennis and his wife, Sandy, of Gibbon.<br>
He was preceded in death by his parents, Dewey and Laura (Kirk) Day ; sisters, Zelda Burvanis, Osa Kelsey and (Ida) Jane Luther; and one brother, Forrest.<br>
Memorials are suggested to Disabled American Veterans (www.DAV.org).<br>

Thierry d'Alsace (c. 1099 - January 1168), sometimes known as Derry or Dirk, was count of Flanders from 1128 to 1168. He was the youngest son of Duke Thierry II of Lorraine and Gertrude of Flanders.<br>
<br>
After the murder of Charles the Good, Thierry was one the claimants for the county. Due to the support of King Louis VI of France, William Clito became count instead. Thierry succeeded after William's death in 1128.<br>
<br>
His first wife, Suanhilde, died in 1133, leaving an only daughter, Laurette. Laurette of Flanders married four times: (1) Ivan, Count of Alost; (2) Henry II, Duke of Limburg; (3) Raoul I, Count of Vermandois; and (4) Henry I, Count of Luxembourg. Laurette finally retired to a nunnery, where she died in 1170.<br>
<br>
Thierry secondly married Sibylle of Anjou, the former wife of William Clito. Their children were:<br>
   1. Philip of Flanders (died 1191)<br>
   2. Matthew of Alsace (died 1173), married Countess Marie of Boulogne<br>
   3. Margaret I of Flanders (died 1194), married Baldwin V, Count of Hainaut<br>
   4. Gertrude of Flanders (died 1186), married Humbert III of Savoy<br>
   5. Matilda, abbess of Fontevrault<br>
   6. Pierre, bishop of Cambrai (died 1176)<br>
<br>
He was a noted Crusader, having undertaken four pilgrimages from 1139 to 1164. In 1139 he fought alongside his father-in-law Fulk V of Anjou at the invasion of Gilead. Afterwards he joined the Second Crusade, fighting at the Battle of Attalia in 1148; later that year he joined the assembly of King Baldwin III of Jerusalem at Acre. In 1164 he accompanied King Amalric I of Jerusalem to Antioch and Tripoli.<br>
