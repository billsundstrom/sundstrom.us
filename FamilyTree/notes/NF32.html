-------------------------------------------------------<br>
Double Wedding at Woodville -- Atwood / Killam, Cogswell / Killam -- A wedding of great interest to a wide circle of friends throughout the province was solemnized in Woodville United Church at four o'clock Thursday afternoon, September 12th, when the two eldest daughters of Dr and Mrs H E Killam were married. Miss Margaret Dorothy, a graduate in Household Science, Mount Allison, became the bride of Mr Carl Atwood, B S A, M Sc, Toronto, a son of Mr and Mrs H L Atwood, Clyde River, NS, and Miss Kathleen Eleanor, M A, the bride of Laverne E Cogswell, M D C M, only son of Mr and Mrs E W Cogswell, Berwick. The ceremony was performed by Dr S H Prince, the pastor of the church. The church was most artistically decorated by P A Killam, of Woodville, an uncle of the brides. The chancel was completely banked with asparagus and autumn flowers, cornucopia baskets of flowers were used in wall decorations, and the guest pews were marked with broad white ribbons and gladioli. Miss Margaret was given in marriage by her father and Miss Kathleen by her uncle, F W Killam, Halifax. The brides were very lovely in their gowns of white satin with veils caught in cap style with orange blossoms. They carried arm bouquets of white lilies. Miss Joyce Killam, wearing a pink crepe gown with small toque to match and carrying a bouquet of love in the mist and blue delphinium, attaended her sister Margaret, and Miss Nan Chipman, of Kentville, in blue crepe and toque and carrying Rapture roses and larkspur, attended Miss Kathleen. Mr Atwood was supported by Frank Lacey, of Woodville and Dr Cogswell by his cousin, Gerald Nichols of Aylesford. Miss Jessie Bishop, of Wolfville, played the wedding marches, and during the signing of the register, Mrs T A Clarke, of Woodville sang, "At Dawning". The ushers were Laurie Killam and Stanley Illsley. Following the ceremony a reception was held at the home of the brides' parents to about two hundred guests. The drawing room, where the bridal party received, was decorated with blue delphinium and pale yellow calendula, and the dining room with smilax, lilies of the valley and Butterfly roses, the decoration being done by F W Killam, of Halifax, an uncle of the brides. The dining table was centred with a beautifully decorated wedding cake, and at this table, Mrs F W Killam, of Halifax, and Mrs Millidge Collins, of Aylesford, poured. Mrs Killam wore flowered chiffon with corsage of red roses, and black hat, and Mrs Collins, black lace with corsage of pink roses, and black hat. Mrs Bernice Killam, of Woodville, was in charge of the serving, and assisting were: Mrs Beverley Wade, Mrs Fred Barrett, Misses Bert Ed, Laurabel Bigelow, Clara Meek, Muriel Goldsmith, Nina Levy, Kentville; Minnie Bishop, Greenwich; Leota Killam, Halifax; Muriel and Lorna Clarke, Lakeville; Margaret and LaVaughn Nichols, Muriel Spinney, Aylesford; Lorna Killam, Woodville. The brides' mother wore rosewood lace with corsage of Countess of Vandal roses; Mrs Cogswell, plum crepe and velvet costume with a corsage of Potin roses; Miss Winnifred Killam, a navy silk suit with corsage of pink roses. The brides traveled in navy suits and hats. After a honeymoon spent in a camping and canoe trip in Northern New Brunswick and Quebec, Mrs and Mrs Atwood will reside in Toronto where Mr Atwood is a member of the staff of the Department of Biology, University of Toronto. Dr and Mrs Cogswell are taking a motor trip in the maritime provinces, after which they will reside in Berwick, where Dr Cogswell is a successful practising physician. The brides will be greatly missed in Woodville where they have been active socially and in Young People's work. They were each presented with a chest of silver by the Woodville Y P L. Both have been successful teachers, Miss Margaret having taught the past two years in Woodville, and Miss Kathleen has taught in Kings County Academy, Kentville, the four years since her graduating from Dalhousie and obtaining her M A degree from the University of Toronto. The staff presented her with a Sheffield silver entree dish.<br>
