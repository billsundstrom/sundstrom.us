<p>
<a name ="I039081"><b>[I039081]</b></a><br />
LeMoyne Meyer, passed away quietly at home May 8, 2009 following a lengthy illness. He was born in Ashland, OR, August 7, 1936 to Sibiylla and Otto Meyer. LeMoyne was raised and attended school in Castella and Dunsmuir with his brothers Vernon and Richard and sister Ardis.<br>
LeMoyne moved to Weaverville in 1954 to work for Martin Brothers Logging. He married Dorothy Spratt, his wife of 54 years, in 1955. They have three daughters Eva Archibald (Michael), Morgan Kennedy (Lloyd and Jo Dean Gamblin (David). His six grandchildren are Gene Archibald (Heather), Michelle Canfield (Todd), Tyler Kennedy (Holly), Brady Kennedy, and Sierra and Berkeley Gamblin. He has two great-grandchildren, Clara and Thomas Canfield. He also leaves his sister Ardis Simmons (Ken) and sisters-in-law, Lois Meyer, and Deannie Meyer Farris (Bo), and many nieces and nephews.<br>
LeMoyne was a logging truck driver for over 30 years. In his career he drove over a million miles without a moving violation or accident.<br>
He was an avid deer hunter who filled his tags every year, even bagging a three point white buck in the early 50's. He also taught his youngest daughter to be a dead-eye shot. He was a great fisherman. One of his friends said he could catch fish casting behind a water truck. In the 1960's he was a champion arm wrestler in both Trinity and Calvaras counties. He loved playing cribbage and once forgave his wife a $9,000 cribbage debt.<br>
LeMoyne was a hero to his daughters. They knew he could protect them from anything. He had proved it by killing the rogue bear that was breaking into their home (for the second time) in Camp Curry in 1966.<br>
For a man that was only 5'10", everyone thought of him as large. He was a strong man with a tender core who loved his family.<br>
He will be missed. <br>
A memorial picnic will be held at 2:30 p.m. Saturday, May 23 at 960/990 Oregon Street, Weaverville.<br>
