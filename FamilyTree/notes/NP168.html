 EUPHROSYNE
<p>
<a name ="I015164"><b>[I015164]</b></a><br />
Empress Euphrosyne (died ca. 1210) was the wife of Alexius III Angelus who secured the election of her husband to the throne by wholesale bribery. She virtually took the government into her hands, working through the minister Vatatzes and temporarily restored the waning influence of the monarchy over the nobles. Her reputation for profligate extravagance undercut the dynasty's popularity, however, in spite of her talent for government. In the sack of Constantinople in 1203 by the crusaders she was abandoned by her husband but joined him in exile and died in Epirus.<br>
