Romanus I LECAPENUS
<p>
<a name ="I015237"><b>[I015237]</b></a><br />
Romanus Lecapenus, co-emperor with Constantine. He was the emperor's father-in-law, an able but ruthless Armenian whose whole policy was designed to strengthen his own control and establish that of his family.<br>
<br>
Emperor Romanus was seized and imprisoned (d. 948) by the very sons whose interests he had attempted to serve. Emperor Constantine became officially the sole ruler, but governed with the aid of the great general Bardas Phocas, and under the influence of Empress Helena and her favorite, Basil.<br>
<br>
<br>
From Wikipedia<br>
<br>
Romanus I Lecapenus (Romanos I Lakapenos, 870 - 948), who shared the throne of the Byzantine Empire with Constantine VII and exercised all the real power from 919 to 944, was admiral of the Byzantine fleet on the Danube River when, hearing of the defeat of the army at the Battle of Anchialus (917), he resolved to sail for Constantinople.<br>
<br>
After the marriage of his daughter Helena to Constantine he was first proclaimed basileopator ("father of the emperor") in 919 and soon after, crowned colleague of his son-in-law. His reign was uneventful, except for an attempt to check the accumulation of landed property. It was terminated by his own sons, Stephen and Constantine, who in 944 carried him off to the Prince's Islands and compelled him to become a monk. Instead of taking power for themselves, his sons then recognized Constantine VII as sole emperor. Romanus died in 948.<br>
