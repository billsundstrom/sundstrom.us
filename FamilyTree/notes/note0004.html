Leofric (b. abt May 14, 968 - died August 31, 1057) was the Earl of Mercia, who, in 1043, founded monasterys at Coventry and Much Wenlock. Leofric is best remembered as the husband of Godiva, who is said to have ridden through the streets of Coventry naked, in order to persuade her husband to reduce the burden of taxes placed on their subjects by order of King Hardicanute. In the novel by Charles Kingsley, they were the parents of Hereward the Wake, but this is merely a literary device.<br />

John M. Vernarelli, who served in Korea and Vietnam as a military policeofficer and later had a second career as a chef, died Aug. 14 of lungcancer at Gilchrist Hospice Care.<br />
The Perry Hall resident was 80.<br />
Mr. Vernarelli, one of 14 children of Italian immigrants, was born at home on East Chase Street.<br />
When he was 16, he tried to enlist in the Army, until military authorities learned his age and he was sent home from Fort Meade to Baltimore.<br />
"The next year, on March 27, 1947 - one day after his 17th birthday - he enlisted," said a nephew, Mark Vernarelli, who is a spokesman for the state Department of Public Safety and Correction Services.<br />
Mr. Vernarelli remained in the Army for the next 24 years, which included three tours of wartime duty in Korea and later Vietnam.<br />
As a military police officer, he spent the majority of his career traveling across the nation and overseeing the guarding of American munitions that were being shipped to overseas bases.<br />
His decorations included two Bronze Stars, the Legion of Merit, Korean and Vietnam service medals and the Army and NATO commendation medals.<br />
"My uncle was a fine, morally upright man who loved the Army and serving his country," his nephew said.<br />
"He followed two older brothers into military service and enjoyed every day of it."<br />
While stationed at Fort Devans, Mass., Mr. Vernarelli met and fell in love with the former Jane Illsley, who worked for the provost marshal. They married in 1961.<br />
While in the Army, Mr. Vernarelli earned his General Educational Development certificate and later attended Virginia Community College in Annandale, Va.<br />
After being discharged from the Army in 1971, Mr. Vernarelli and his wife settled in Northern Virginia, where he launched a second career as a chef.<br />
"He liked cooking, and his friend, Tom Weston, who owned Tom Weston's in Annandale, said he needed a chef for a while, so my husband took the job and stayed 10 years," Mrs. Vernarelli said.<br />
He also had cooked at Vinnie's in Fairfax, Va.<br />
"At home," Mrs. Vernarelli said, "he liked cooking seafood, and one of his specialties was Seafood Norfolk."<br />
The couple, who returned to Baltimore in 1987, later settled in Perry Hall.<br />
Mr. Vernarelli, who never lost his love for the Army, enjoyed visiting military bases where his two daughters, who had married career military officers, lived.<br />
He also enjoyed fishing and traveling.<br />
A Mass of Christian burial was offered Wednesday at St. Joseph Roman Catholic Church in Fullerton.<br />
Mr. Vernarelli is also survived by two daughters, Carla Hein of Andrews Air Force Base and Christa Lippert of Fort Benning, Ga.; two sisters, Edith Ireland of Baltimore and Mary Toutloff of Arbutus; and six grandchildren.<br />

Robert was Called "The Magnificent" (French, "le Magnifique") for his love of finery. He was the son of Duke Richard II of Normandy and Judith, daughter of Conan I, Duke of Brittany.<br />
When his father died, his elder brother Richard succeeded, whilst he became Count of Hiémois. When Richard died a year later, there were great suspicions that Robert had Richard murdered, hence his other nickname, "Robert le diable" (the devil). He is often mis-identified with the legendary Robert the Devil.<br />
Robert aided King Henry I of France against Henry's rebellious brother and mother, and for his help he was given the territory of the Vexin. He also intervened in the affairs of Flanders, supported Edward the Confessor, who was then in exile at Robert's court, and sponsored monastic reform in Normandy.<br />
By his mistress, Herleva, he was father of the future William the Conqueror. An illegitimate daughter, Adelaide, became Countess of Ponthieu and Countess of Champagne.<br />
After making his illegitimate son William his heir, he made a pilgrimage to Jerusalem and died at Nicaea between 1-3 of July, 1035. His son William, aged about eight, succeeded him.<br />

THE DANCE: JOHANNA BOYCE<br />
 <br />
By JENNIFER DUNNING<br />
New York Time, 3 May 1984<br />
 <br />
Laws of chance and behavior predicated on them are the subject of ''Facing the Odds,'' a richly textured, funny and poignant performance piece by Johanna Boyce, a leading young post- modernist, that was presented at the Kitchen on Tuesday. Here, for once, was the kind of seamless weave of elements - dance, drama, visual effects and personal history - that performance art is said to be meant to be, and a considered articulation of a whole.<br />
 <br />
The piece opens with a formal processional of its five performers, all women and all dressed in nicely tatty evening wear. They walk about a darkened stage as a voice intones fortunes, some of the familiar general kind and some of a quirky specificity very much of this time. In an eerily ritualistic passage, two of the women are helped out of their dresses and are left alone onstage in camisole- style underwear. They engage in a tussling, sensuous duet through which they talk with each other about their fathers and sisters. The offstage voice suggests another question as the dance winds down. ''Annuel, are you close to your sister?'' Cydney Wilkes asks. ''Yeah, I would say so,'' Annuel Dowdell says thoughtfully, and they walk off together arm in arm.<br />
 <br />
There follows a very funny sequence in which the voice guides the amusingly forthright Diana McWilliams through a solo that is half card tricks and half storytelling, then nudges Damelia Mujica and Robbyn Scott through a chance-predicting game with toy horses.<br />
 <br />
One witty dance passage has its four performers engaged in close- woven, stream-of-consciousness charades. Another is a trio with a curious lack of artifice, as if the performers were engaged in some athletic game for three. Dressed in exotic ragtags designed, imaginatively, by Joan Adele Sweet, the women end the piece in a stately, mysterious formal dance that is much helped by its deceptively simple score by Richard Munson, in which repeated, gently percussive piano tones build to an intricate melodic fabric of sound.<br />
 <br />
It is very like Miss Boyce's piece as a whole, on which the performers collaborated. And by the end of the evening, one has a vivid and touching sense of each of the women's personalities. We make the mistake, that backstage voice declares at one point, of thinking that the future depends on the arbitrary past. But the two dissimilar daughter-sisters connect, as do all the women in ''Facing the Odds,'' and make their own history for a few moments.<br />
 <br />
The magic effects woven into this purposeful theater-dance piece were created by Michael Canick, and Pat Dignan designed the atmospheric lighting. The program also included ''Bombshells,'' which juxtaposed images of popular dancing with exploding buildings, all filmed from television by Miss Boyce and John Schabel. Like the pair's previous ''Waterbodies,'' the film was a poorly crafted, safely obscure blur.<br />

Dr. George Mitchell Furnival, BSc (University of Manitoba, 1929), MA(Queenʼs University, 1933), PhD (Massachusetts Institute of Technology,1935) died on 29 July 2010 in Calgary Alberta at the age of 102. He wasborn in Winnipeg, Manitoba on 25 July 1908 to parents William George andGrace Una (Rothwell).<br />
For 9 years (1927-36) he was employed by the Government Department of Mines and by mining companies as a Field Geologist. He advanced to the position of Assistant Mine Superintendent for OʼBrien Mining (1936-39). During this period, he and his wife Marion lived in a log cabin near the mine close to Hawk Junction, Ontario. His first son was born in a Red Cross outpost and subsequently, mother and son were transported by dogsled back to the cabin. Following this period, he worked for the Geological Survey of Canada (1939-42) and published numerous technical papers and government reports on mining and petroleum fields including the Geological Survey of Canada Memoir 242 Cyprus Lake Map-Area, Saskatchewan, becoming a standard university reference text.<br />
For 28 years (1942-70) he served Standard Oil of California (Chevron). However, during 1946- 48, he was appointed Manitobaʼs Director of Mines and was granted leave of absence from Chevron. During this time he promulgated Manitobaʼs first comprehensive petroleum legislation for the exploration, production and conservation of oil and gas in Manitoba. He also developed a new geological concept for S.W. Manitoba based upon his knowledge of the geology found in the California Kemp No. 1 well, drilled in W. North Dakota in 1938. Chevron acquired permits, did seismic surveys and drilled its first well in 1950, which discovered the Daly Oilfield, the first commercial oil in Manitoba. Also in 1946 while Director of Mines of Manitoba, he founded the Manitoba Geological Survey, employing a staff of 6 geologists, for the first time on a permanent basis, to serve the mining, petroleum and industrial minerals industries of Manitoba. In 1947 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Canada.<br />
Following this leave of absence, he returned to Calgary to continue working for Standard Oil of California (Chevron). He worked with teams under his direction making significant petroleum discoveries in Alberta, Manitoba, Trinidad, and Columbia, while holding various positions including: from 1950-55 Vice President and Director of California Standard Alberta, and from 1952-60 President and Director of Dominion Oil Trinidad. In 1953 he conceived a new principle, ʻProgressive Displacementʼ, to explain the accumulation of oil and gas fields in sequential traps on the undip margins of basins, that occur in reverse order of their specific gravities.<br />
In 1955 he moved his residence to San Francisco, to take up the positions of Director and Vice President Exploration, Chevron Overseas Petroleum (San Francisco) from 1955-63, and Assistant, Land, to Vice President Exploration and Land, Standard Oil of California San Francisco from 1958-63. In 1963 he again moved his residence to take up his new position as Chairman and Managing Director of Western Australian Petroleum (WAPET Pty. Ltd.) in Perth W.A. for the period 1963-70. At the same time, inclusively, from 1953-70 (as Vice-President Exploration, and Director of various subsidiaries), he directed numerous offshore seismic and drilling programs in Trinidad, Bahamas, Guatemala, British Guyana, Cuba, Belize, Ecuador, Peru, and Australia. In 1965 WAPET announced the first commercial oilfield in Western Australia, located on Barrow Island 64 kilometers off Australiaʼs northwestern coast. Although Barrow Island consists of 214 desolate square kilometers in area, in 1908 it had been declared an A-Class reserve by the West Australian Government; a wildlife sanctuary status that only an Act of Parliament could disturb. Dr. Furnival was instrumental in preserving this wildlife sanctuary status during the exploration and full operation of the oilfields as described by W.H. Butler, one of Australiaʼs best-known naturalists, in an article The Lesson of Barrow Island published in the Australian Readerʼs Digest, August 1973 in which he describes "In an unusual conservation experiment, an oil company shows that industry and the natural environment can exist in harmony".<br />
 In 1971 Dr. Furnival returned to Calgary where he established a Consulting practice from 1971- 72. He then took up the positions of Vice President Operations Director for Brascan Resources in 1973, member of the Executive Committee as Senior Vice President in 1975, and also President and Director Coalition Mining, Senior Consultant in 1977. From 1978-80 while holding the position of President, CEO and Director, Western Mines, he developed a geological concept and initiated a program that led to the discovery of a major base metal/precious metal ore body at its Vancouver Island, Myra Falls Mine. He went on to become Executive Vice President, General Manager and Director, Westmin Resources from 1981-82, President and Director, Western Coal Holdings, and President, CO & Director, Lathwell Resources from 1983-85. In the following years (1985 - 2001) he continued as a Petroleum and Mining Consultant.<br />

Known as the most beautiful woman in Wales. She had many lovers. InChristmas 1108 Owain ap Cadwgan of Cardigan came to visit Gerald andNesta. He so lusted after her that he, that night, attacked the castleand carried her off and had his way with her. This upset Henry I [King ofEngland] so much that the incident started a war.<br />
Source:www.dcs.hull.ac.ukShe was stunningly beautiful, called the Helen of Wales. She was thedaughter of the last king of indenpendent Deheubarth, she was themistress of Henry I, king of England,and had a son by him Robert DeCarn, Earl of Dorchester and Gloucester. Henry I took the throne awayfrom his brother in 1100. She was the wife of Gerald de Windsor,Constable of Pembroke, she was romantically abducted by Owain apCadwgan,son of the Prince of Powys, and is generally supposed to have had anynumber of other romantic liaisons. She was the founder of moredynastiesthan is polite to mention. Thousands of Welsh children today arestill<br />
refered to as Nest in her honour.<br />
 <br />
From Wikipedia<br />
 <br />
Nest verch Rhys (died after 1136) was a princess of Deheubarth who was renowned for her beauty. She was the daughter of Prince Rhys ap Tewdwr by his wife, Gwladys verch Rhiwallon.<br />
 <br />
After her father died in 1093, Deheubarth was conquerored by the Normans and King Henry I of England appointed himself her protector. Nest bore him a son, Henry FitzRoy. In 1100 King Henry decided to marry her to one of his knights, Gerald of Windsor, whom he appointed castellan of Pembroke. Nest and Gerald had four children:<br />
   1. William FitzGerald (died 1173)<br />
   2. Maurice FitzGerald, Lord of Lanstephen (died September 1, 1177)<br />
   3. David FitzGerald, Archdeacon of Cardigan and Bishop of St. David's<br />
   4. Angharad de Windsor<br />
 <br />
During Christmas 1109, Nest and her husband were visited by her cousin, Owain ap Cadwgan. Owain was so taken with Nest's beauty that he and fifteen companions attacked Cenarth Bychan, seized Nest, and carried her off. This abduction earned her the nickname "Helen of Wales" because it led to civil war on a small scale. Nest bore to Owain two sons, Llywelyn and Einion, before finally being returned to her husband. After Gerald's death, Nest became the lover of Stephen, constable of Cardigan, by whom she had another son, Robert FitzStephen.<br />
 <br />
Nest's daughter, Angharad, was the mother of historian Gerald of Wales. Her sons Maurice and Robert campaigned in Ireland with Strongbow; Robert died there in 1182.<br />

Gruffydd ap Cynan (c. 1055-1137) was a Prince of Gwynedd.<br />
 <br />
Much of the information about Gruffydd's life comes from a tract of disputed authority: The Life of Gruffydd ap Cynan. According to this text, Gruffydd was born near Swords, County Dublin in Ireland. He was the son of a Welsh Prince, Cynan ap Iago, who was a claimant to the Kingship of Gwynedd but was probably never king of Gwynedd. His mother was a member of the Hiberno-Norse dynasty that ruled Dublin. Through his mother, Grruffydd claimed relationships with many of the leading spets in Ireland, including those of the Ua Briain.<br />
 <br />
During his many struggles to gain the kingship of Gwyneed, Gruffydd received considerable aid from Ireland, both from the Hiberno-Norse at Dublin, but also those at Wexford, and also from Muirchertach Ua Briain.<br />
 <br />
During his lengthy reign, considered to be a "Golden Age" for Wales, he retook much of Gwynedd from its English conquerors. He was succeeded by his son Owain Gwynedd.<br />

William de Braose, Lord of Abergavenny (c. 1197 - May 2, 1230) was the son of Reginald de Braose by his first wife, Gracia de Briwere. The Welsh, who detested him, called him Gwilym Ddu (Black William). He succeeded his father in his various lordships in 1227, including Abergavenny and Builth.<br />
 <br />
He was married to Eva Marshall, daughter of the famous William Marshall. They had four daughters and coheiresses:<br />
   1. Isabella, wife of Prince Dafydd ap Llywelyn<br />
   2. Maud, wife of Roger Mortimer, 1st Baron Wigmore<br />
   3. Eleanor, wife of Humphrey de Bohun<br />
   4. Eve, wife of William de Cantelou<br />
 <br />
He was captured and imprisoned (as an act of retaliation) by Llywelyn the Great, ruler of most of Wales, in 1229, but was given relative freedom because he was related to the prince by marriage in several ways; his daughter, Isabella, was married to Llywelyn's only legitimate son. However, William then began an affair with Llywelyn's wife, the Princess Joan. The Chronicle of Ystrad Fflur entry for 1230 reads:<br />
    "In this year William de Breos the Younger, lord of Brycheiniog, was hanged by the Lord Llywelyn in Gwynedd, after he had been caught in Llywelyn's chamber with the king of England's daughter, Llywelyn's wife."<br />
 <br />
Llywelyn had William hanged on May 2, 1230. Joan herself was later pardoned.<br />

From Wikipedia<br />
 <br />
Reginald de Braose (died 1227) was the son of William de Braose, 4th Lord of Bramber and Matilda de St. Valery. He was a scion of the powerful Marcher family of Braose, and related by marriage to the Princes of Wales.<br />
 <br />
He supported his brother Giles in his rebellions against King John. They were both active against the King in the baron's war. Neither was present at the signing of Magna Carta because they were still rebels who refused to compromise. John acquiesced to Reginald's claims to the de Braose estates in Wales in May 1216. He became Lord of Brecon, Abergavenny, Builth and other Marcher Lordships but was very much a vassal of Llewelyn Fawr, Prince of Gwynedd who became his father-in-law in 1222 when Reginald married Llywelyn's daughter, Gwladys Ddu. Henry III restored Reginald to favour and the Bramber estates (confiscated from William by King John) in 1217. At this seeming betrayal, Rhys and Owain, Reginald's nephews who were princes of Deheubarth, were incensed and they took Builth (except the castle). Llywelyn Fawr also became angry and besieged Brecon. Reginald eventually surrendered to Llewelyn and gave up Seinhenydd (Swansea). By 1221 they were at war again with Llewelyn laying siege to Builth. The siege was relieved by Henry III's forces. From this time on Llewelyn tended to support the claims of Reginald's nephew John de Braose concerning the de Braose lands.<br />
 <br />
Reginald was a witness to the re-issue of Magna Carta by Henry III in 1225. He died two years later and was succeeded by his son, the ill-fated William de Braose, Lord of Abergavenny. His daughter Matilda was the wife of Rhys Mechyll, Prince of Deheubarth.<br />

Death was 1617 - didn't match burial date.<br />
MARRIAGE: Listed as "unknown" by most sources, the ancestral file gave John's wife the name of Alice Smith.<br />
BIRTH: Ancestral file birthdate of 1575 was 3 years before the birth of her son, John, 5 years before Thomas was born, etc. Children were also born 17-36 years before Alice's marriage to Thomas. Therefore, abt. birthdate changed from 1773 to 1560, and MARRIAGE date changed to allow for children's births. It is possible the file dates were correct, and Alice Smith is not the correct mother of these children.<br />

Roger de Beaumont; Seigneur (feudal Lord) of Beaumont,Pontaudemer,Brionne and Vatteville, Normandy; married Adeline, sister ofHugh Countof Meulan and daughter by his 1st wife of Waleran CountofMeulan.[Burke's Peerage]<br />
 <br />
---------------------------------------<br />
 <br />
The well-known Roger de Beaumont held Sturminster Marshal, Dorset, in1086; it descended to the counts of Meulan through Roger's eldest son,Robert count of Meulan. That Roger took his name from Beaumont is a partofthe general history of Normandy. It follows that Roger's descendants,the counts of Meulan, the Earls of Leicester, and the Earls of Warwick,all derive from Beaumont-le-Roger. [The Origins of Some Anglo-NormanFamilies]<br />
 <br />
Roger was one of the most powerful noblemen of his era. He furnishedsixty warships for William the Conqueror's invasion fleet, but remainedbehind to govern Normandy in William's absence. In later life, he becamea monk.<br />

We have a discrepancy on the birth date. On Tree # 273 it shows 1598. Thesource stating 1585 is Church of Later Day Saints AFN:8P1S-L7. It is myopinion that his birth date is 1585, which supports the comment of hisbeing excused from service because of age. He would have been 47 when hearrived here. This makes him 37 at time of marriage and 16 years olderthan Abigail, which is not uncommon.<br />
    I don't feel this gives him time to have a son John b1598, but it is possible he could have had a previous marriage.<br />
 <br />
    John Benjamin and family are identified on passenger list of the LYON as well as his brother Richard.<br />
 <br />
    For those of you who have access to ancestry.com..I highly recommend you read the excerpt for "Great Migration Begins: Immigrants to New England 1620-35" This article is tremendous, it addresses all the events in his life since his arrival and those of his children. It is also referenced in a book "Benjamins in America". I haven't seen that book as of yet. There is far too much information for me to relate on this family page.<br />
 <br />
    In "The Complete Book of Immigrants" 1607-1660, it lists the names of men transported from London to New England to the plantations, and per certificate from Captain Mason on 6/22/1632 (date of embarkation) "have taken the oath of allegiance". Among those listed are John Benjamin and Richard Benjamin (note the spelling is Benjamin not Benjamin) (PRO E157/16).<br />
 <br />
    It is thought that his great friendship with John Winthrop was the reason he came to America. Also 2 of Abigail's brothers were here.<br />

Robert de Beaumont, 2nd Earl of Leicester (1104-5 April 1168), also knownas Robert "Le Bossu" (meaning "Robert the Uneven" in French), was anEnglish nobleman of French ancestry. He was the son of Robert deBeaumont, 1st Earl of Leicester and the twin brother of Waleran deBeaumont.<br />
 <br />
The two brothers, Robert and Waleran, were adopted into the royal household shortly after their father's death (upon which instance Robert inherited all of his father's hereditary titles, chiefly Earl of Leicester). They accompanied King Henry I among various missions, firstly to Normandy, then to meet with Pope Callixtus II in 1119. In 1135, the two twins were present at King Henry's deathbed; the monarch's death led to The Anarchy (under the weak rule of King Stephen), and Robert eventually captured his rival, Roger de Tosny. In June of 1139, the inseparable brothers led the actions against Roger of Salisbury (the Bishop of Salisbury) and Alexander (the Bishop of Lincoln); the former was killed in December of that year, while the latter survived for eight more years.<br />
 <br />
King Stephen had taken the two brothers as his personal advisors; the two brothers remained in his confidence for several decades. However, after Stephen's compromise with his wife, Matilda (wherein Henry, Matilda's son from a previous marriage, would succeed Stephen as king), the twins provided Henry, soon to be crowned Henry II of England, with "means for his struggle." Thereafter, the brothers were in the new monarch's confidence, as evidenced by Robert's appointment as chief justiciar and as a hereditary steward; eventually, he bought out Hugh Bigod, 1st Earl of Norfolk (another noble who enjoyed the confidence of the crown) and is considered the first Lord High Steward of England. Robert enjoyed a high status in Henry's court, even acting as head of the kingdom (in a vice-regal capacity) for a time. His name appeared at the top of the Constitutions of Clarendon, and he was present at the Council of Northampton.<br />
 <br />

 <br />
He was affianced, at the age of 4 years, to Aubrey DE CAUMVILLE (who was about the same age), but he did not marry her (b2). He married, 1stly,Maud [c2], widow of Sir William LUNGESPEE, of Amesbury, Aldbourne, and Trowbridge, Wilts, Canford, Dorset, Bicester, Oxon; Brattleby, co.,Lincoln, &c. (who died between 23 December 1256 and 3 January 1256/7], and daughter and heir of Sir Walter DE CLIFFORD, of Clifford co.Hereford, Cortham, Salop, &c., by Margaret, daughter of Llewelyn abI ORWERTH, PRINCE OF NORTH WALES.

She died shortly before 13 December 1338. [Complete Peerage V:639-44, (transcribedby Dave Utzinger)]<br />
 <br />
(c1) In 1221 this Elis stated that "Osbertus Giffard, antecessor suus quivenit ad conquestum Angl' tenuit manerium de Bimesfeld' . . . et post eumElias flius suus . . . et post eum Elias filius illius Elie et patersuus." At least one generation is here omitted. The Elis living in 1221 was son and heir of Elis III, by Maud, daughter of Morice fitz Robertfitz Hardinge, of Berkeley: which Elis III owed 100 marks 'pro fine terresue' in 1166 and died before Michaelmas 1190, when William le Mareschalowed 140 marks for the custody of the lands of Elis Giffard. Elis III wasson and heir of Elis II (who became a monk in Gloucester Abbey), by Berta(living 1167), sister of Walter de Clifford, of Clifford and Glasbury,and daughter of Richard fitz Ponce. In 1130 Elis II rendered account of100 marks of silver for the relief of his father's lands, being son and heir of Elis I, by Ala, his wife. Before 1096 Elis I had succeeded his father Osbern Giffard, the Domesday tenant of Brimpsfield, Stoke, Rockhampton, Elston, Orcheston, etc.<br />
 <br />
(a) John Mautravers gave the manor of Ashton and the advows on of thechurch of Saint Peter at Codford, Wilts, to Elis Giffard in free marriage with Alice his sister, to hold to them and their heirs of their bodies, by the service of a knight's fee.<br />
 <br />
(b1) "Elias Giffard". He held the manor of Winterburne (now Elston), ofthe King in chief, as the head of his barony; the manor of Sherringtonpertaining to that barony; and that of Ashton, held of John Mautravers in free marriage. Heir [name cut away] his son aged 16 [rest cut away]. Theproof of age of this heir, John Giffard, is undated and defective, but it states that he was born on the day of St. Wulstan (19 Jan).<br />
 <br />
(b2) So the proof of age mentioned above. She was probably the Aubrey deCanville, a nun of Polesworth, who was elected Abbess in Dec 1276 or inthe following month. The marriage was contracted at Arrow, co. Warwick,and she must have been a daughter of Thomas de Camville, of Arrow, and a descendant of Aubrey Marmion, Lady of Arrow, wife of William deCaumville.<br />
 <br />
[c2] Maud Lungespee notified the King that John Giffard had abducted her from her manor of Canford, Dorset, and taken her against her will to his castle of Brimpsfield, and there detained her. John appeared before the King, and professed himself ready to prove that he did not abduct her against her will, and offered a fine of 300 marks for the marriage already contracted, as it was said, between them, provided she made no further complaint against him. On 10 March 1270/1 the King ordained thatif she were not content, the said fine should be void, and John should stand his trial at a month from Easter. And as she was too unwell toappear before the King, commissioners were sent to inquire into the truth of the matter, and to certify the King thereof. John and Maud, and her Ist husband, William Lungespee, were all descended from Richard fitzPonce. Why John Giffard should have referred to himself as being of therace of Le Lungespee as in the proof of age mentioned above he is said to have done-is not explicable; unless, indeed, the so briquet was derived from the family of Clifford.<br />

Hugh of Vermandois (1053 - October 18, 1101), was son to King Henry I of France and Anne of Kiev, and the younger brother of King Philip I of France. He was in his own right Count of Vermandois. He married Adela of Vermandois, the daughter of Heribert IV, Count of Valois and Adela de Vexin. William of Tyre called him "Hugh Magnus", Hugh the Great, but he was an ineffectual leader and soldier, great only in his boasting.<br />
 <br />
In early 1096 Hugh and Philip began discussing the First Crusade after news of the Council of Clermont reached them in Paris. Although Philip could not participate, as he had been excommunicated, Hugh was said to have been influenced to join the Crusade after an eclipse of the moon on February 11, 1096.<br />
 <br />
That summer Hugh's army left France for Italy, where they would cross the Adriatic Sea into territory of the Byzantine Empire, unlike the other Crusader armies who were travelling by land. On the way, many of the soldiers led by fellow Crusader Emich of Leiningen joined Hugh's army after Emich was defeated by the Hungarians, whose land he had been pillaging. Hugh crossed the Adriatic from Bari in southern Italy, but many of his ships were destroyed in a storm off the Byzantine port of Dyrrhachium. Hugh and most of his army was rescued and escorted to Constantinople, where they arrived in November of 1096. Prior to his arrival, Hugh sent an arrogant, insulting letter to Emperor Alexius I, demanding that Alexius meet with him: "Know, O King, that I am King of Kings, and superior to all, who are under the sky. You are now permitted to greet me, on my arrival, and to receive me with magnificence, as befits my nobility." Alexius was already wary of the armies about to arrive, after the unruly mob led by Peter the Hermit had passed through earlier in the year. Alexius kept Hugh in custody in a monastery until Hugh swore an oath of vassalage to him.<br />
 <br />
After the Crusaders had successfully made their way across Seljuk territory and, in 1098, captured Antioch, Hugh was sent back to Constantinople to appeal for reinforcements from Alexius. Alexius was uninterested, however, and Hugh, instead of returning to Antioch to help plan the siege of Jerusalem, went back to France. There he was scorned for not having fulfilled his vow as a Crusader to complete a pilgrimage to Jerusalem, and Pope Paschal II threatened to excommunicate him. He joined the minor Crusade of 1101, but was wounded in battle with the Turks at Heraclea in June, and died of his wounds in October in Tarsus.<br />
 <br />
By his wife, Adele of Vermandois, Hugh had seven children:<br />
   1. Count Raoul I of Vermandois<br />
   2. Simon, Bishop of Noyon<br />
   3. Isabella de Vermandois, married (1) Robert de Beaumont, 1st Earl of Leicester; (2) William de Warenne, 2nd Earl of Surrey<br />
   4. Matilde de Vermandois, married Raoul I of Beaugency<br />
   5. Constance de Vermandois, married Godefroy de la Ferte-Gaucher<br />
   6. Agnes de Vermandois, married Bonifacio, Marchese del Vasto<br />
   7. Beatrix de Vermandois, married Hugh III of Gournay-en-Bray<br />

Henry I (French: Henri Ier) (May 4, 1008-August 4, 1060) was King ofFrance from 1031 to 1060.<br />
 <br />
A member of the Capetian Dynasty, Henri was born in Reims, France, the son of King Robert II (972-1031) and Constance d'Arles (973-1032). He was crowned King of France at the Cathedral in Reims on May 14, 1027.<br />
 <br />
The reign of Henri I, like those of his predecessors, was marked by territorial struggles, including joining his brother Robert in a revolt against his father. In a strategic move, Henri came to the rescue of his very young nephew-in-law, the newly appointed Duke William of Normandy, (who would go on to become William the Conqueror), to suppress a revolt by William's vassals. In 1047 Henri secured the dukedom for William in their decisive victory over the vassals at a battle near Caen.<br />
 <br />
A few years later, when William, who was cousin to king Edward the Confessor of England, married the daughter of the count of Flanders, King Henri I feared William's potential power. In 1054 and again in 1058 Henri went to war to try to conquer Normandy from William, but on both occasions he was defeated. Despite his efforts, Henri's thirty-year reign saw feudal power in France reach its pinnacle.<br />
 <br />
King Henri I died on August 4, 1060 in Vitry-en-Brie, France, and was interred in Saint Denis Basilica. He was succeeded by his son, Philippe I, who was 7 at the time of his death; for six years Henri's queen, Anne of Kiev, ruled as regent.<br />
 <br />
He was also duke of Burgundy from 1016 to 1032, when he abdicated the duchy to his brother Robert Capet.<br />
 <br />
Marriages:<br />

Constance of Arles (973 - July 25, 1034) was the third wife and queen of King Robert II of France. She was the daughter of Count Guilhem II of Provence and Adelais of Anjou, and the sister of Count Guilhem III of Provence.<br />
 <br />
In 1003 she was married to King Robert, after his divorce from his second wife. The marriage was stormy; the family of Robert's second queen, Bertha, opposed her, and Constance was despised for importing her Provençal kinfolk. Robert's friend, Hugh of Beauvais, tried to convince the king to repudiate her in 1007. Constance's response was to have Beauvais murdered by the knights of her kinsman, Fulk Nerra. In 1010 Robert even went to Rome, accompanied by his former wife Bertha, to seek permission to divorce Constance and remarry Bertha. Constance encouraged her sons to revolt against their father, and then favored her younger son, Robert, over her elder son, Henri.<br />

 <br />
    "At the king's command, Queen Constance stood before the doors of the Church, to prevent the common people from killing them inside the Church, and they were expelled from the bosom of the Church. As they were being driven out, the queen struck out the eye of Stephen, who had once been her confessor, with the staff which she carried in her hand."<br />
 <br />
The symbolism, or reality, of putting an eye out is used often in medieval accounts to show the ultimate sin of breaking of one's oath, whether it be heresy, or treason to ones lordship, or in this case both. Stephen's eye was put out by the hand of a Queen wielding a staff (royal scepters were usually tipped with a cross) thus symbolically providing justice for the treasoned lord on earth and in heaven.<br />
 <br />
Constance and Robert had seven children:<br />
   1. Advisa, Countess of Auxerre, (c.1003-after 1063), married Count Renaud I of Nevers<br />
   2. Hugh Magnus, co-king (1007-September 17, 1025)<br />
   3. Henri (May 4, 1008-August 4, 1060)<br />
   4. Adela, Countess of Contenance (1009-June 5, 1063), married (1) Duke Richard III of Normandy (2) Count Baldwin V of Flanders<br />
   5. Robert I, Duke of Burgundy (1011-March 21, 1076)<br />
   6. Eudes (1013-1056)<br />
   7. Constance (1014-unknown), married Manasses de Dammartin<br />
 <br />
At Constance's urging, her eldest son Hugh Magnus was crowned co-king alongside his father in 1017. Hugh Magnus demanded his parents share power with him, and rebelled against his father in 1025. He died suddenly later that year, an exile and a fugitive. Robert and Constance quarelled over which of their surviving sons should inherit the throne; Robert favored their second son Henri, while Constance favored their third son, Robert. Despite his mother's protests, Henry was crowned in 1027. Fulbert, Bishop of Chartres, wrote a letter claiming that he was "frightened away" from the consecration of Henry "by the savagery of his mother, who is quite trustworthy when she promises evil."<br />
 <br />
Constance encouraged her sons to rebel, and Henri and Robert began attacking and pillaging the towns and castles belonging to their father. Robert attacked Burgundy, the duchy he had been promised but had never received, and Henry seized Dreux. At last King Robert agreed to their demands and peace was made which lasted until the king's death.<br />
 <br />
King Robert died in 1031, and soon Constance was at odds with both her elder son, Henri, and her younger son Robert. Constance seized her dower lands and refused to surrender them. Henri fled to Normandy, where he received aid, weapons, and soldiers from his brother Robert. He returned to besiege his mother at Poissy, but Constance escaped to Pontoise. She only surrendered when Henri began the siege of Puiset and swore to slaughter all the inhabitants.<br />
 <br />
Constance died in 1034, and was buried beside her husband Robert at Saint-Denis Basilica.<br />

Matthew Paris wrote, 'Foul as it is, hell itself is defiled by thepresence of King John', and this pretty well sums up John'sreputation--until 1944, that is. For in that year Professor Galbraithdemonstrated in a lecture to an astonished world that the chief chroniclesource for the reign of John was utterly unreliable. Since then bad KingJohn has been getting better and better, until now he is nearly wellagain, and a leading scholar in the field has seriously warned us thatthe twentieth century could well create it own John myth.<br />
 <br />
A man who can create so many myths, or rather have them created about him, is clearly outstanding in some way, but the myths hide the truth. Plainly the chroniclers who invented stories about him after his death can tell us little, and we should not take too much notice of people who condemned John for carrying out his father's (and his brother's officials'] policies and administratrive routines, nor indeed those who condemned him because of the bitter troubles that happened in the succeeding reign, troubles which were in no means entirely of John's making. Recent historians have turned to the administrative records of his reign, and found there a very different picture; but still the lingering doubts remain--were these records the result of John's skill and application or of those of his able staff?<br />
 <br />
John was a paunchy little man, five feet five inches tall, with erect head, staring eyes, flaring nostrils and thick lips set in a cruel pout, as his splendid monument at Worcester shows. He had the tempestous nature of all his family, and a driving demoniac energy: Professor Barlow says that 'he prowled around his kingdom,' which is an evocative phrase, but it would be truer to say that he raced around it. He was fastidious about his person--taking more baths than several other medieval kings put together, and owning the ultimate in luxury, for that time, a dressing-gown. He loved good food and drink, and gambled a great deal, though he usually lost--the results of his typical impatience and carelessness are recorded on his expense rolls; above all things he loved women. Some say his 'elopment' was the cause of his loss of Normandy. He was generous to the poor (for instance, he remitted to them the penalties of the forest law), and to his servants; at the least he went through the motions of being a Christian king. He was extortionate, though if one considers the terrific increase in his outgoings (a mercenary soldier cost him 200 per cent more in wages than he would have in Henry II's day) one can understand some of his actions in the field. He was deeply concerned about justice, took care to attend to court business, and listened to supplicants with sympathy; he had also an urgent desire for peace in the land, saying that his peace was to be observed 'even if we have granted it to a dog.' But for all that, he had two totally unredeeming vices; he was suspicious, and enjoyed a cloak-and-dagger atmosphere--simply he did not inspire trust in his subjects. Dr. Warren says of him with some justice that if he had lived in the twentieth centure he would have adored to run a secret police.<br />
 <br />
He was born at Oxford on Christmas Eve 1167. He was oblated for a monk at the abbey of Fontevrault at the age of one year, but was back at court by the time he was six--plainly he had no vocation, but he probably picked up at this early stage his fastidiousness and his passion for books: his library followed him wherever he went. He was his father's favourite, but he turned against the old man when his chance came, as he did against Richard (who had been very generous to his brother) when the latter was in captivity in 1193. The episode was a miserable failure, but it possibly sowed the seeds of distrust for John in England, where they began to sprout luxuriantly in 1199 when Richard died and John came to the throne.<br />
 <br />
Immeditaely the challenge came: Philip Augustus, the wily King of France, was backing John's nephew, Prince Arthur of Brittany (son of John's elder brother Geoffrey) as a contender for the throne, and England's French possessions fell prey to civil war. John found grave difficultly in dealing with the situation for a number of reasons, but in 1202 he made the remarkable coup of capturing Arthur by force-marching his troups eighty miles in forty-eight hours; but then his prosecution of the war became listless, and he lost much sympathy by his brutal murder of Arthur whilst in a drunken rage. By 1204 Normandy was lost.<br />
 <br />
The loss of Normandy seemed to wake John up, and he now deployed his every energy in building up the coastal defences of Britain, now faced with an enemy the other side of the Channel, instead of just more of her own territory. The navy was built up, and the army, and John poured a quarter of his annual revenue into defence. But he could not persuade the baronage to support him in a counterstroke to regain Normandy: the barons of the north country had never owned land in Normandy and did not see why they should pay to regain southerners's castles for them. These 'Northerners' as they called themselves, were a hive of discontent, and more was to be heard from them. Meanwhile, John sailed angrily about in the Channel, cursing ineffectually.<br />
 <br />
Other troubles were to come first, however. In 1205 the Archbishop of Canterbury, Hubert Walker, died, and John assumed that he would have the choice of the new archbishop. However, Pope Innocent III was no man to support secular control over church appointments, and supported the right of the monks of Canterbury to select their own archbishop. For two years the storms blew betwen England and Rome, then Stephen Langton was appointed. Meanwhile John had driven the monks into exile and appropriated the revenues of the archdiocese. He had fallen out also with his half-brother, Geoffrey Archbishop or York, over tax-collection, and he too fled abroad while John collected his revenues. Four bishops joined in his fight--tension was growing to the snapping point. In 1208 the Pope put an Interdict on England, which in effect meant the clergy went on stike, or, in certain cases and areas, worked to rule. John began negotiations with Innocent, but, finding that he demanded unconditional surrender, stopped them and took over all ecclesiastical properties and incomes. He did leave the clergy sufficient to live, though barely; but he still gained a large increment to his usual finances. In November 1209 the Pope took the final step of excommjunicating the King, which, in that it made him an outlaw in Christendom, did far more damage than the Interdict.<br />
 <br />
John used his enlarged treasury to restore order in Scotland, Ireland and Wales, and to rebuild the old alliance with Otto IV of Germany and the Count of Flanders against Philip Augustus. He planned a two-pronged attack on France, to take place in 1212. But that year turned out an unlucky one for John, for the barons again refused to serve abroad, and the army he had was needed to put down a revolt in Wales; the Pope was threatening to demote him, and Philip Augustus was planning a massive invasion of England. John had to give in in one direction, for the prssure was much too great: he chose the Pope, and wisely so. He agreed to return to the status quo in the matter of church property and establishment, and to pay compensation; he further resigned his kingdom into the hands of the Pope, to receive it back in return for his homage and an annual tribute of 1,000 marks (a mark being two-thirds of a pound].<br />
 <br />
He had won a notable ally in Innocent III, who supported him faithfully throughout his troubles. Then his fleet, his own creation, had the good luck to find the French fleet at anchor and unprotected, destroyed it, and so made a French invasion impossible. On the crest of a wave, John determined to put his two-pronged invasion plan into action, but once more the northern barons refused to play, and he set off to punish them. Stephen Langton had arrived on the scene by now and managed to persuade John not to provoke the barons further.<br />
 <br />
In 1214 he finally managed to put his long cherished plan into action, but the two attacks were not properly coordinated; Otto was defeated at Bouvines, and John was deserted by his Poitevin knights.<br />
 <br />
In 1215 John faced a baronage in turmoil: they could point to the failure of his expensive schemes, he ascribed his failure to their total lack of support. The situation could not be more tense. John's nervousness can be seen in his taking of the cross, a blatant attempt to reinforce his alliance with the papacy. In April the Northerners met at Stamford; they were by now a mixture of northerners and southerners--the name was now merely a nickname--but by and large they were the younger element in the kingdom, roughnecks out for a spree. They moved south and were let into London by a faction, and received the expected encouragement from Philip Augustus in the form of siege engines brought over by one Eustace, a renegade monk turned pirate.<br />
 <br />
John offered arbitration, but the barons turned it down, and while he put his faith in an appeal to Rome, Stephen Langton, in cooperation with William Marshal and other more stable and sensible barons, were working on the Northerners' demands to incorporate them into a general charter, which would not only govern feudal relationships, but would also lay down a more general pattern of legality in government. On 15 June John fixed his seal to the draft of Magna Carta, and on 19 June attested copies were sent to all parts of the kingdom.<br />
 <br />
The King did his part thoroughly, though for how long he would have continued is another matter, but the barons continued to distrust him. They remained in arms, organising tournaments as their excuse, saying that the prize would be 'a bear a certain lady would send.' This was civil war, and John took to it with a fiendish glee. He reduced the north and the east, and was about to mop up the remainder of the opposition in London when Philip Augustus' son Louis landed in force to help the barons (May 1216). John had been riding hard for months, and was sick with dysentery after a bout of over-eating; whilst crossing the Wash, the whole of his baggage-train was lost. At Neward Castle on 18 October, he died, desiring to be buried near his patron saint Wulfstan in Worcester Cathedral.<br />
 <br />
He was by no means a good man, and his energies could well have been put to a better use, but in a different situation he might well have made a great king. His constant failure was discipline, over himself first, and others second. John reminds me of nothing so much as the type of person who is brilliant in many ways, and has many gifts, but leaves after two terms 'not suited to teaching in this type of school.'

In 1858 and 1850 the "Watchman and Evangelist" was published atLouisville by A.F. Cox.  This paper merged with the "Missouri CumberlandPresbyterian" and the new paper was called the "St. Louis Observer."<br />
--------------------<br />
The Platte County Sentinel was established in Weston in 1861 by A. F. Cox.  Cox was an extreme abolitionist and used the columns of his paper to denouce every one who differed from him on the subject of slavery.  He moved his paper to Platte Cinty in March 1864 and secured the country printing but his properity was short lived.  His building was burned by troops from Kansas.<br />

Don't ask, because Suzan Heglin can't tell you why, or when, she fell in love with driftwood beach huts.<br />
"I just started taking pictures because they were cute," she said.<br />
Before long, Heglin found she had quite the collection of photos; enough to maybe consider it an obsession.<br />
This year, 2008, marks the second year she's self-published a calendar of driftwood beach hut photographs through the online site www.lulu.com and she already looks to have enough photos for a 2009 version.<br />
A description on lulu.com states, "The unique calendars depict the beautiful and fanciful architecture of the huts created entirely of driftwood along the coast of the Pacific Northwest. They represent the primal longing for home and shelter, and the most romantic dreams in the most evocative places."<br />
"At this point it's really an obsession," Heglin admits.<br />
Suzan Heglin grew up in the Northridge-San Fernando area of California, but she has been a resident of Boulder, Colo., for the last 14 years.<br />
Every three months or so she can be found back on Whidbey, visiting her parents, Bobbie and Howard Heglin, who have called Oak Harbor home for close to 30 years. It is then when this writer of more than 20 years migrates to becoming a driftwood hut photographer.<br />
Heglin considers her photography of the driftwood structures as ethnography of sorts.<br />
"I tried to find any pictures on the Web or any other way people had documented driftwood huts but I couldn't,"  she said.<br />
The driftwood calendars aren't the first major publication for this veteran writer. In 2006 she published a book that had been on the back burner for 16 years, "Paula: The Lighthouse Years." The book distributed by Xlibris, is based on the true story Paula, the Estonian mail order bride of an Alaskan lighthouse keeper and their life in the 1930's.<br />
Heglin was drawn to do her calendar by a fascination with the variety in driftwood architecture.<br />
"Why are people compelled to build them," she wonders. "They're not functional, they can't necessarily protect you from the rain."<br />
And they come in all shapes and sizes: some rounded, some A-frame, some rectangular and some without entrances.<br />
"I had no idea how they intended to get in, or if they did at all," she said.<br />
Some of the huts appear simply as piles of driftwood, others are intricate creations that obviously took a lot of time. Some are accompanied by additional driftwood creativity.<br />
"One beach had skeletons in the trees that were made from driftwood and dressed as pirates," she said.<br />
Heglin also studies the altars she said often reside inside the tiny huts.<br />
"They're usually beautiful with all kinds of shells and bits of other stuff," she said. "You can't help but feel compelled to add something to it."<br />
She has to do it quickly, however, because there's often someone waiting in the car while she quickly scans and photographs the beach.<br />
"They don't let me wander too much," she said.<br />
Heglin herself has never made a driftwood hut.<br />
"I've made sand castles," she said.<br />
An explanation for both her fascination and her lack of driftwood hut building experience could lie in where she resides.<br />
"There's no equivalent in Colorado," she said. " But I am interested in tree houses, too."<br />
She can, however, give you some tips on what she's observed over time.<br />
1) The windward side of Whidbey (or any other island) is the best for hut building.<br />
"That's where all the driftwood is," she said.<br />
2) Certain beaches tend to stick with certain styles of design.<br />
"The huts are always a little rounder at City Beach and more angular at Fort Casey," she said.<br />
3) It's against driftwood hut etiquette for people to tear them down.<br />
"That'd be horrible, but if you want to add to the structure or alter it, that's OK," she said.<br />
Heglin has long wondered why people build the huts, but has never found any answers.<br />
"The builders are always gone by the time I get there," she said.<br />
The answers may be coming soon. Heglin wants to hear from people who have built driftwood huts. She wants to know why you did it, how you did it, what your structure looked like and what you used it for (shelter?).<br />
She plans to incorporate these stories, along with her photos and poetry she writes about driftwood, into a new project.<br />
"There's something here that's so unique and beautiful," she said. "It has to continue."<br />

From Wikipedia<br />
 <br />
Rollo (c.860 - c.932) was the Frankish-Latin name taken by (probably) Hrolf Ganger (Hrolf the Walker, Old Norse: Hrólfr Rögnvaldsson and Göngu-Hrólfr, Norwegian: Gange-Rolf). He has also been called "Rollo the Gangler" in some works, or occasionally "Robert".<br />
 <br />
Rollo was a Viking leader, probably (based on Icelandic sources) from Norway, the son of Ragnvald, Earl of Moer; sagas mention a Hrolf, son of Ragnvald jarl of Moer. However, the latinization Rollo has in no known instance been applied to a Hrolf, and in the texts which speak of him, numerous latinized Hrolfs are included. Dudo of St. Quentin (by most accounts a more reliable source, and at least more recent and living nearer the regions concerned), in his Gesta Normannorum, tells of a powerful Danish (here called Dacian which often happened in medieval sources) nobleman at loggerheads with the king of Denmark (Dacia), who then died and left his two sons, Gurim and Rollo, leaving Rollo to be expelled and Gurim killed.(1) With his followers (known as Normans, or northmen), Rollo invaded the area of northern France now known as Normandy. Wace, writing some 300 years after the event, gives a Scandinavian origin, as does the Orkneyinga Saga, Danish or Norwegian most likely.<br />
 <br />
Concluding the Treaty of Saint-Clair-sur-Epte (911) with the French king Charles the Simple, Rollo pledged feudal allegiance to the king, changed his name to the Frankish version, and converted to Christianity, probably with the baptismal name Robert. In return he was granted the lower Seine area (today's upper Normandy) and the titular rulership of Normandy, centred around the city of Rouen. There exists some argument among historians as to whether Rollo was a "duke" (dux) or whether his position was equivalent to that of a "count" under Charlemagne. According to legend, when required, in conformity with general usage, to kiss the foot of King Charles, he refused to stoop to what he considered so great a degradation; yet as the homage could not be dispensed with, he ordered one of his warriors to perform it for him. The latter, as proud as his chief, instead of stooping to the royal foot, raised it so high, that the King fell to the ground.<br />
 <br />
Sometime around 927 he passed the Duchy of Normandy to his son, William Longsword. He may have lived for a few years after that, but certainly died before 933.<br />
 <br />
He was a direct ancestor of William the Conqueror. By William, he was a direct ancestor of the present-day British royal family, including Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.<br />

Ragnvald Eysteinsson, The Wise (830-890) (Old Norse: Rögnvaldr Mærajarl),Earl of Sunnmøre, Nordmøre and Romsdal, was born in Maer Nord-Trøndelag,Norway and died at the Orkney Islands.<br />
 <br />
He was son of Eystein Glumra the Noisy, Earl of Oppland, and grandson of Halfdan the Old.<br />
 <br />
His second wife was Ragnhild Ragnhild Hrolfsdottir (Raghldr (Hldr) Hrolfsdóttir) daughter of Hrolfr Nefjaa. Ragnvald was the father of Hrolf Ganger, the founder of Normandy. He was also the father of Turf-Einar, the ancestor of the jarls of Orkney.<br />
 <br />
He was the direct ancestor to William I of England, Edward III of England, James I of England, and, therefore, Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. He is therefore the ancestor of most of the royal families of Europe.<br />

Philippa of Hainault (~1314 - August 15, 1369) was the Queen consort ofEdward III of England.<br />
 <br />
Philippa was born in Valenciennes (then in Flanders, now France) and was the daughter of William III, Count of Hainaut and Jeanne de Valois, the grandaughter of Philip III of France. She married Edward at York Minster, on October, 1327, nine months after his accession to the English throne and, unlike many of her predecessors, she did not alienate the English people by retaining her foreign retinue upon her marriage or bringing large numbers of foreigners to the English court.<br />
 <br />
Philippa accompanied Edward on his expeditions to Scotland (1333) and Flanders (1338-40), where she won acclaim for her gentleness and compassion. She is also remembered by history as the tender-hearted woman, who interceded with her husband and persuaded him to spare the lives of the Burghers of Calais whom he had planned to execute as an example to the townspeople.<br />
 <br />
Philippa and Edward had thirteen children, including five sons who lived into adulthood and whose rivalry would eventually bring about the long-running civil wars known as the Wars of the Roses.<br />

Edward III (13 November 1312 - 21 June 1377) was one of the mostsuccessful English kings of medieval times. His fifty-year reign beganwhen his father Edward II of England was deposed on 25 January 1327, andlasted until 1377. Among his immediate predecessors, only Henry III ruledas long, and it would be over 400 years before another monarch wouldoccupy the throne for that duration. Edward's reign was marked by anexpansion of English territory through wars in Scotland and France.Edward's parentage and his prodigious offspring provided the basis fortwo lengthy and significant events in British and European history, theHundred Years' War and the Wars of the Roses, respectively.<br />

Early life<br />
Edward, the son of Edward II of England and Isabella of France, daughter of King Philip the Fair, was born in Windsor Castle. In 1320, he was created Earl of Chester. In 1325, his father ceded the Duchy of Aquitaine to him, and the young Edward was sent to France along with his mother to meet his uncle, the French King Charles IV.<br />
 <br />
Upon their return from France, the powerful Queen and her lover, Roger Mortimer, forced the weak and unpopular Edward II to abdicate, installing Edward III as king in 1327.<br />
 <br />
Edward II was subsequently murdered, and Isabella and Roger Mortimer effectively ruled England during the young king's first few years on the throne.<br />
 <br />
Early reign<br />
Edward III was crowned on January 25, 1327, at the age of 14, and married Philippa of Hainault, in 1328. The couple eventually produced thirteen children, including five sons who reached maturity. Their eldest son and Edward's heir, Edward the Black Prince, born in 1330, would become a famed military leader. In the same year as Edward's marriage, his uncle Charles IV of France died without male heirs, leaving a pregnant wife, thus making Edward (through Isabella) the senior surviving male descendant of King Philip IV, Charles' and Isabella's father, and potentially giving Edward the senior Capetian dynasty claim to the French throne. (Edward's younger brother John, Earl of Cornwall, was then the only other living male descending from Philip IV. Later, daughters of Louis X and Philip V produced further male issue, such as King Charles II of Navarre, Hereditary Duke Philip of Burgundy and Count Louis of Flanders.)<br />
 <br />
In 1330, the eighteen-year old Edward seized control over the English court, overthrowing Mortimer, who was executed, and removing Isabella from power but sparing her life.<br />
 <br />
The reign of Edward III was marked by continued war with Scotland, but much more by the war with France. His first major military success was the Battle of Halidon Hill in 1333, which he won in support of his puppet, the new Scottish king, Edward Balliol, in detriment to his own brother-in-law David II of Scotland, the Bruce claimant and husband of Edward's sister Joan of the Tower, princess of England.<br />
 <br />
The Hundred Years' War<br />
Edward's claim to unite the English and French thrones was contested by French nobles who invoked Salic law, which held that the royal succession could not pass through a female line (such as Edward's mother Isabella, or Queen Joan II of Navarre), and who therefore asserted that the legitimate King of France was Philip VI, Edward's cousin and heir to Charles of Valois, a younger son of Philip III.<br />
 <br />
Edward declared war on Philip VI in 1337, and declared himself king of France on January 26, 1340. The conflict thus commenced eventually became known as the Hundred Years' War, continuing sporadically to the 1450s. In 1346, Edward defeated the French at the Battle of Crecy, accompanied in this campaign by his sixteen year old son the Black Prince.<br />
 <br />
The Black Prince commanded England's victorious army at the Battle of Poitiers, in 1356. The first phase of the Hundred Years' War was concluded in 1360 with the Treaty_of_Brétigny, marking the height of English influence in France and providing three million crowns' ransom for the capture of the French King John II.<br />
 <br />
While these victories were eventually reversed, and then won and lost again in the resulting generations of war, British monarchs would continue to claim the title "King of France" until the Act of Union which led to the creation of the United Kingdom in 1801. Edward III quartered his coat of arms with "France Ancient", the Azure semé-de-lis (a blue shield with a tight pattern of small golden fleur de lis of the French royal house), and it remained a part of the English Coat of Arms until removed by George III. For more information see English Kings of France.<br />
 <br />
Domestic events and personal life<br />
While the king and the prince campaigned abroad, the government was left largely in the hands of the prince's younger brother, John of Gaunt. Economic prosperity from the developing wool trade created new wealth in the kingdom, but the ravages of the bubonic plague, or Black Death, had a significant impact on the lives of his subjects. Commercial taxes became a major source of royal revenue, which had previously been largely from taxes on land. Parliament became divided into two houses. During Edward's reign, French was still the language of the English noblesse following the Norman invasion, but this was changed.<br />
 <br />
The king also founded an order of knighthood, the Order of the Garter, allegedly as a result of an incident when a lady, with whom he was dancing at a court ball, dropped an item of intimate apparel (possibly a sanitary belt, though sources describe it as being made of velvet). Gallantly picking it up to assuage her embarrassment, Edward tied it around his own leg, and remarked Honi soit qui mal y pense ('Shame on him who thinks evil of it'), which became the motto of the Order of the Garter. The woman in the case is known only as the "Countess of Salisbury". Some say it was Edward's daughter-in-law, Joan of Kent, but a more likely candidate is Joan's mother-in-law from her first marriage.<br />
 <br />
Despite having an unusually happy marriage, and producing thirteen children with Philippa, Edward was a notorious womaniser. After Philippa's death in 1369, Edward's mistress, Alice Perrers, became a byword for corruption.<br />
 <br />
Facing a resurgent French monarchy and losses in France, Edward asked parliament to grant him more funds by taxing the wine and wool trades, but this was badly received in 1374-1375 as a new outbreak of bubonic plague struck. The "Good Parliament" of 1376 criticised Edward's councillors, including Alice Perrers' family, and advised him to limit his ambitions to suit his revenues.<br />
 <br />
Edward died of a stroke in 1377 and was buried in Westminster Abbey. The Prince Edward pre-deceased him in 1376, and Edward III was succeeded by his young grandson, King Richard II of England, son of Edward the Black Prince.<br />
 <br />
The sons and the Wars of the Roses<br />
The Wars of the Roses were a civil war over the throne of England fought among the descendants of King Edward III through his five surviving adult sons. Each branch of the family had competing claims through seniority, legitimacy, and/or the gender of their ancestors.<br />
 <br />
(1) Edward, the Black Prince (1330-1376), Duke of Cornwall, Prince of Wales<br />
    The eldest son of Edward III predeceased his father and never became king. Edward's only surviving child was Richard II who ascended to the throne but produced no heirs. Richard II designated as his heir presumptive his cousin Roger Mortimer, 4th Earl of March, senior heir in female line, the grandson of Lionel of Antwerp, but this succession never took place as Richard II was eventually deposed and succeeded by another of Richard's cousins: Henry IV, "Bolingbroke", who was senior heir in male line.<br />
 <br />
(2) William (16 February 1335-8 July 1335), he was buried at the cathedral by York.<br />
 <br />
(3) Lionel of Antwerp (1338-1368), Duke of Clarence<br />
    Lionel also predeceased his father. Lionel's only child, Philippa, married into the powerful Mortimer family, which as noted above had exerted enormous influence during the reigns of Edward II and Edward III, and Philippa's son Roger Mortimer, 4th Earl of March was the designated heir of Richard II (but predeceased him, leaving his young son Edmund as heir presumptive. Anne Mortimer, Edmund's eldest sister, Lionel of Antwerp's great-granddaughter, married Richard, Earl of Cambridge of the House of York, merging the Lionel/Mortimer line into the York line.<br />
 <br />
(4) John of Gaunt (1340-1399), Duke of Lancaster.<br />
    From John of Gaunt descended legitimate male heirs, the Lancasters (Henry IV, who deposed Richard II, and then Henry V and Henry VI). This line ended when Henry VI was successfully deposed by Edward IV, of the York faction, and Henry's son was killed. The Lancaster Kings derived their ancestry also, through Blanche, wife of John Gaunt, from Edmund of Lancaster the Crouchback, who was son of Henry III of England - a legend without foundation was developed to claim that Edmund was elder than his brother Edward I but overpassed in succession of Henry III because of physical infirmity.<br />
 <br />
    John of Gaunt's illegitimate heirs were the Beauforts, his descendants through his mistress (later, his wife) Katherine Swynford; Gaunt's great-granddaughter Margaret Beaufort married into the House of Tudor, producing a single child who would become Henry VII. While the Beaufort offspring had been legitimized after Gaunt's eventual marriage to Swynford, this was on the condition that they be barred from ascending the throne. Undeterred by this, upon the failure of the primary Lancastrian line, the Tudors claimed precedence to the Yorks and eventually succeeded them.<br />
 <br />
    [Note: John of Gaunt also had legitimate descendants through his daughters Philippa, Queen of Portugal, the mother of King Duarte of Portugal, Elizabeth, Duchess of Exeter, the mother of John Holland, 2nd Duke of Exeter, and Queen Catalina of Castile, a grand-daughter of King Pedro I and the mother of King Juan II, but these Castilians engaged in their own wars over the Spanish succession and did not assert any claims to the English throne in the Wars of the Roses - and they all were of female line, something the Lancaster Claim avoided because they were originally secondary to certain senior female descents such as Mortimers.]<br />
 <br />
(5) Edmund of Langley (1341-1402), Duke of York.<br />
    His descendants were the Yorks. He had two sons: Edward, Duke of York, killed fighting alongside Henry V at the battle of Agincourt, and Richard, Earl of Cambridge, executed by Henry V for treason (involving a plot to place heir presumptive Edmund Mortimer, 5th Earl of March, Cambridge's brother-in-law and cousin, on the throne). As noted above, Richard had married Anne Mortimer, this giving their son and the House of York, through Lionel of Antwerp, a more senior claim than that of both the Lancasters, who were descended from a younger son than Lionel, and the Tudors, whose legitimized Beaufort ancestors had been debarred from the throne.<br />
 <br />
(6) Thomas (1347).<br />
 <br />
(7) William (24 June 1348-5 September 1348).<br />
 <br />
(8) Thomas of Woodstock (1355-1397), Duke of Gloucester.<br />
    Thomas, who was one of the Lords Appellant influential under Richard II, was murdered or executed for treason, likely by the order of Richard II; his eventual heir was his daughter Anne, who married into the Stafford family, whose heirs became the Dukes of Buckingham. Henry Stafford, 2nd Duke of Buckingham, descended on his father's side from Thomas of Woodstock, and on his mother's side from John Beaufort, rebelled against Richard III in 1483 but failed to depose him. This failed rebellion left Henry Tudor as the Lancasters' primary candidate for the throne.<br />
 <br />
Thus, the senior Plantagenet line was ended with the death of Richard II, but not before the execution of Thomas of Woodstock for treason. The heirs presumptive through Lionel of Antwerp were passed over in favour of the powerful Henry IV, descendant of Edward III through John of Gaunt. These Lancaster Kings initially survived the treason of their Edmund of Langley (York) cousins but eventually were deposed by the merged Lionel/Edmund line in the person of Edward IV. Internecine killing among the Yorks left Richard III as King, supported and then betrayed by his cousin Buckingham the descendant of Thomas of Woodstock. Finally, the Yorks were dislodged by the remaining Lancastrian candidate, Henry VII of the House of Tudor, another descendant of John of Gaunt, who married the eldest daughter of Yorkist King Edward IV.<br />

Ragnvald the Mountain-High was a petty king of Westfold in what is todayNorway. He was the son of Olaf Geirstad-Alf and the cousin of HaraldFairhair.<br />
 <br />
His greatest contribution to posterity was that he asked the skald jóđólfr of Hvinir to compose a poem about his ancestry. This poem is known as Ynglingatal and is not only one of the oldest, but also one of the most famous and debated of the Old Norse poems.<br />
 <br />
jóđólfr ended the poem with these lines:<br />
    Under the heaven's blue dome, a name<br />
    I never knew more true to fame<br />
    Than Rognvald bore; whose skilful hand<br />
    Could tame the scorners of the land, --<br />

Katherine (or Katharine or Catherine) (c. 1350 - 1403) was the daughterof Payne (or Paen) de Roet (or Rouet or Roelt) a Flemish herald fromHainault who was knighted just before dying in the wars, leavingKatherine and her older sister Philippa, as well as a brother, Walter,and eldest sister, Isabel (Elizabeth) de Roet, (who died chanoinness ofthe convent of St. Waudru's, Mons, c. 1366). About the year 1366, at theage of 16, Katherine married Hugh Swynford or Synford, an English knightfrom the manor of Kettlethorpe in Lincolnshire, and bore him at least twochildren (Blanch, Thomas, and likely the Margaret Swynford who wasnominated a nun at the prestigious Barking Abbey by the command ofRichard II in 1377) before he, too, died in the European wars. She thenbecame attached to the household of John of Gaunt, Duke of Lancaster,ostensibly as governess to his two daughters (the sisters of the futureHenry IV of England) by his first wife Blanche, but eventually she becamehis official mistress. Katherine's sister Philippa married the poetGeoffrey Chaucer, whose poem The Book of the Duchess commemoratedBlanche's death in about 1369.<br />
 <br />
Long after the death of his second wife Constance (or Constanza) of Castile, John and Katherine married in January 1396, three years before he died. The four children Katherine had borne John of Gaunt had been given the surname "Beaufort" and were already adults when they were legitimized (but barred from inheriting the throne by a clause inserted by half-brother Henry IV well into the latter's reign) in 1390:<br />
 <br />
    * John Beaufort, 1st Earl of Somerset.<br />
    * Henry Cardinal Beaufort.<br />
    * Thomas Beaufort, 1st Duke of Exeter.<br />
    * Joan Beaufort, Countess of Westmorland.<br />
 <br />
Her son John was the great-grandfather of Henry VII of England and the grandfather of James II of Scotland; her daughter Joan Beaufort was the grandmother of Edward IV of England and Richard III of England, whom Henry VII defeated to take the throne. (Henry then married Elizabeth of York, daughter of Edward IV, and their son became Henry VIII of England). Her step-son became Henry IV of England by deposing Richard II of England (who was imprisoned and died shortly thereafter, in Pontefract Castle, where Katherine's son Thomas Swynford was constable, and he was said to have starved Richard to death for his step-brother); her step-daughter, John and Constance's daughter Catherine (or Catalina), was the great-grandmother of Catherine of Aragon, the first wife of Henry VIII of England and mother of Mary I of England.<br />
 <br />
Katherine survived John by only four years, dying on May 10, 1403. (Since she was then dowager Duchess of Lancaster, there was a record of the exact day, as there was not for her birth, when she was a nobody.) Her tomb, and that of her daughter Joan Beaufort, are under a carved-stone canopy in the sanctuary of Lincoln Cathedral, but their remains are no longer in them, because the tombs were despoiled in 1644, during the English Civil War, by the Roundheads.<br />

John of Gaunt, 1st Duke of Lancaster (June 24, 1340 - February 3, 1399),the third surviving son of King Edward III of England, he gained his namebecause he was born at Ghent in 1340. He became Duke of Lancaster by hisfirst marriage to his cousin, Blanche (1359), heiress to the Palatinateof Lancaster, a title which gave its holder considerable independencefrom the crown. John became a fabulously wealthy prince with thirtycastles and vast estates across England and France. His household wascomparable in scale and organization to that of a monarch.<br />
 <br />
After the death of his elder brother, Edward, the Black Prince, John of Gaunt became increasingly powerful. He contrived to protect the religious reformer, John Wyclif, with whose aims he sympathized. However, Gaunt's ascendancy to political power coincided with widespread resentment at his influence. At a time when English forces encountered setbacks in the Hundred Years' War against France and Edward III's rule had started to become domestically unpopular due to high taxation and to the King's affair with Alice Perrers, political opinion closely associated the Duke of Lancaster with the failing government of the 1370s. Furthermore, while the king and the Prince of Wales had the status of popular heroes due to their success on the battlefield, Gaunt had never known any such military success which might have bolstered his reputation.<br />
 <br />
When King Edward III died (1377) and John's nephew, the ten-year-old Richard II of England, succeeded to the throne, Gaunt's influence strengthened further, but mistrust remained and some suspected him of wanting to seize the throne for himself. He took pains to ensure that he never became associated with the opposition to Richard's kingship, but as virtual ruler of England during Richard's minority, some unwise decisions on taxation led to the Peasants' Revolt in 1381, during which the rebels destroyed his Savoy Palace.<br />
 <br />
In 1386, Richard, who had by now assumed more power for himself, dispatched Gaunt to Spain as an ambassador. However, crisis ensued almost immediately and in 1387 Richard's misrule took the country to the brink of civil war. Only John of Gaunt, on his return to England, was able to bring about a compromise between the Lords Appellant and King Richard, ushering in a period of stability and relative harmony. During the 1390s, John of Gaunt's reputation of devotion to the well-being of the kingdom became much restored. Gaunt died of natural causes on February 3 1399 at Leicester Castle, with his beloved third wife Katherine by his side. Their abiding love and union altered the course of English history as we know it today.<br />
 <br />
John of Gaunt's later marriages and descendants<br />
Blanche died in 1369. In 1371, John married Constanza of Castile, daughter of King Peter I of Castile, thus giving him a claim on the kingdom of Castile, which he would pursue unsuccessfully.<br />
 <br />
In the meantime, John of Gaunt had fathered four children by a mistress, Katherine Swynford (whose sister married the poet, Geoffrey Chaucer). Constanza died in 1394. He married Katherine in 1396 or 1397, and their children, the Beauforts, were legitimized but barred from inheriting the throne. From the eldest son, John, came a granddaughter, Margaret Beaufort, whose son, later King Henry VII of England, would nevertheless claim the throne.<br />
 <br />
John of Gaunt's legitimate son from his first marriage, Henry Bolingbroke, proved less of a diplomat than his father, and Richard II banished him from the kingdom in 1398. When John of Gaunt died in 1399, his estates were declared forfeit to the crown. This caused Bolingbroke to return, and he deposed the unpopular Richard to reign as King Henry IV of England (1399-1413).<br />

King William sought aggressive types for the office of sheriff whoseambitions were consistant with his. Those willing to squeeze the peasantsto their maximum were the best qualified in William's eyes. He institutedthe practice of selling the office to the highest bidder. This broughtforth evil men willing to pay exorbitant prices for the office and thenwilling to do whatever it took to recoup their investment ... No onespoke out for the peaseantry because their only representative to theking was the very sheriffs embezzling them. The most notorious was Picot,Sheriff of Cambridgeshire ...

Joan Beaufort, Countess of Westmorland, (c.1379 - 13 November 1440), wasthe fourth child (and only daughter) of John of Gaunt and his mistressKatherine Swynford. Joan married Robert Ferrers, 3rd Baron Ferrers ofWemme, and they had two daughters before he died. Along with her threebrothers, Joan was privately declared legitimate by their cousin RichardII of England in 1390, but for some reason their father secured anothersuch declaration from Parliament in January 1397. Perhaps the reason wasthat on 3 February 1397, when she was 18, Joan married Ralph Neville, 1stEarl of Westmorland, who had also been married once before. They had atleast ten children, one of whom was Cecily Neville (1415 - 1495) ("ProudCis"), who married Richard, Duke of York (1411 - 1460), and two of theirchildren became Edward IV of England and Richard III of England.<br />
 <br />
Joan died on 13 November 1440 and was entombed next to her mother in the sanctuary of Lincoln Cathedral. Joan's is the smaller of the two tombs; both were decorated with brass plates -- full-length representations of them on the tops, and small shields bearing coats of arms around the sides -- but those were damaged or destroyed in 1644 during the English Civil War. A 1640 drawing of them survives, showing what the tombs looked like when they were intact, and side-by-side instead of end-to-end, as they are now.<br />

Hengest or Hengist (d. 488?) was a semi-legendary ruler of Kent insoutheast England.<br />
 <br />
The facts of his life are unknown, but according to Bede (writing nearly 200 years after the events in question), he and his brother Horsa were mercenaries for the British ruler Vortigern, hired to fight against the Picts. Following his victories over the Picts, Hengest invited more immigrants from Germany to settle in Britain and then rebelled against Vortigern, establishing himself as king in Kent.<br />
 <br />
Both Hengest and Horsa are described as being Jutes, and sons of a Jutish chief named Wihtgils.<br />
 <br />
The actual historical existence of both Hengest and Horsa has been called into question numerous times, with many historians labeling these two as legendary 'divine twins' or culture heros along the order of Romulus and Remus. It is perhaps more likely that Hengest, meaning 'Stallion' in Old English (in modern German 'Hengst' is still the word for a stallion), was an honorific for an actual warlord, while Horsa was a later accretion to the story, perhaps as a misreading of a gloss in a manuscript that was written to define the name Hengest as meaning 'horse'.<br />
 <br />
Later accounts, in the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, the Historia Britonum, by Geoffrey of Monmouth, and by Robert Wace add further details from tradition and legend about Hengest's career. The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle dates his death to 488, but does not provide a cause; according to some tellings of the Arthurian legend, he was killed by the British king Uther Pendragon.<br />

Oisc (alternately Oeric or Aesc) was an early King of Kent who ruled fromabout 488 to about 516.<br />
 <br />
Little is known about him, and the information that does survive regarding his life is often vague and suspect. He seems to have been the son or the grandson of Hengest, who led the initial Jutish conquest and settlement of Kent. Oisc was evidently regarded by later generations as having been the founder of the kingdom or of the royal line, since his descendants called themselves "Oiscingas" after him.<br />
 <br />
He was said to have been a leader of the Anglo-Saxons at the Battle of Mons Badonicus, in which they were defeated by the native Britons. In fact, he was the only one of their kings whose participation in this battle was recorded.<br />

 <br />
Charibert (c.517 - November or December 567), king of the Franks, was the second eldest son of Clotaire I and Ingonde. (Their eldest son was Gunthar, who died sometime before his father's death.)<br />
 <br />
On Clotaire's death in 561, his estates were divided among his sons in a new configuration, Charibert receiving the kingdom between the Somme and the Loire, with Paris as his capital, together with Rouen and Tours, with the Aquitaine and Novempopulana to its south, with the cities of Poitiers, Limoges, Bordeaux, and Toulouse, Cahors and Albi.<br />
 <br />
Though the election of bishops in Merovingian territories was subject to manipulation and veto by the king, once consecrated, the bishops were in control within the cities, though perhaps not all as firmly as at Tours, where bishop Gregory, invoking the wrath of Saint Martin, was able to extract a coronation promise on oath from Charibert:<br />
 <br />
    "that he would not burden the people with new laws and customs, but he would retain only those under which they had previously lived in the time of his father; and he promised that he would not impose upon them any new ordinance which would result in loss to them." - Gregory of Tours.<br />
 <br />
Thus hampered in raising funds (largely as gifts in kind anyway) and under such obligations not to create innovative policy or law, the Merovingian kings' sphere of operations was severely limited.<br />
 <br />
Besides his wife, Ingoberga, with whom he had a daughter, Berthe, or Aldeberge, (539-ca 612), he had unions with Merofleda, a wool-carder's daughter and her sister (precipitating his ban of excommunication, the first ever levelled at a Merovingian king), and Theodogilda, the daughter of a neatherd (cowherd). Charibert was scarcely more than "king at Paris" when he married his daughter Berthe to Aethelbert, the pagan king of Kent, who probably came to his throne in A.D. 560. She took with her,Bishop Liudhard, as her private confessor. According to Bede, Aethelbert's supremacy in 597 stretched over all the petty English kingdoms as far as the Humber; whether this is an exaggeration or not, it was at any rate sufficient to guarantee the safety of Augustine when in 597 the mission of Augustine landed in Thanet. The Christian mission was received at first with some hesitation by the king, who gave Augustine a dwelling-place in Canterbury, and the Christian conversion, first of Kent, then of other Anglo-Saxons proceeded from there, thanks to Charibert's daughter.<br />
 <br />
Though Charibert was eloquent and learned in the law, he was one of the most dissolute of the Merovingian kings, his early death in 567, under a ban of excommunication, being brought on by his excesses. He was buried at the abbey of Saint-Vincent (later Saint-Germain-des-Pres, then outside Paris. At his death his brothers Guntram, Sigebert I, and Chilperic I shared his realm, agreeing at first to hold Paris in common. His surviving queen (out of four), Theudechild, proposed a marriage with Guntram, though a council held at Paris as recently as 557 had outlawed such tradition as incestuous. Guntram decided to house her more safely, though unwillingly, in a nunnery at Arles.<br />

Berthe, Princess of Paris, also Bertha, Queen of Kent, (539-c.612) wasone of Charibert's daughters. In marrying the pagan King Ethelbert ofKent, she brought her chaplain Liudhard with her, and restored aChristian church in Canterbury, which dated form the Roman occupation,dedicating it to St. Martin. The present St. Martin's at Canterburyoccupies the same site. Saint Augustine, who was sent by Gregory theGreat to preach the Gospel in England in 596, owed much of his favourablereception there to the influence of Berthe.<br />
She seems to have had two children:<br />
    * Eadbald of Kent<br />
    * Ethelberg of Kent<br />

Ethelbert (or Æthelbert, or Aethelberht) (c. 552 - February 24, 6161) wasKing of Kent from around 580 or 590 until his death. After his death, hewas regarded as a saint.<br />
 <br />
He was the son of Eormenric, whom he succeeded as king, according to the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle. Gregory of Tours, who was a close acquaintance of Queen Ingoberg (the mother of Ethelbert's wife Berthe), twice calls him simply "a man of Kent", indicating that he was not king at the time Gregory's History of the Franks was written, and that Ethelbert more likely became king closer to 590.<br />
 <br />
The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle records that he attempted at one stage to wrest the position of Bretwalda from Ceawlin of Wessex but was unsuccessful. His standing was advanced by his marriage with Berthe, daughter of Charibert, king of the Franks, thus building an alliance with the most powerful state in Europe at that time. This prestige enabled him to claim the title of Bretwalda after Ceawlin's death.<br />
 <br />
The influence of Berthe, who had brought her chaplain Liuhard (or Letard) with her to Kent, may have led to the invitation to Pope Gregory I to send missionaries from Rome. Augustine landed on the Isle of Thanet in 597, and Ethelbert first met him under an oak tree, in accordance with his belief that he could thus dispel any magic the Christians might attempt. Tradition has it that Augustine baptized Ethelbert only a few days after landing in Kent, although a letter from Gregory to Berthe suggests that it cannot have happened before 601. In any case, churches were established and efforts began to convert the people to Christianity.<br />
 <br />
Ethelbert also established a written code of laws for Kent, the earliest in any Anglo-Saxon kingdom, which provided for the protection of the Church and instituted a complex system of fines. The nature of the law code is evidence that Kent was a relatively organized and centralized kingdom under Ethelbert.<br />
 <br />
Ethelbert was later canonised for his role in restoring Christianity to England. Although he died on February 24, 616, his feast day was usually celebrated on February 25 so that it would not overlap with the feast of Saint Matthias on the previous day.<br />

Cadfan ap Iago (c. 580-625; reigned from c. 615) (Latin: Catamanus; English: Gideon) was a King of Gwynedd. The son of King Iago, he likely assumed the crown of Gwynedd around 615, shortly after the Battle of Caer-Legion (also known as Chester), during which the forces of Gwynedd were defeated by Æthelfrith of Bernicia. Despite Æthelfrith's military victories, Cadfan continued to provide haven for Edwin of Northumbria, whom Æthelfrith regarded as a major threat.<br />
 <br />
Cadfan was generally considered to have been a wise and just ruler, noted for his ability to maintain the rule of law and peace during an increasingly hostile period in British history. His memorial stone at Llangadwaladr Church in Anglesey refers to him as "the wisest and most splendid of all kings." He was succeeded by his son Cadwallon.<br />
 <br />
He was one of the last of the legendary kings of the Britons as accounted by Geoffrey of Monmouth.<br />

Family friends, meanwhile, reported that Mrs. Reagan was in good spiritsand had, in her private conversations, provided additional details aboutthe events after the shooting Monday afternoon.<br />
''Thank God for Jerry,'' friends quoted her as saying. Jerry S. Parr is the Secret Service agent who shoved Mr. Reagan into the Presidential limousine as a gunman sprayed bullets at the Presidential entourage.<br />
The President has told his wife that he felt ''an excruciatingly sharp pain'' in his chest. Mr. Reagan thought he had cracked a rib, when Mr. Parr, with the force of a football lineman, propelled him into the car and piled on top.<br />
As the car raced toward the White House, Mr. Parr said, ''Sit up, Mr. President.'' ''I can't sit up,'' Mr. Reagan told his bodyguard, who then directed the limousine to change course and head for the hospital. Mr. Parr is also credited by Mrs. Reagan with noticing blood on Mr. Reagan's lips, a key in alerting aides that they were wrong in assuming Mr. Reagan unhurt.<br />

Stephen (1096 - October 25, 1154), the last Norman King of England,reigned from 1135 to 1154, when he was succeeded by his cousin Henry II,the first of the Angevin or Plantagenet Kings.<br />
 <br />
Stephen was born at Blois in France, the son of Stephen, Count of Blois, and Adela (daughter of William the Conqueror). His brother was Henry of Blois, bishop of Winchester. Stephen became Count of Mortain in about 1115, and married Matilda, daughter of the Count of Boulogne, in about 1125, who shortly after became Countess of Boulogne. Stephen became joint ruler in 1128. In 1150 he ceased to co-rule, and in 1151, the County was given to his son, Eustace IV. When Eustace died childless, Stephen's next living son, William inherited the territory.<br />
 <br />
Before the death of King Henry I of England in 1135, the majority of the barons of England swore to support Henry's daughter (also named Matilda and granddaughter of William the Conqueror), and her claim to the throne. However, Stephen (also a grandchild of The Conqueror through his mother and who had been raised at Henry's court) laid claim to the throne. He also claimed his uncle, King Henry, had changed his mind on his deathbed, and named Stephen as his heir. Once Stephen was crowned, he gained the support of the majority of the barons as well as Pope Innocent II. The first few years of his reign were peaceful, but by 1139 he was seen as weak and indecisive, setting the country up for a civil war, commonly called The Anarchy.<br />
 <br />
Stephen had many traits that made him seem superficially fit for kingship: his high birth, his descent from the Conqueror, his handsomeness, his bravery and good nature. But he possessed none of the ruthlessness necessary for the ruthless times he lived in; indeed, Walter Map says of Stephen: "He was adept at the martial arts but in other respects little more than a simpleton."<br />
 <br />
Bad omens haunted him before the Battle of Lincoln (2 February 1141). Stephen was facing his rebellious barons Robert, 1st Earl of Gloucester (the Empress' illegitimate half-brother) and the Earl of Chester. He fought so bravely in the battle that his battle-axe shattered. He drew a sword and continued fighting until it broke as well, as he was captured by a knight named William de Cahagnes. Stephen was defeated and he was brought before his cousin, the Empress Matilda.<br />
 <br />
Stephen was imprisoned at Bristol, but his wife, the Countess Matilda, kept faith, and the Empress was soon forced out of London. With the capture of her most able lieutenant, the Earl of Gloucester, Matilda was eventually obliged to release Stephen from captivity, and he was restored to the throne in November of the same year. In December 1142, the Empress was besieged at Oxford, but she managed to escape.<br />
 <br />
In 1147, Empress Matilda's adolescent son, Henry (the eventual King Henry II), decided to assist in the war effort by raising a small army of mercenaries and invading England. Rumors of this army's size terrified Stephen's retainers, although in truth the force was very small. Having been defeated twice in battle, and with no money to pay his mercenaries, the young Henry appealed to his uncle Robert for aid but was turned away. Desperately, and in secret, the boy then asked Stephen for help. According to the Gesta Stephani, "On receiving the message, the king, who was ever full of pity and compassion, hearkened to the young man..." and bestowed upon him money and other support. Despite this generosity, there is no evidence for the rumors that Stephen was Henry's biological father.<br />
 <br />
Stephen maintained his precarious hold on the throne for the remainder of his lifetime. However, following the death of his son and heir, Eustace, in 1153, he was persuaded to reach a compromise with Empress Matilda whereby her son would succeed Stephen on the English throne as King Henry II.<br />
 <br />
Stephen died at Dover, and was buried in Faversham Abbey, which he had founded with Countess Matilda in 1147<br />
 <br />
Besides Eustace, Stephen and Matilda had two other sons, Baldwin (d. before 1135), and William of Blois (Count of Mortain and Boulogne, and Earl of Surrey or Warenne). They also had two daughters, Matilda and Marie of Boulogne. In addition to these children, Stephen fathered at least three illegitimate children, one of whom, Gervase, became Abbot of Westminster.<br />
 <br />
The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle (the Peterborough Chronicle, second continuation) provides a moving and succinct appraisal of Stephen's reign:<br />
 <br />
    "In the days of this King there was nothing but strife, evil, and robbery, for quickly the great men who were traitors rose against him. When the traitors saw that Stephen was a good-humoured, kindly, and easy-going man who inflicted no punishment, then they committed all manner of horrible crimes . . . And so it lasted for nineteen years while Stephen was King, till the land was all undone and darkened with such deeds, and men said openly that Christ and his angels slept".<br />

John Russell, 1st Earl of Bedford, KG, PC, JP (c. 1485 - 14 March1554/1555) was an English royal minister in the Tudor  era. He servedvariously as Lord High Admiral and Lord Privy Seal.<br />
Among lands and property he was given by Henry VIII after the Dissolution of the Monasteries, were the Abbey and town of Tavistock, and the area that is now Covent Garden.<br />
Russell is the ancestor of all subsequent Earls and Dukes of Bedford and Earls Russell, including John Russell, Prime Minister of the United Kingdom and philosopher Bertrand Russell.<br />
John Russell was born c.1485 probably at Berwick-by-Swyre, Dorset, the son James Russell(d. November 1505)[2]  and his 1st wife Alice Wise, da. of Thomas Wise of Sidenham, near Tavistock, Devon.[3]  James's father was possibly William Russell, but more likely his brother John Russell(d.1505) by his wife Alice Froxmere, da. of John Froxmere of Droitwich, Worcs.[4]  John was the son of Henry Russell(d.1463/4), and Elizabeth Herring, da. of John Herring of Chaldon Herring. Henry, great-grandfather of the 1st Earl, was a substantial wine merchant and shipper, who represented Weymouth in the House of Commons 4 times.[5] The Russell pedigree can only be traced back with certainty to Henry Russell's father, Stephen Russell, the evidence being contained in a deed of April 1440 [6]  in which Henry Russell made over to his daughter Cristina and her husband Walter Cheverell of Chauntemarle, a tenement in Dorchester to be held of himself and his heirs upon rent of a red rose. In the deed Henry referred to himself as son and heir of Stephen Russell and of Alice his wife.[7]  This Alice appears to have been the heir general of the De la Tour family,[8]  which had long owned Berwick-by-Swyre, and by whom therefore the manor was brought into the Russell family. Both Henry and Stephen were referred to as Gascoigne as well as Russell, possibly due to their wine trade with France, as in a 1442 pardon under the Privy Seal referring to Henry Russell of Weymouth, merchant, alias Henry Gascoign, gentleman.[9]  It was long believed in the noble Russell family, certainly by the 2nd Earl of Bedford, that the family was descended from the ancient family of Russell of Kingston Russell in Dorset, 3 miles NE of Berwick, which descent was declared unproven by Gladys Scott Thomson, FRHist.Soc., in her Two Centuries of Family History, London (1930), an exhaustive and scholarly work on the early pedigree of the Earls of Bedford. For a disambiguation of the Bedford Russells and the Russells of Kingston Russell, see Kingston Russell.<br />
In 1506 John Russell was of service to Philip of Austria and Juana his wife (King and Queen of Castile) when they were shipwrecked off Weymouth, and was introduced to the Court by them. He became Gentleman of the Privy Chamber to Henry VII in 1507 and Henry VIII in 1509, who employed him in various military and diplomatic missions during the War of the League of Cambrai. He was at the taking of Thérouanne  and Tournai. He was knighted on 2 July 1522 after losing an eye at the taking of Morlaix in Brittany, and he witnessed the Battle of Pavia.<br />
In the spring of 1526, he married Anne Sapcote, widow of John Broughton and of Sir Richard Jerningham, and daughter of Sir Guy Sapcote and his wife Margaret Wolston, and made alterations to Chenies Manor House to reflect his new good fortunes. He now stood in favor with the King and Cardinal Wolsey, though he would not suffer disgrace at the fall of the latter.<br />
He was made Sheriff of Dorset and Somerset in 1528 and served as Member of Parliament for Buckinghamshire 1529-1536, retaining the royal favor despite the antipathy of Anne Boleyn. Late in 1536, he was made a Privy Counsellor, and helped to suppress the Pilgrimage of Grace.<br />
The fall and execution of the Marquess of Exeter left a vacuum of power in the southwestern counties of England, which Russell would be called upon to fill. On 9 March 1538/1539 he was created Baron Russell, and appointed Lord President of the Council of the West. In the next month, he was made a Knight of the Garter. In July 1539 he was made High Steward of Cornwall, and Lord Warden of the Stannaries.<br />
The Council of the West proved unsuccessful as an instrument of government, and did not survive the fall of Cromwell. Russell, however, remained a great magnate in the western counties, and obtained the office of Lord High Admiral in 1540. (The previous holder, the Earl of Southampton, replaced Cromwell as Lord Privy Seal.) After Henry VIII met Anne of Cleves at Rochester, the next day he asked Russell if he thought her fair? Russell replied he took her not to be fair, but of a brown complexion.[11] In 1542, Russell himself resigned the Admiralty and succeeded to the Privy Seal on the death of Southampton. He was High Steward of the University of Oxford from 1543 till his death.<br />
During the Italian War of 1542, he unsuccessfully besieged Montreuil in 1544, and was Captain General of the Vanguard of the army for the attack on Boulogne in 1545. He was a close companion of Henry VIII during the last years of his reign. On Henry's death, he was one of the executors of the King's will, and one of sixteen counsellors during the minority of Edward VI.<br />
On 16 June 1553 he was one of the twenty-six Peers who signed the settlement of the crown on Lady Jane Grey. He was sent to attend Philip II into England on his coming from Spain to wed the Queen.<br />
He died 14 March 1554/1555 and was buried at Chenies, Buckinghamshire, in the private Bedford Chapel of the church next to his manor there.<br />
Russell is the ancestor of all subsequent Earls and Dukes of Bedford and Earls Russell, including John Russell, Prime Minister of the United Kingdom and philosopher Bertrand Russell.<br />
On the dissolution of the greater monasteries Henry VIII granted him lands and properties including the Cistercian Abbey at Dunkeswell, Devon, the Abbey of Tavistock, Devon, and the town of Tavistock. He was also granted seven acres (28,000 m2) called "Long Acre", and the kitchen garden of Westminster Abbey, which is now the site of "Covent Garden".[1]  He was Lord High Steward for Edward's coronation 20 February 1547. He was created Earl of Bedford on 19 January 1549/1550 for his assistance in carrying out the order of the Council against "images" and for promoting the new religion. In 1552, he was made Lord Lieutenant of Devon.<br />

Idwal ap Cadwaladr (c.650-720; reigned from c.682) (Latin: Ituvellus; English: Judwald), also known as Idwal Iwrch ('Roebuck'), was a king of Gwynedd.<br />
 <br />
Following the death of Idwal's father, Cadwaladr Fendigaid, the history of Gwynedd enters into a somewhat hazy period. His nickname of 'Roebuck' suggests a young man of small stature, and the historical record indicates that he was probably not involved in any major, prolonged conflicts with neighboring kingdoms, focusing instead on the domestic situation of Gwynedd.<br />
 <br />
Nonetheless, it was during the time of Idwal's reign that the nearby kingdom of Mercia to the west was growing in power and influence. Idwal may have been involved in a series of raids on Mercian territory carried out by the neighboring Welsh kingdom of Powys during the reign of the Mercian king Coenred. These raids, if they did indeed occur, and if Gwynedd was indeed involved, seem to have been relatively isolated, and did not result in any sort of more organized conflict.<br />

Robert de Beaumont; allegedly 1st Earl of Leicester of the c1102creation. [Burke's Peerage]<br />
 <br />
------------------------------------<br />
 <br />
On Leicester, Earldom of [Burke's Peerage, p. 1671]:<br />
 <br />
Robert de Beaumont, a companion in arms of William I (The Conqueror) atHastings was granted after the Conquest much land in the Midlands of England, but most of it was in Warwickshire rather than Leicestershire.Indeed his younger brother became Earl of Warwick. Robert also held territory in Normandy and is usually referred to as Count of Meulan. He was a leading political figure in the reigns of William II and Henry Iand on the death of one Ives de Grandmesnil in the First Crusade, the funds for campaigning in which Ives had raised from Robert on the security of his estates, [Robert] came into full possession of them, including a sizeable part of Leicester. The rest of the town was granted him by Henry I and it is possible that he became Earl of Leicester.<br />
 <br />
-------------------------------------<br />
 <br />
EARLDOM OF LEICESTER (I) 1107 ?<br />
 <br />
ROBERT DE BEAUMONT, SEIGNEUR OF BEAUMONT, PONT-AUDEMER, BRIONNE ANDVATTEVILLE in Normandy, and from 1081 COUNT OF MEULAN in the FrenchVexin, son and heir, born circa 1046. When very young he accompanied DukeWilliam to England and distinguished himself at the battle of Hastings,and received large grants of lands in co. Warwick, with smaller holdingsin cos. Leicester, Northants, and Wilts. On 14 July 080, as Robert de Bellomonte, he witnessed the foundation charter of Lessay, and next year he inherited from his mother's family the comté of Meulan. Thereafter he is continuously styled Count (Comes) of Meulan. After the death of the Conqueror he adhered to William Rufus, and was high in favour at his court. He quarrelled with Robert of Normandy about the castellanship of Brionne, in consequence of the exchange of Brionne for Ivry made by hisfather. He was imprisoned, but was released at the intercession of his father Roger, who eventually succeeded in obtaining Brionne in fee. He succeeded to the greater part of his father's lands in Normandy,including Beaumont, Pont-Audemer, Vatteville and Brionne. This paternalinheritance, added to his French comté and his great possessions in cos.Warwick and Leicester, made him one of the most powerful vassals of theCrown. He became one of the chief lay ministers of William Rufus, withwhom he sided against Robert Courtheuse in 1098, and when William invadedthe French Vexin in 1097 he received his troops in his fortresses of thecomté of Meulan. After the death of William Rufus he became one of thechief advisers of Henry I. On the death of Ives de Grandmesnil onCrusade, Robert retained his estates, which Ives had mortgaged to himcirca 1102. Thereby he acquired one-quarter of the town of Leicester, the whole of which was later granted to him by the King. Robert thus added largely to his already vast possessions. In 1104 he was one of the Normanbarons who adhered to Henry on his arrival in Normandy. He was present in the King's army at Tenchebrai, 28 September 1106. In 1110 he was besieged at Meulan by Louis VI, who took the castle by storm, but in the followingyear he retaliated by a raid on Paris, which he plundered. Afterobtaining the whole town of Leicester he is said to have become EARL OFLEICESTER, but, being already Count of Meulan, was never so styled. Thereis no contemporary record that he had the third penny of the pleas of the county, but he doubtless acquired, with the Grandmesnil fief, the thirdpenny of the issues of the Mint at Leicester.<br />
 <br />
He married, in 1096, Isabel, called also Elizabeth, daughter of Hugh DE CREPl, called Hug "le Grand," COUNT OF VERMANDOIS. He died 5 June 1118,and was buried with his ancestors in the chapter house of Préaux (c). His widow married, very shortly after his death, William (DE WARINNE), EARLOF SURREY. [Complete Peerage VII:523-6, (transcribed by Dave Utzinger)]<br />
 <br />
(c) Robert had three sons and five daughters. The sons were Waleran and Robert, twins born in 1104, and Hugh. Waleran, the eldest, succeeded to the Norman and French fiefs, and the English lands held by his grandfather, Roger de Beaumont in 1086. Robert succeeded his father as Earl of Leicester and Hugh is said to have been created Earl of Bedford.The names of only four of the daughter appear to be known--Adeline,Aubreye, Maud and Isabel or Elizabeth. Adeline m. Hugh IV Seigneur of Montfort-sur-Risle. Aubreye m. Hugh II Seigneur of Chateauneuf-en-Thimerais. Maud m. William Louvel, Seigneur of Ivri andBreval. Isabel, also called Elizabeth, was mistress of Henry I, and m.Gilbert de Clare, Earl of Pembroke.<br />

Robert de Beaumont, 1st Earl of Leicester and Count of Meulan (died June 5, 1118) was a powerful English and French nobleman, revered as one of the wisest men of his age. Chroniclers speak highly of his eloquence, his learning, and three kings of England valued his counsel.<br />
 <br />
He was the eldest son of Roger de Beaumont and Adeline of Meulan, and an older brother of Henry de Beaumont, 1st Earl of Warwick. He accompanied William the Conqueror to England in 1066, where his service earned him more than 91 lordships and manors. When his mother died in 1081, Robert inherited the title of Count of Meulan. In 1100 Robert was with William Rufus in the New Forest when the latter died under sudden and violent circumstances. He then pledged alligience to William Rufus' brother, Henry I of England, who created him Earl of Leicester in 1107.<br />
 <br />
In 1096 he married Isabella de Vermandois, daughter of Hugh Magnus and a scion of the French royal family. Their children were:<br />
 <br />
   1. Emma de Beaumont (born 1102)<br />
   2. Waleran IV de Beaumont, Count of Meulan (born 1104)<br />
   3. Robert de Beaumont, 2nd Earl of Leicester (born 1104)<br />
   4. Hugh de Beaumont, Earl of Bedford (born c. 1106)<br />
   5. Adeline de Beaumont, married Hugh IV of Montfort-sur-Risle<br />
   6. Amicia de Beaumont, married Hugh of Château-neuf-Thimerais<br />
   7. Aubrey de Beaumont, married William Lovel<br />
   8. Isabel de Beaumont, a mistress of King Henry I of England and the mother of Strongbow.<br />
 <br />
According to Henry of Huntingdon, Robert died of shame after "a certain earl carried off the lady he had espoused, either by some intrigue or by force and stratagem." His wife Isabella remarried in 1118 to William de Warenne, 2nd Earl of Surrey.<br />

Rhodri ap Idwal (c.690-c.754; reigned from c.720) (Latin: Rodericus; English: Roderick), also known as Rhodri Molwynog ('the Bald and Gray'), was a king of Gwynedd.<br />
 <br />
The son of Idwal Iwrch and his wife, Princess Angrahad of Brittany, comparatively little is known of Rhodri's life or accomplishments. There is even some debate as to when he actually assumed the throne of Gwynedd, with the years 712, 720, 722 or 730 being the most probable candidates. Legend suggests that Rhodri successfully invaded and occupied Dumnonia for a time, before being expelled by the Saxons. This story may indeed be apocryphal, and others have suggested that Rhodri instead have focused on strengthening the island of Anglesey, which, by this time had become the stronghold of the kingdom. This argument is based on the understanding that Æthelbald, king of Mercia and self-styled Bretwalda, was continuing to press the kingdoms of Wales, and that Rhodri would have been far more likely to have been forced to adopt a defensive, rather than offensive, policy in dealing with incursions from Mercia and other Anglo-Saxon principalities.<br />
 <br />
Rhodri married Margaret ferch Duplory, an Irish princess, who bore him a son by the name of Cynan Dindaethwy. Because of the limited reliable information surrounding this period in Welsh history, it is not entirely clear who succeeded Rhodri upon his death, although the most likely candidate seems to be Caradog ap Meirion, a distant cousin, and not his son, who would ascend to the throne only after the death of Caradog.<br />

Cadwallon ap Cadfan (c. 591-633/634) was the King of Gwynedd from around 625 until his death in battle in 633 or 634. The son and successor of Cadfan ap Iago, he is best remembered for devastating Northumbria and defeating and killing its king, Edwin, prior to his own death in battle against Oswald of Bernicia.<br />
 <br />
Cadwallon was initially defeated by Edwin of Northumbria, who invaded Anglesey, and was besieged by the Northumbrians at Priestholm (or Glannauc), a small island off eastern Anglesey. The Annales Cambriae dates this siege to 629. [1] According to Geoffrey of Monmouth's History of the Kings of Britain (which includes a fairly extensive account of Cadwallon's life but is largely legendary-for example, Geoffrey has Cadwallon surviving until after the Battle of Winwaed in 654 or 655), Cadwallon subsequently went to Ireland, and then to the island of Guernsey. From there, according to Geoffrey, Cadwallon led an army into Dumnonia, where he encountered and defeated the Mercians besieging Exeter, and forced their king, Penda, into an alliance. Geoffrey also reports that Cadwallon married a half-sister of Penda. However, his history is, on this as well as all matters, suspect, and it should be treated with caution.<br />
 <br />
In any case, Penda and Cadwallon together made war against the Northumbrians. A battle was fought at Hatfield Chase on October 12, 633 (or 632, according to another interpretation of the chronology), which ended in the defeat and death of Edwin and his son Osfrith. After this, the Kingdom of Northumbria fell into disarray, divided between its sub-kingdoms of Deira and Bernicia, but the war continued: according to the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, "Cadwallon and Penda went and did for the whole land of Northumbria". Bede, in his Ecclesiastical History of the English People, tells us that Cadwallon was besieged by the new king of Deira, Osric, "in a strong town"; Cadwallon, however, "sallied out on a sudden with all his forces, by surprise, and destroyed him [Osric] and all his army." After this, according to Bede, Cadwallon ruled over the "provinces of the Northumbrians" for a year, "not like a victorious king, but like a rapacious and bloody tyrant." Furthermore, Bede tells us that "...Cadwalla [Cadwallon], though he bore the name and professed himself a Christian, was so barbarous in his disposition and behaviour, that he neither spared the female sex, nor the innocent age of children, but with savage cruelty put them to tormenting deaths, ravaging all their country for a long time, and resolving to cut off all the race of the English within the borders of Britain."<br />
 <br />
The king of Bernicia, Eanfrith, was also killed by Cadwallon when the former went to him in an attempt to negotiate peace. However, Cadwallon was defeated by an army under Eanfrith's brother, Oswald, at the Battle of Heavenfield, "though he had most numerous forces, which he boasted nothing could withstand". Cadwallon's soldiers fled after a battle, and he was killed at a place called "Denis's-brook".<br />

Cadwaladr ap Cadwallon (c. 633-682, reigned from c. 655) (Latin: Catuvelladurus; English: Cadwallader), also known as Cadwaladr Fendigaid ('the Blessed') was a king of Gwynedd. Welsh chroniclers consider him to be one the greatest British kings to have ever lived, Geoffrey of Monmouth included him in his Historia Regum Britanniae (vii,3) as the last in the line of legendary Kings of the Britons. His standard, the red dragon, was later adopted by Henry VII of England, founder of the Tudor dynasty , who claimed descent from Cadwaladr.<br />
 <br />
The son of Cadwallon ap Cadfan, Cadwaladr was only a child when his father was killed by the army of Oswald of Bernicia at the Battle of Heavenfield, and Cadfael Cadomedd took over in Gwynedd. Raised abroad, either in Ireland, Brittany or in a neighboring Welsh kingdom, Cadwaladr eventually reclaimed his family's throne from Cadfael, and went on to challenge the West Saxons in Somerset in 658, unsuccessfully. Cadwaladr was arguably the last Welsh ruler to mount a serious counteroffensive against the Anglo-Saxon forces that had overrun England since the fall of the Western Roman Empire. It may be for this reason that Geoffrey of Monmouth chose to end his narrative of British kings with Cadwaladr.<br />
 <br />
After these initial military escapades, Cadwaladr seemingly settled down and focused on the domestic situation, establishing several religious foundations in Gwynedd and gaining a reputation as a devout, pious leader; so much so that, after his death, the Welsh church came to regard him as a saint.<br />
 <br />
According to the Annales Cambriae, he died of plague in 682. Other sources suggest he may have been the victim of an earlier plague, in 663/664, but such an early death would seem to extend the reign of his successor, Idwal to an improbable length.<br />

Louis the Pious (also known as Louis I, Louis the Fair and Louis theDebonaire, German form: Ludwig der Fromme, French form: Louis le Pieux orLouis le Débonnaire, Spanish form: Ludovico Ṕıo) (April 16, 778 - June20, 840) was Emperor and King of the Franks from 814 to 840.<br />
 <br />
Born in Casseuil-sur-Garonne, in today's Gironde, France, the second son of Charlemagne, Louis was crowned king of Aquitaine as a child and sent there with regents and a court to rule in order to quiet rebellions which were forming after Charlemagne's defeat by the Moors in Spain.<br />
 <br />
When Charlemagne's other sons Pepin (810) and Charles (811) died, he was crowned co-emperor with Charlemagne in 813. On his father's death in 814, he inherited the entire Frankish kingdom and all its possessions. He was crowned emperor by Pope Stephen V in Reims in 816. Louis used Benedict of Aniane, a Septimanian Visigothic nobleman and monastic founder to help him reform the Frankish church. One of Benedict's primary reforms was to ensure that all religious houses in Louis' realm adhered to the Rule of St Benedict, named for its creator, Benedict of Nursia (AD 480-550).<br />
 <br />
Like most Frankish men Louis, who was the second son of Charlemagne, expected to share his inheritance with his brothers Charles the Younger and Pepin. However, both of them died before he did - Charles in battle and Pepin subsequent to his blinding and confinement after joining in a revolt against his father - and Louis inherited the Frankish empire intact.<br />
 <br />
Shortly after his accession, he secured his position as emperor in a "moral purge," in which he sent all of his illegitimate half-brothers to monasteries and all of his unmarried sisters to nunneries. In 817, his nephew Bernard, King of Italy, rebelled against his overlordship, and after suppressing the rebellion, he had Bernard blinded and imprisoned. Bernard died the next year. As a deeply religious man, however, Louis wanted to make penance for causing Bernard's death, and did so at Attigny in 822, in front of the nobles of the realm. This act greatly reduced his prestige as a ruler.<br />
 <br />
In 817, Louis laid out plans for an orderly succession by dividing the empire between his three sons from his first marriage with Ermengarde: Lothair (who was crowned king of Italy and co-emperor), Pepin of Aquitaine (king of Aquitaine) and Louis (king of Bavaria). After Ermengarde's death, he remarried with Judith of Bavaria and had a fourth son, Charles, in 823. Louis' attempts to add Charles to his will met with the stiff resistance of his older sons, and the last decade of his reign was marked by civil war. In 829, he stripped Lothair of his position of co-emperor and banished him to Italy. In 830, the three brothers invaded their father's lands, forcing him to abdicate in favor of Lothar. Louis the Pious returned to power the next year and stripped Lothar not only of imperial title, but also of the kingdom of Italy, which he bestowed on Charles. Pepin revolted, followed by Louis the German in 832, and Lothar, with the support of Pope Gregory IV, joined the revolt in 833. The brothers defeated their father and imprisoned him along with Charles. Judith was sent to a nunnery, while Pepin and Louis the German both annexed formerly imperial lands. In 835, however, the family made peace and restored Louis to the imperial throne.<br />
 <br />
When Pepin died in 838, Louis the Pious declared Charles the new king of Aquitaine. The nobles, however, elected Pepin's son Pepin II. When Louis died in 840, the dispute plunged the brothers into a civil war that was only settled in 843 by the Treaty of Verdun (843) which split the Frankish realm into three parts, the kernels of later France and Germany. The dispute over the kingship of Aquitaine was not fully settled until 860.<br />
