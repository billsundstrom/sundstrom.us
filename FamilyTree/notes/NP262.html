Attilla the HUN

Mundzuk, Prince Of The Huns,  377 in Romania<br>

Uldin,       King Of The Huns,     335 north of the Black Sea<br>

<br>
From Wikipedia<br>
<br>
Attila the Hun (Old Norse: Atle, Atli; German: Etzel; c. 406-453) was the last and most powerful king of the European Huns. He reigned over what was then Europe's largest empire, from 434 until his death. His empire stretched from Central Europe to the Black Sea and from the Danube River to the Baltic. During his rule he was among the direst enemies of the Eastern and Western Roman Empires: he invaded the Balkans twice and encircled Constantinople in the second invasion. He marched through France as far as Orleans before being turned back at Chalons; and he drove the western emperor Valentinian III from his capital at Ravenna in 452.<br>
<br>
Though his empire died with him, and he left no remarkable legacy, he has become a legendary figure in the history of Europe. In much of Western Europe, he is remembered as the epitome of cruelty and rapacity. Some histories lionise him as a great and noble king, and he plays major roles in three Norse sagas.<br>
<br>
The European Huns seem to have been a western extension of the Xiongnu (Xiongnú), a group of proto-Mongolian or proto-Turkic nomad tribes from north-eastern China and Central Asia. These people achieved military superiority over their rivals (most of them highly cultured and civilized) by their splendid state of readiness for combat, amazing mobility, and weapons like the Hun bow.<br>
<br>
Attila was born around 406. Nothing is known about his childhood; the supposition that at a young age he was already a capable leader and a capable warrior is reasonable but unknowable.<br>
<br>
By 432, the Huns were united under Rua. In 434 Rua died, leaving his nephews Attila and Bleda, the sons of his brother Mundzuk, in control over all the united Hun tribes. At the time of their accession, the Huns were bargaining with Theodosius II's envoys over the return of several renegade tribes who had taken refuge within the Byzantine Empire. The following year, Attila and Bleda met with the imperial legation at Margus (present-day Pozarevac) and, all seated on horseback in the Hunnic manner, negotiated a successful treaty: the Romans agreed not only to return the fugitive tribes (who had been a welcome aid against the Vandals), but also to double their previous tribute of 350 Roman pounds (c. 114.5 kg) of gold, open their markets to Hunnish traders, and pay a ransom of eight solidi for each Roman taken prisoner by the Huns. The Huns, satisfied with the treaty, decamped from the empire and departed into the interior of the continent, perhaps to consolidate and strengthen their empire. Theodosius used this opportunity to strengthen the walls of Constantinople, building the city's first sea wall, and to build up his border defenses along the Danube.<br>
<br>
The Huns remained out of Roman sight for the next five years. During this time, they were conducting an invasion of Persia. However, in Armenia, a Persian counterattack resulted in a defeat for Attila and Bleda, and they ceased their efforts to conquer Persia. In 440, they reappeared on the borders of the empire, attacking the merchants at the market on the north bank of the Danube that had been arranged for by the treaty. Attila and Bleda threatened further war, claiming that the Romans had failed to fulfil their treaty obligations and that the bishop of Margus (not far from modern Belgrade) had crossed the Danube to ransack and desecrate the royal Hun graves on the Danube's north bank. They crossed the Danube and laid waste Illyrian cities and forts on the river, among them, according to Priscus, Viminacium, which was a city of the Moesians in Illyria. Their advance began at Margus, for when the Romans discussed handing over the offending bishop, he slipped away secretly to the barbarians and betrayed the city to them.<br>
<br>
Theodosius had stripped the river's defenses in response to the Vandal Geiseric's capture of Carthage in 440 and the Sassanid Yazdegerd II's invasion of Armenia in 441. This left Attila and Bleda a clear path through Illyria into the Balkans, which they invaded in 441. The Hunnish army, having sacked Margus and Viminacium, took Sigindunum (modern Belgrade) and Sirmium before halting its operations. A lull followed during 442, when Theodosius recalled his troops from North Africa and ordered a large new issue of coins to finance operations against the Huns. Having made these preparations, he thought it safe to refuse the Hunnish kings' demands.<br>
<br>
Attila and Bleda responded by renewing their campaign in 443. Striking along the Danube, they overran the military centers of Ratiara and successfully besieged Naissus (modern Nis) with battering rams and rolling towers-military sophistication that was new in the Hun repertory-then pushing along the Nisava they took Serdica (Sofia), Philippopolis (Plovdiv), and Arcadiopolis. They encountered and destroyed the Roman force outside Constantinople and were only halted by their lack of siege equipment capable of breaching the city's massive walls. Theodosius admitted defeat and sent the court official Anatolius to negotiate peace terms, which were harsher than the previous treaty: the Emperor agreed to hand over 6,000 Roman pounds (c. 1963 kg) of gold as punishment for having disobeyed the terms of the treaty during the invasion; the yearly tribute was tripled, rising to 2,100 Roman pounds (c. 687 kg) in gold; and the ransom for each Roman prisoner rose to 12 solidi.<br>
<br>
Their desires contented for a time, the Hun kings withdrew into the interior of their empire. According to Jordanes (following Priscus), sometime during the peace following the Huns' withdrawal from Byzantium (probably around 445), Bleda died, and Attila took the throne for himself. There is much historical speculation whether Attila murdered his brother, or whether Bleda died for another reason. In any case, Attila was now undisputed lord of the Huns, and again turned towards the eastern Empire.<br>
<br>
Sole ruler<br>
Constantinople suffered major natural (and man-made) disasters in the years following the Huns' departure: bloody riots between the racing factions of the Hippodrome; plagues in 445 and 446, the second following a famine; and a four-month series of earthquakes which levelled much of the city wall and killed thousands, causing another epidemic. This last struck in 447, just as Attila, having consolidated his power, again rode south into the empire through Moesia. The Roman army, under the Gothic magister militum Arnegisclus, met him on the river Vid and was defeated-though not without inflicting heavy losses. The Huns were left unopposed and rampaged through the Balkans as far as Thermopylae; Constantinople itself was saved by the intervention of the prefect Flavius Constantinus, who organized the citizenry to reconstruct the earthquake-damaged walls (and in some places, to construct a new line of fortification in front of the old). An account of this invasion survives:<br>
<br>
    The barbarian nation of the Huns, which was in Thrace, became so great that more than a hundred cities were captured and Constantinople almost came into danger and most men fled from it. . . . And there were so many murders and blood-lettings that the dead could not be numbered. Ay, for they took captive the churches and monasteries and slew the monks and maidens in great numbers.<br>
<br>
        - Callinicus, in his Life of Saint Hypatius<br>
<br>
Attila demanded, as a condition of peace, that the Romans should continue paying tribute in gold-and evacuate a strip of land stretching three hundred miles east from Sigindunum (Belgrade) and up to a hundred miles south of the Danube. Negotiations continued between Roman and Hun for approximately three years. The historian Priscus was sent as emissary to Attila's encampment in 448, and the fragments of his reports preserved by Jordanes offer the best glimpse of Attila among his numerous wives, his Scythian fool, and his Moorish dwarf, impassive and unadorned amid the splendor of the courtiers:<br>
<br>
    A luxurious meal, served on silver plate, had been made ready for us and the barbarian guests, but Attila ate nothing but meat on a wooden trencher. In everything else, too, he showed himself temperate; his cup was of wood, while to the guests were given goblets of gold and silver. His dress, too, was quite simple, affecting only to be clean. The sword he carried at his side, the latchets of his Scythian shoes, the bridle of his horse were not adorned, like those of the other Scythians, with gold or gems or anything costly.<br>
<br>
"The floor of the room was covered with woollen mats for walking on," Priscus noted.<br>
<br>
During these three years, according to a legend recounted by Jordanes, Attila discovered the "Sword of Mars":<br>
<br>
    The historian Priscus says it was discovered under the following circumstances: "When a certain shepherd beheld one heifer of his flock limping and could find no cause for this wound, he anxiously followed the trail of blood and at length came to a sword it had unwittingly trampled while nibbling the grass. He dug it up and took it straight to Attila. He rejoiced at this gift and, being ambitious, thought he had been appointed ruler of the whole world, and that through the sword of Mars supremacy in all wars was assured to him.<br>
<br>
        - Jordanes, The Origin and Deeds of the Goths ch. XXXV (e-text)<br>
<br>
Later scholarship would identify this legend as part of a pattern of sword worship common among the nomads of the Central Asian steppes.<br>
<br>
Attila in the west<br>
As late as 450, Attila had proclaimed his intent to attack the powerful Visigoth kingdom of Toulouse in alliance with Emperor Valentinian III. He had previously been on good terms with the western Empire and its de facto ruler Flavius Aetius-Aetius had spent a brief exile among the Huns in 433, and the troops Attila provided against the Goths and Bagaudae had helped earn him the largely honorary title of magister militum in the west. The gifts and diplomatic efforts of Geiseric, who opposed and feared the Visigoths, may also have influenced Attila's plans.<br>
<br>
However Valentinian's sister Honoria, in order to escape her forced betrothal to a senator, had sent the Hunnish king a plea for help-and her ring-in the spring of 450. Though Honoria may not have intended a proposal of marriage, Attila chose to interpret her message as such; he accepted, asking for half of the western Empire as dowry. When Valentinian discovered the plan, only the influence of his mother Galla Placidia convinced him to exile, rather than kill, Honoria; he also wrote to Attila strenuously denying the legitimacy of the supposed marriage proposal. Attila, not convinced, sent an embassy to Ravenna to proclaim that Honoria was innocent, that the proposal had been legitimate, and that he would come to claim what was rightfully his.<br>
<br>
Meanwhile, Theodosius having died in a riding accident, his successor Marcian cut off the Huns' tribute in late 450; and multiple invasions, by the Huns and by others, had left the Balkans with little to plunder. The king of the Salian Franks had died, and the succession struggle between his two sons drove a rift between Attila and Aetius: Attila supported the elder son, while Aetius supported the younger. J.B. Bury believes that Attila's intent, by the time he marched west, was to extend his kingdom-already the strongest on the continent-across Gaul to the Atlantic shore. By the time Attila had gathered his vassals-Gepids, Ostrogoths, Rugians, Scirians, Heruls, Thuringians, Alans, Burgundians, et al.-and begun his march west, he had declared intent of alliance both with the Visigoths and with the Romans.<br>
<br>
In 451, his arrival in Belgica with an army said by Jordanes to be half a million strong soon made his intent clear. On April 7 he captured Metz, and Aetius moved to oppose him, gathering troops from among the Franks, the Burgundians, and the Celts. A mission by Avitus, and Attila's continued westward advance, convinced the Visigoth king Theodoric I (Theodorid) to ally with the Romans. The combined armies reached Orleans ahead of Attila, thus checking and turning back the Hunnish advance. Aetius gave chase and caught the Huns at a place usually assumed to be near Châlons-en-Champagne. The two armies clashed in the Battle of Chalons, which ended with a victory for the Gothic-Roman alliance, though Theodoric was killed in the fighting. Attila withdrew beyond the border, and the alliance quickly disbanded.<br>
<br>
Invasion of Italy and death<br>
Attila returned in 452 to claim his marriage to Honoria anew, invading and ravaging Italy along the way; his army sacked numerous cities and razed Aquileia completely, leaving no trace of it behind. Valentinian fled from Ravenna to Rome; Aetius remained in the field but lacked the strength to offer battle. Attila finally halted at the Po, where he met an embassy including the prefect Trigetius, the consul Aviennus, and Pope Leo I. After the meeting he turned his army back, having claimed neither Honoria's hand nor the territories he desired.<br>

<br>
Several explanations for his actions have been proffered. The plague and famine which coincided with his invasion may have caused his army to weaken, or the troops that Marcian sent across the Danube may have given him reason to retreat, or perhaps both. Priscus reports that superstitious fear of the fate of Alaric-who died shortly after sacking Rome in 410-gave the Hun pause. Prosper of Aquitaine's pious "fable which has been represented by the pencil of Raphael and the chisel of Algardi" (as Gibbon called it) says that the Pope, aided by Saint Peter and Saint Paul, convinced him to turn away from the city. Various historians (e.g. Isaac Asimov) have supposed that the embassy brought a large amount of gold to the Hunnish leader and persuaded him to abandon his campaign.<br>
<br>
Whatever his reasons, Attila left Italy and returned to his palace across the Danube. From there he planned to strike at Constantinople again and reclaim the tribute which Marcian had cut off. However, he died in the early months of 453; the conventional account, from Priscus, says that on the night after a feast celebrating his latest marriage (to a Goth named Ildico), he suffered a severe nosebleed and choked to death. His warriors, upon discovering his death, mourned him by cutting off their hair and gashing themselves with their swords so that, says Jordanes, "the greatest of all warriors should be mourned with no feminine lamentations and with no tears, but with the blood of men." He was buried in a triple coffin-of gold, silver, and iron-with the spoils of his conquest, and his funeral party was killed to keep his burial place secret. After his death, he lived on as a legendary figure: the characters of Etzel in the Nibelungenlied and Atli in both the Volsunga saga and the Poetic Edda were both loosely based on his life.<br>
<br>
(An alternate story of his death, first recorded eighty years after the fact by the Roman chronicler Count Marcellinus, reports: "Attila rex Hunnorum Europae orbator provinciae noctu mulieris manu cultroque confoditur." ("Attila, King of the Huns and ravager of the provinces of Europe, was pierced by the hand and blade of his wife.") The Volsunga saga and the Poetic Edda claim that King Atli died at the hands of his wife Gudrun. Most scholars reject these accounts as no more than romantic fables, preferring instead the version given by Attila's contemporary Priscus.)<br>
<br>
His sons Ellak (his appointed successor), Dengizik, and Ernakh fought over his legacy and, divided, were defeated and scattered the following year in the Battle of Nedao by the Gepids and Ostrogoths. Attila's empire did not outlast him.<br>

Pippin the HUNCHBACK
<p>
<a name ="I015153"><b>[I015153]</b></a><br />
Pippin the Hunchback (b. before 770, d. 813) was the first son of Charles the Great (Charlemagne) and his first wife (or concubine) Himiltrude. Accounts describe Pippin as normally proportioned with attractive features. However, his looks were marred by a spinal deformity from which his nickname is derived.<br>
<br>
Due to his disability, Pippin was never a strong contender to succeed his father to the Frankish throne. Nevertheless, Charles treated his son well, giving him precedence over his younger brothers as was appropriate for his age. Pippin was an amiable fellow, and he grew to be a well-liked member of Charles' court. The hunchbacked prince probably held some hope for succession from his father. In addition, Pippin was an easy target for discontented nobles, who lavished sympathies on him and lamented the treatment his mother had received when Charles had divorced her in favor of a Lombard princess. Thus, in 780, Charles formally disinherited Pippin and had the pope baptize his third son, Carloman, as Pippin. This move may have been prompted by Charles' third wife and the mother of Carloman, Hildegarde. The hunchbacked prince was a threat to her sons' succession, both due to Charles' doting attitude toward him and his name (Frankish succession had alternated between Charleses and Pippins for the last four generations).<br>
<br>
Pippin was allowed to remain at court, and Charles continued to give the boy precedence over his younger brothers. Pippin also remained a popular "friend" of discontented nobles, and in 792, several counts played upon Pippin's dislike for his brothers to convince the deformed prince to play the figurehead in their rebellion. The conspirators planned to kill Charles, his wife Hildegarde, and his three sons by her. Pippin the Hunchback would then be set upon the throne as a more sympathetic (and more easily manipulated) king. The day of the assassination, Pippin pretended to be ill in order to meet with the plotters. The scheme nearly succeeded, but a Lombard deacon named Fardulf ultimately exposed it.<br>
<br>
King Charles held an assembly at Regensburg to try the conspirators, and all were found guilty of high treason and ordered executed. Charles seems still to have held fond feelings for his first son, however, for Pippin's sentence was commuted. Instead, Pippin was forced to enter the monastery of Prüm to live out the rest of his life as a monk. Pippin died there some twenty years later.<br>

Almos of HUNGARY
<p>
<a name ="I008442"><b>[I008442]</b></a><br />
Álmos (in Croatian and Slovak Almoš) (died 1129) was a Hungarian prince, the son of King Geza I of Hungary, brother of King Kálmán. He held several governmental posts in the Kingdom of Hungary.<br>
<br>
Between 1084 and 1091 he was the duke of Slavonia; between 1091 and 1095 he was named King of Slavonia (eastern Croatia). In 1095 Kálmán dethroned Álmos, making him the duke of the apanage Nitrian duchy (Tercia pars regni) instead.<br>
<br>
Álmos, supported by Germany and Bohemia, came in conflict with Kálmán in 1098, after Kálmán had declared himself the king of the whole of Croatia in 1097 (crowned in 1102). On August 21, 1104 Álmos married Predslava, the daughter of Svyatopolk II of Kiev.<br>
<br>
Kálmán made peace with Álmos in 1108, but only to have Álmos and his son Béla imprisoned in 1108 or 1109 and then blinded to prevent them from becoming the future king. Álmos died in captivity, but his son would succeed as king of Hungary.<br>
<br>
Álmos was the last duke of Nitra (in Hungarian Nyitra), his removal also marks the end of the Nitrian Frontier Duchy and thus a full integration of the territory of Slovakia into Hungary.<br>

Almos of HUNGARY
<p>
<a name ="I007834"><b>[I007834]</b></a><br />
From Wikipedia<br>
<br>
High Prince (fejedelem) Álmos was the legendary father of Árpád, the founder of the Hungarian state. He was probably born around 820, and was leader of the Hungarian tribes from 858 till his death in 895 or 896. His mother was Emese; his father was Ogyek, both of Dentumogeria, Central Asia.<br>
<br>
The legends say that "his mother Emese had seen a divine dream of a Turul bird that flew over her and got her with child; she saw her womb as the source of many great kings, but they would multiply in foreign lands". This is given as the explanation for the name Álmos (ie, "The Dreamt One"). Although this may seem unusual compared to Christian stories, it justified the divine origins of the Hungarian leaders.<br>
<br>
He strengthened the alliance between the tribal leaders, and he probably led the movement to secede from the Khazar empire. He successfully kept his son Árpád in power, contrary to tribal practices. The raids were widespread, and the tribes successfully settled in Etelköz, where they were able to fight back the Besenyo" (Pecheneg) attacks, becoming stronger by them.<br>
<br>
His death, according to the legends prophesied by a warning that "he is going to found a great line of emperors, but he must not enter the land of Pannonia", was probably caused by either assassination or human sacrifice. Unfortunately, we do not have enough information on tribal beliefs to explain the real significance of the prophetic legend.<br>
<br>
Note that the two legends concerning Álmos' conception and death are reported to us by 13th century (already Christian) scholars in medieval codices, who lived 400 years after the actual life of Álmos, and that both legends show very strong parallels to Christian stories from the Bible. It is possible that, for Álmos' birth, the authors borrowed elements of Mary's conception by the Holy Spirit; and for his death, of Moses' not being allowed to enter Canaan after leading Israel to the Holy Land.<br>

Andrew I of HUNGARY
<p>
<a name ="I007746"><b>[I007746]</b></a><br />
He restored the Árpád dynasty after the Vartha Pagan Revolt, and in the process of suppressing paganism executed his own brother Levente.<br>
<br>
Between 1049 and 1052 he fought off three invasions by the German King Henry III.<br>

Andrew II of HUNGARY
<p>
<a name ="I008426"><b>[I008426]</b></a><br />
From Wikipedia<br>
<br>
Andrew II (1175-1235) (Hungarian: II. András or II. Endre, Slovak: Ondrej II) was a son of Bela III of Hungary and succeeded his nephew, the infant Ladislaus III, in 1205.<br>
<br>
No other king of Hungary, perhaps, was so mischievous to his country. Valiant, enterprising, pious as he was, all these fine qualities were ruined by a reckless good nature which never thought of the morrow. He declares in one of his decrees that the generosity of a king should be limitless, and he acted up to this principle throughout his reign. He gave away everything, money, villages, domains, whole counties, to the utter impoverishment of the treasury, thereby rendering the crown, for the first time in Hungarian history, dependent upon the great feudatories, who, in Hungary as elsewhere, took all they could get and gave as little as possible in return. In all matters of government, Andrew was equally reckless and haphazard. He is directly responsible for the beginnings of the feudal anarchy which well-nigh led to the extinction of the monarchy at the end of the 13th century. The great feudatories did not even respect the lives of the royal family, for Andrew was recalled from a futile attempt to reconquer Galicia (which really lay beyond the Hungarian sphere of influence), through the murder of his first wife Gertrude of Meran (1185 - September 24, 1213), by rebellious nobles jealous of the influence of her relatives.<br>
<br>
In 1215 he married Iolanthe (Yolande) of France, but in 1217 was compelled by the pope to lead the Fifth Crusade to the Holy Land, which he undertook in hopes of being elected Latin emperor of Constantinople. The crusade excited no enthusiasm in Hungary, but Andrew contrived to collect 15,000 men together, whom he led to Venice; whence, not without much haggling and the surrender of all the Hungarian claims upon Zara, about two-thirds of them were conveyed to Acre. Nevertheless the whole expedition was a forlorn hope. The Christian kingdom of Palestine was by this time reduced to a strip of coast about 440 sq. m. in extent, and after a drawn battle with the Turks on the Jordan (November 10), and fruitless assaults on the fortresses of the Lebanon and on Mount Tabor, Andrew started home (January 18, 1218) through Antioch, Iconium, Constantinople and Bulgaria. On his return he found the feudal barons in the ascendant, and they extorted from him the Golden Bull.<br>
<br>
Andrew's last exploit was to defeat an invasion of Frederick of Austria in 1234. The same year he married his third wife, Beatrice of Este.<br>
<br>
Family<br>
Andrew had five children by his first wife, Gertrude:<br>
   1. Maria of Hungary (1203-1221), married Tsar Ivan Asen II of Bulgaria<br>
   2. Bela IV of Hungary (1206-1270)<br>
   3. Saint Elizabeth of Hungary (1207-1231)<br>
   4. Kálmán, Duke of Croatia (1208-1241)<br>
   5. András, King of Halicz (1210-1234)<br>
<br>
From his second marriage to Yolande de Courtney, he had one daughter:<br>
   1. Jolán (Yolande) of Hungary (1215-1251), married James I of Aragon<br>
<br>
Andrew's third marriage to Beatrice d'Este produced one posthumous son:<br>
   1. István (1236-1271), who was himself father of King Andrew III of Hungary<br>

Arpad of HUNGARY
<p>
<a name ="I007833"><b>[I007833]</b></a><br />
From Wikipedia<br>
<br>
Árpád (c.850-907) was the probable leader of the main proto-Magyar tribe, and the founder of the Arpad dynasty. Árpád was the son of Álmos.<br>
<br>
According to (not very reliable) medieval chronicles, seven proto-Magyar tribes elected him - as the leader of one of those tribes - their common leader in Etelköz around 890. He is said to have been the leader ("prince" - fejedelem) of the proto-Magyars for 20 years and to have died in 907. The Byzantine De administrando imperio says around 950: Prior to this Árpád, the Magyars did never have another ruling prince ('archont') and since then up to today the ruling prince of Hungary has been from that family. Other sources however imply that there was a second ruling prince called Kursan, who was either at the same "level" with Árpád, or a kind of "vice-prince". Based on Arabic sources, Árpád's title seems to have been kende, although some scholars consider Kende to be the name of a person.<br>
<br>
After several looting raids in Europe (from the 860s onwards), the proto-Magyars in Etelköz under Árpád, pushed by the Pechenegs from the East, decided to definitively pass the Carpathian Mountains. In 896 they occupied the Upper Tisza river, from there they undertook numerous looting raids in central and western Europe, and in 900/901 they moved to Pannonia. The proto-Magyars entering the Pannonian fields in 896 represented about 200,000 - 250,000 people.<br>
<br>
According to De administrando imperio, his children included (maybe not exclusively) :<br>
   1. Tarhos (Tarkacsu)<br>
   2. Üllo" (Jeleg)<br>
   3. Jutas (Jutocsa)<br>
   4. Zolta (Zaltasz) - the youngest one.<br>
<br>
According to legends, Árpád is also said to have been holding the first "parliamentary" session with 40 other "nobles" on horseback before 900 AD.<br>
