John WEBSTER
<p>
<a name ="I006999"><b>[I006999]</b></a><br />
Offices:<br>
Assistant, General Court of the Colony of Connecticut, 1639-1655<br>
Commissioner to the United Colonies of New England, 1654<br>
Deputy Governor, Colony of Connecticut 1655<br>
Governor, Colony of Connecticut, 1656<br>
Chief Magistrate, Colony of Connecticut, 1657<br>
Magistrate, Hadley, Massachusetts, 1660<br>
<br>
John Webster was born on August 16, 1590 in Cossington, Leicestershire, England to Matthew and Elizabeth (Ashton) Webster. His was a family of some substance. On November 7, 1609, he and Agnes Smith were married at Cossington. They had five children by the time they immigrated to New England, and had two more after they arrived.<br>
<br>
John Webster and his family settled in Watertown, Massachusetts in the early 1630s and moved to Hartford in 1636, probably with Thomas Hooker's group, which left Newtown, Massachusetts in April 1636. He was one of the original landholders of Hartford, was a member of the committee that sat with the Court of Magistrates of the Colony of Connecticut in 1637 and 1638, and became an Assistant to the General Court of the Colony of Connecticut in 1639. As an Assistant, he was one of a small group of men who were second in power only to the Governor, Deputy Governor, and General Court of Magistrates. He traveled to towns in Connecticut as a judge, helped create criminal laws for the colony, settled land and boundary disputes, helped the New England Congress supply Connecticut towns with soldiers and ammunition for an expedition against the Indians, and surveyed the highway from Hartford to Windsor. He was a Commissioner to the United Colonies of New England in 1654.<br>
<br>
The Colony of Connecticut elected him as Deputy Governor in 1655, with Thomas Welles as Governor. The next year, 1656, John Webster was elected as Governor. Elections were annual, and prior to 1659 it was believed that no person should serve a term of more than one year. In 1657 John Winthrop was elected as governor, with Thomas Welles as Deputy Governor and John Webster as Chief Magistrate.<br>
<br>
John Webster was one of the leading members of the First congregational Church of Hartford, whose minister, the Rev. Thomas Hooker, was the dynamic leader of the first settlers that came to Hartford. When Hooker died in 1647, a controversy arose as to who should become his successor. The Rev. Samuel Stone, Hooker's assistant, was supported by a majority of the church members. However, Rev. Stone wanted to change some aspects of church procedures, including liberalizing the eligibility requirements for infant baptism and admission to communion, while limiting the autonomy of each congregation. A significant number of the parishioners disagreed with Stone and wanted Michael Wigglesworth as Rev. Hooker's successor. A religious dispute arose, and the congregation became split. Church and state were not separate at that time, so this became a political as well as a spiritual crisis for Hartford.<br>
<br>
The dissenting group, of which John Webster was a prominent member, wanted to withdraw from the Hartford church and move to Massachusetts, but Rev. Stone and his followers would not release them from their church covenant. The dissenters attempted to get other Congregational Churches in nearby towns to accept them, but none would. The principles disputed in Hartford were introduced in the General Assembly as the Half-Way Covenant in August 1657 and became points of conflict for Congregational Churches throughout New England for over a decade. A key provision allowed Congregational churches to baptize children of parents who had themselves been baptized but who had never professed conversion and had consequently never been fully admitted to the Church. The Half-Way Covenant was approved by a New England church synod in 1662 and finally passed by the Connecticut legislature in May 1669. On February 12, 1669/70 some members of the First Church of Hartford left to form the Second Church.<br>
<br>
Meanwhile, on April 18, 1659, through the arbitration of some Massachusetts Congregational Church leaders, many of the initial dissenters and Rev. Stone's faction signed an agreement for the former group to move to Massachusetts. The Hadley Company, as it was known, left Hartford shortly after that, with John Webster as one of its leaders. He was given the responsibility of laying out the roads for the company. He and his family went first to Northampton, Massachusetts, and later to Hadley, where he was made a magistrate in May 1660. He died there, of a fever, on April 5, 1661 and is buried in Hadley. His wife Agnes died in Hartford in 1667. His most famous descendant was Noah Webster, who was born in Hartford in 1758 and who died May 28, 1843, in New Haven.<br>
<br>
John Webster's home lot in Hartford, Connecticut was on the east side of what became Governor Street (the present Popieluszko Court).<br>

"CONGRATULATED ON 84TH BIRTHDAY<br>
Mrs. E.W. Knowlton of Cambridge Station recently celebrated her eight-fourth birthday by attending the seventieth anniversary of the founding of the Little White Church at Cambridge Station.<br>
She was born and married in the same house, built by her grandfather's hands - and her father, John Webster, was beloved by all for miles around. She spent her life in Cambridge, with the exception of spending the winters with her daughter, Mrs. (Dr.) Skinner, of Mahone Bay, since the death of her husband in October, 1934. Just before his death they celebrated their "golden wedding" by having 74 callers in the afternoon, and 21 in evening, when Mr. Knowlton bravely sat with her under an arch of lilacs and apple blossoms (the same kind of flowers the arch was made from at the time of their marriage).<br>
Through any trial and suffering she has always shown an unfaltering faith in her God, and in mankind.<br>
When her sons were overseas in the last war Mrs. Knowlton never heard the telephone ring but she thought "My boy has gone." And when her husband saw anyone running towards the mill he always thought "The lad's been killed." Incidentally they had the first telephone to be installed in Cambridge.<br>
She has loved her family with a true devotion, and yet found the time to crochet little gifts for folks for miles around every Christmas or birthday. Her own birthday is a sacred day for her, and she loves to be home among her own dear neighbors who have loved her down through the years and have found many kindly ways of showing that love.<br>
One day an old man came in to use the telephone - he had never seen one before - and when the voice he knew answered him at the other end he turned to Mrs. Knowlton and said "Why I hear him - I hear him."<br>
Mrs. Knowlton has been treasurer of the Ladies' Aid since its inception in 1913, only relinquishing her duties, pro tem, while she is with her daughter winters.<br>
Folks for miles around lovingly call her "Aunt Min," and all wish her many more years of useful activity and cheery ways among us."<br>
