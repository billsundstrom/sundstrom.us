Wallace Anderson: Part I<br>
by The Bagpipe Staff on February 2, 2005<br>
By Laura Kaufmann<br>
<br>
A young boy watched as his father removed the "whites only" sign from above his storeʼs drinking fountain, telling his son that it just wasnʼt right. The boy would learn that to be an agent of change, one must take initiative; and, often, do it alone.<br>
For the past three years, Wallace Roy Anderson II, the vice president of admissions and enrollment, has been changing Covenant College from a desk in an office across the hall from the financial aid office. Nearly everyone has heard of him, and even a few recognize his cheerful greeting. But not many know him.<br>
Anderson entered the world 55 years ago in the nucleus of the Deep South. His father co-owned two grocery stores and a variety store in Savannah, Georgia, offering the family a comfortable middle class life, including a three bedroom house and a swimming pool in the backyard. It was, according to Anderson, an "average Baptist home," where he and his sister Cathie, three years his elder, were raised.<br>
Anderson attended public school in the primary grades, transferred to a Christian school for a few years, and then finished his education at a public high school. Though he seemed to be doing well, Anderson was troubled.<br>
"I was a difficult child," he said. "My mother has often said that if they had known what ADD [Attention Deficit Disorder] was back then she would have bought the Ritalin company." Because of his short attention span, Anderson rarely listened to music, and hemophilia-B prevented him from playing most sports.<br>
"He was kind of a loner," said his wife of 15 years, Paige.<br>
Anderson got a taste of his future in the Reformed camp when the Covenant College choir performed in Savannah. His aunt, Geane Baker, was deeply moved and suggested Covenant to his sister Cathie. The next year, Cathie decided to attend and became a Christian here in the early 1960ʼs.<br>
"I heard her testimony not too long ago," said Anderson. "She really understood Reformed theology from Collyn Schmidt, who taught her one summer that cleaning toilets was for the glory of God. She said she thought that was the strangest thing she had ever heard, but Collyn kept explaining it until she understood."<br>
When Anderson graduated from high school, he enrolled at Georgetown, a Baptist college in Kentucky, for two semesters. But his sisterʼs experience at Covenant inspired his parents to send him here.<br>
"I credit the seeds that were planted here even though I was on the fringes constantly," he said. "I wanted to be like everybody here, even though I knew I wasnʼt. I longed for what they had."<br>
Yet as a non-believer, Anderson separated himself from the community, spending time on extra-curricular activities. He took a job as a chauffeur for the head of the Republican National Committee Harry Carbaugh. He also sat with an elderly man in Chattanooga and stayed with him at night to care for him.<br>
Anderson studied music here for two and a half semesters, struggling to meet academic standards. Former music professor John Hamm and his wife Esther mentored him during that period.<br>
"Every Saturday in high school, for 16 weeks in a row, he went to the theatre and watched The Sound of Music," Mrs. Anderson said. "Thatʼs when he fell in love with music."<br>
Anderson confirmed that passion. "It softened me up a bit," he said. "And I needed softening."<br>
He first encountered Francis Schaeffer at Covenant. "Part of the reason I hated Covenant was that I had to listen to a man in knickers," he said. He did not perceive then that many years down the road Schaefferʼs works would change his life.<br>
Arline Wetzel (now Cadwell) knew Anderson from working in student development.<br>
"We just knew all the students," Cadwell said. She recalled that Anderson endeared himself to many people and exuded self-confidence. One of his goals was to get Cadwell to develop a deep appreciation for music.<br>
"He was very contagious about music," she said. "There always seemed to be a lot of action going on around him."<br>
Even so, Cadwell was one of few people who knew him closely, and disconnectedness from the Covenant community, among other things, perpetuated his proclivity for rule-breaking. He left midway through his third semester and finished his undergraduate degree in music at Statesboro University in Georgia.<br>
Though she lost touch with Anderson after college, Cadwell recognizes the difference the years have made. "I marvel at the way God has worked in his life since those days," she said.<br>

The district clerk service was held in the first part and mid-17th century in the northern contract in the current county of Norrbotten by Lars Andersson, Gäddvik no. 2, Luleå parish. Lars Andersson's year of birth and death are unknown. He was married to "Captain Magdalena 8malin) Hansdotter Stark" in which we can guess that we have a daughter of the famous sheriff his Joensson, who also probably lived at Gäddvik no. 2. in the 1657 court book for Luleå parish tells that the summer parliament on June 9, 1657 "Nils Christophersson in Antnäs complained to lars Andersson in Gäddvik, that he pledged to a Nyköpingsbo a" Camlotz kiortell and a flowered Sametztryja something worn and a Russian sheet ", all together for 22 daler. Some time later Lars Andersson had came to bemälte nyköpingsbo and "uthan command redeemed bemälte clothes, which were still gone for Nils Christophersson. The court now decided that Lars Andersson should give Nils 30 daler copper coins. In 1653 Lars Andersson bought from the church 1 stop wine for 2 daler. In 1663 he gave 8 daler copper coins for "church room" and in 1664 he paid 6 daler for a pig - in - law's father - in - law. for the governor Johan Graan presented the common people's complaint about the heavy tongue, which the so-called wastelands of the butter tithe constituted for them. probably due to this, the governor reminded in December, so the parish priest in Luleå parish Hans Anthelius, a priest who more than once, gave rise to complaints that he was not allowed to take the wasteland from anyone but those who had 6 cows and above. The common people also complained that they had to give tithes of the cows, which did not receive + all year. The pastor should, as befits a servant of the Lord, "not the condition of the poor by the command of God." District clerk in Gäddvik 2.

 ANGELTHEOW
<p>
<a name ="I005595"><b>[I005595]</b></a><br />
Angeltheow, also spelled Angletheow, Engengenthe, or Angenwit (? - c. 477) was the great-great-great-grandfather of Creoda of Mercia and the son of the first Offa of Mercia.<br>
<br>
Angeltheow's son was Eomer. According to the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, Angeltheow is a fourth-generation descendant of Woden, the same generation as Hengest and Horsa.<br>
<br>
It is claimed by some that Angeltheow may also be the Swedish king Ongentheow killed at the Battle of Ravenswood, however the battle took place some time after he is reported to have died, moreover it is unlikely that a British king would have also been able to maintain control over the Geats.<br>
</p>
Alexius III ANGELUS
<p>
<a name ="I015163"><b>[I015163]</b></a><br />
From Wikipedia<br>
<br>
Alexius III Angelus, Byzantine emperor, was the second son of Andronicus Angelus, nephew of Alexius I.<br>
<br>
In 1195, while his brother Isaac II was away hunting in Thrace, he was proclaimed emperor by the troops; he captured Isaac at Stagira in Macedonia, put out his eyes, and kept him henceforth a close prisoner, though he had been redeemed by him from captivity at Antioch and loaded with honours.<br>
<br>
To compensate for this crime and to confirm his position as emperor, he had to scatter money so lavishly as to empty his treasury, and to allow such licence to the officers of the army as to leave the Empire practically defenceless. He consummated the financial ruin of the state. The able and forceful empress Euphrosyne tried in vain to sustain his credit and his court; Vatatzes, the favourite instrument of her attempts at reform, was assassinated by the emperor's orders.<br>
<br>
Eastward the Empire was overrun by the Seljuk Turks; from the north Bulgarians and Vlachs descended unchecked to ravage the plains of Macedonia and Thrace; while Alexius squandered the public treasure on his palaces and gardens. Soon he was threatened by a new and yet more formidable danger. In 1202 the Western princes of the Fourth Crusade assembled at Venice, bent on a new crusade. Alexius, son of the deposed Isaac, escaped from Constantinople and appealed to the crusaders, promising as a crowning bribe to heal the schism of East and West if they would help him to depose his uncle.<br>
<br>
The crusaders, whose objective had been Egypt, were persuaded to set their course for Constantinople, before which they appeared in June 1203, proclaiming Alexius as emperor Alexius IV and summoning the capital to depose his uncle. Alexius III, sunk in debauchery, took no efficient measures to resist. His son-in-law, Lascaris, who was the only one to do anything, was defeated at Scutari, and the siege of Constantinople began. On the July 17 the crusaders, the aged doge Enrico Dandolo at their head, scaled the walls and took the city by storm. During the fighting and carnage that followed Alexius hid in the palace, and finally, with one of his daughters, Irene, and such treasures as he could collect, got into a boat and escaped to Develton in Thrace, leaving his wife, his other daughters and his Empire to the victors. Isaac, drawn from his prison and robed once more in the imperial purple, received his son in state.<br>
<br>
Shortly afterwards Alexius made an effort in conjunction with Murtzuphlos (Alexius V) to recover the throne. The attempt was unsuccessful and, after wandering about Greece, he surrendered with Euphrosyne, who had meanwhile joined him, to Boniface of Montferrat, then master of a great part of the Balkan peninsula (the so-called Kingdom of Thessalonica). Leaving his protection he sought shelter with Michael, despot of Epirus, and then repaired to Asia Minor, where his son-in-law Lascaris was holding his own against the Latins.<br>
<br>
Alexius, joined by Kay Khusrau I, the sultan of Rüm (also called the sultan of Iconium or Konya), now demanded the crown of Lascaris, and on his refusal marched against him. Lascaris, however, defeated and took him prisoner. Alexius was relegated to a monastery at Nicaea, where he died on some date unknown.<br>
</p>
Isaac II ANGELUS
<p>
<a name ="I007546"><b>[I007546]</b></a><br />
From Wikipedia<br>
<br>
Isaac II Angelus, Byzantine emperor 1185-1195, and again 1203-1204, was the successor of Andronicus I.<br>
<br>
He inaugurated his reign by a decisive victory over the Normans in Sicily, but elsewhere his policy was less successful. He failed in an attempt to recover Cyprus from the rebellious noble Isaac Comnenos thanks to Norman interference and by the oppressiveness of his taxes drove the Bulgarians and Vlachs to revolt (1186). In 1187 Alexius Branas, the general sent against the rebels, treacherously turned his arms against his master, and attempted to seize Constantinople, but was defeated and slain. The emperor's attention was next demanded in the east, where several claimants to the throne successively rose and fell. In 1189 Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor sought and obtained leave to lead his troops on the Third Crusade through the Byzantine Empire; but he had no sooner crossed the border than Isaac, who had meanwhile sought an alliance with Saladin, threw every impediment in his way, and was only compelled by force of arms to fulfil his engagements.<br>
<br>
The next five years were disturbed by fresh rebellions of the Vlachs, against whom Isaac led several expeditions in person. During one of these, in 1195, Alexius, the emperor's brother, taking advantage of the latter's absence from camp on a hunting expedition, proclaimed himself emperor, and was readily recognised by the soldiers. Isaac was blinded and imprisoned in Constantinople. After eight years he was raised for six months from his dungeon to his throne once more after the arrival of the knights of the Fourth Crusade. But both mind and body had been enfeebled by captivity, and his son Alexius IV was the actual monarch. Isaac died in 1204, shortly after the usurpation of his general, Mourzouphles. He was one of the weakest and most vicious princes that occupied the Byzantine throne. Surrounded by a crowd of slaves, mistresses and flatterers, he permitted his empire to be administered by unworthy favourites, while he squandered the money wrung from his provinces on costly buildings and expensive gifts to the churches of his metropolis.<br>
</p>
Bathild of ANGLIA
<p>
<a name ="I010060"><b>[I010060]</b></a><br />
Balthild or Bathilde (Anglo-Saxon meaning "bold battle") (c. 627 - January 30, 680), queen of Neustria and Burgundy, was born in Anglia, but was sold into slavery in the French royal court. She may originally have been related to Ricbehrt, the last pagan king of East Anglia.<br>
<br>
She was a member of the household of King Clovis II's chief administrator, Echinoald, who intended her to be his wife. Under these conditions of slavery, she came into contact with, and eventually married, King Clovis II. She bore him three sons who all became king after his death: Chlotar, Childeric and Theuderic.<br>
<br>
When Clovis died in 655, she took over as regent until Chlotar came of age in 664 and thereafter was forced into a convent for the remainder of her life. During her reign, mindful of her own slavery, she managed to outlaw the practice in Francia. She was later canonised as a saint by Pope Nicholas I.<br>
