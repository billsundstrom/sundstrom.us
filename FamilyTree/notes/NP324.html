Sara Adéla LIDMAN
<p>
<a name ="I055612"><b>[I055612]</b></a><br />
After her divorce, she had a long-time relationship with fellow author Ivar Lo-Johansson.<br>
----------------------------------------------------<br>
She lives forever in our hearts <br>
Sara Lidman, 80, became one of our greatest storytellers. She was tough and stubborn as a mountain birch. One of those that you can not say how old it is, but that has been there forever. And that will remain. Long after it has died. Just like Sara Lidman. She died yesterday at a nursing home in Umeå. But will remain. All did not like Sara Lidman. Many hated her views, she stood to the left, felt bad about US policy and said it too. Many city dwellers could not understand her persistent struggle for northern Sweden and Norrland. Others just thought her pathos felt threatening. As it often does for people who themselves do not have anything. She was born in 1923 in Missenträsk, a small cave near Jörn in Västerbotten. <br>
--------------------------------------------------------<br>
Swedish novelist, dramatist and social commentator. Born Sara Adela Lidman in Missenträsk, Sweden, on December 30, 1923; daughter of Andreas Lidman and Jenny (Lundman) Lidman; educated at the University of Uppsala.<br>
Sara Lidman was born in 1923 into a family of farmers in a remote village of the Västerbotten (West Bothnia) region in the far north (Norrland) of Sweden, an area that is regarded as part of southern Lapland. Later to describe herself as "a pious child," she grew up in a land far removed from the sophistication of Stockholm, and her isolation from the modern world was reinforced by the strict puritanical pietism of her conservative Lutheran parents and neighbors. A bout with tuberculosis in her early teens kept Lidman homebound for an extended period of time, and she became a voracious reader, immersing herself in works by Dostoyevsky and Kierkegaard as well as several Swedish regional novelists. At the same time, she began writing her own stories. Because of her fragile health, she continued her education through correspondence courses and completed her secondary education at a local private school. Moving to Stockholm in 1944, Lidman supported herself by working as a waitress, and she enrolled as a drama student at a local theater. In 1949, she completed her higher education at the University of Uppsala, having studied education, English and French.<br>

Georgia Rosett LIEBENGUTH
<p>
<a name ="I077264"><b>[I077264]</b></a><br />
eorgia was born on May 4, 1909 in Alexandria, Minnesota, moving to Barrett Minnesota where she lived until, her family moved to Bowman California just East of Auburn. Living In Bowman she attended Ackerman Grammer School, then Placer High School in Auburn. After graduating in June of 1927 she moved to Modesto California and attended Modesto Junior College. During this time frame Georgia met Willard J, Thomas and they started courting. On August 16, 1930 Georgia and Bill were Married in Modesto, California. They lived on 527 Sycamore, and then moved to 115 Madera. <br>
On December 11, 1934 Carole Jean Thomas was born to the joy of both Bill and Georgia, Carole was a very bright young girl, impressing the entire family. Soon a illness set in her kidneys and she died on February 2, 1942. This was a very large blow to both Bill and Georgia and it took a very long time for them to overcome it, if they ever did.<br>
On September 2, 1944 the answer to their prayers came in a harsh way. Gretchen Ruth, Georgia's sister, died from an anuerism in the brain giving birth to George Herman Ruth. Robert Ruth was approached by Gretchen's sister Georgia and brother-in-law: Willard J. Thomas and asked if they could adopt Douglas (who's name at birth was George Herman Ruth )and his brother Lester.Robert knew he could not take care of a newborn, so he consented to the adoption of Douglas only.At adoption George Herman's name was changed to Douglas Ruth Thomas. <br>
Bill, Georgia, and Doug moved to a new house on 636 Duncan Ave. in then North East Modesto in 1950. I moved to Modesto in 1951 and stayed a year and returned to Auburn. In 1954 moving back with them until 1958. I can say that without Bill and Georgia in my life it would have turned out much different for the worst. They did put me on the straight and narrow path and put up with nothing from Doug or I. Here they stayed until 1984 when the yard and house became to much for them, moving to 2808 B Sherwood, in Modesto, they lived on Sherwood until 1986 when Bill died. Georgia then moved to 3549 Veneman Ave. in Modesto were she lived until her death in December 01, 1992, and was buried at Acacia Memorial Park Modesto CA. TR-5, Gr. E1/2 69.<br>
Georgia was very active in the Modesto Emblem Club and was elected President in or about 1956. She was very active in the local Charities of the Modesto Area and my Brother still volunteers each year for the same one's. Georgia also started the Modesto City Clearing House for Charities, so people could not collect food from more than one place in one day.Georgia also made time to work at the tire shop for about eight years before it was sold. She kept one of the cleanest houses I have ever seen, just like her grandmother Matilda Liebenguth. Her mother use to say " she is just like her grandmother"Doug and I called her the Mad German, and yes when she was not around, and when she was it was just the ( M.G. ).Doug is now living in the same house and claims she is still there watching his every move, turning things on and off with the garage doors going open and closed at all hours of the day and night. He even lelt a dust rag out to see whatwould happen, Dust was still there the next day.A long and very humorists story.<br>

In 1960 the Liedtke brothers began a cooperative drilling program with the South Penn Oil Company and set up Stetco Petroleum, of which William Liedtke was president.
