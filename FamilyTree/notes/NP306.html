Hugo KREYENHAGEN
<p>
<a name ="I109782"><b>[I109782]</b></a><br />
The late Hugo Kreyenhagen was born at what is now Oakland, California, November 2, 1858, and was the son of Gustave and Julia (Tiering) Kreyenhagen, who was one of the most important cattlemen of Fresno county.<br>
Hugo Kreyenhagen received his education at the Christian Brothers college in Oakland, and soon after his school clays were ended he entered the stock business with his three brothers, and they ultimately became the largest cattlemen in Fresno county. For many years they raised both sheep and cattle, but later gave up sheep and devoted their activities entirely to cattle raising south of Coalinga.<br>
Mr. Hugo Kreyenhagen sold out his cattle business about two years prior to his death, June 1, 1929, and the last few years of his life were spent happily with his wife and son in the city of Coalinga.<br>
He will long be remembered as one of Fresno county's most outstanding citizens, and as a worthy representative of the famous Kreyenhagen who have done so much for the development of the stock raising industry in the San Joaquin Valley.<br>
Mrs. Kreyenhagen was Maria Merrill. She survives her husband with two children: Mrs. Olga Newport of Hanford and Ernest Hugo Kreyenhagen of Coalinga.<br>
-------------------------------------------------<br>
HUGO KREYENHAGEN Nestling among the font-hills of the Coast Range mountains and extending back from the northern end of the Kettleman plains, lies the Canoas Rancho, one of the three large ranches owned by the Kreyenhagens, and the residence of Hugo Kreyenhagen. The house is large, comfortable and modern, and is gracefully presided over bv his accomplished wife; both Mr. and Mrs. Kreyenhagen being liberal and kind hearted vie with each other in dispensing old-time Californian hospitality. Hugo Kreyenhagen was born in the Oak Openings, at what was then called West Point, now Oakland, Cal.. November 2, 1858. His father, Gustave a native of Germany, was a college graduate and a man of scholarly attainments who was master of six languages. He was married in his native country to Julia Ilering. and about 1853 came to St. Louis, Mo., where he was an instructor in a college until he came to San Francisco, Cal., via Panama. He was engaged in the mercantile business and it was during his residence at West Point that Hugo was born. Afterwards he engaged in sheep raising on the Peach Tree Ranch in Monterey County, and also on a ranch near Gilroy.<br>
In about 1867 he located on the West Side of the San Joaquin Valley, at a place which became known as Kreyenhagens' Corners, where he ran a store and raised sheep until Los Banos was started in the same locality and he became one of the first settlers of the new town, built a store and a hotel, and was in business there at the same time with his sons ; he also continued sheep-raising as well as freighting. He sold his holdings there and in 1876<br>
located at Posa Chene, now Turk Station, Fresno County, where he built a store, hotel, livery stable and sheep corrals, and with his sons engaged in the merchandise<br>
business and stock-raising, also in buying land.<br>
He owned Fresno Hot Springs, where he built a hotel and made improvements a place still owned by the estate and here he and his wife spent their last days, a worthy couple much esteemed for their culture and high moral and religious principles. Of their five children who grew to maturity, Hugo is the second oldest. He learned the stock business, riding the range and assisting in grain-raising. His education was obtained in Christian Brothers College, Oakland, and when his school days were ended he threw all of his energies into the stock business in which he and his brothers have been so successful.<br>
He came to Posa Chene when he was a young man of eighteen, so he has seen all of the wonderful development of the West Side, in which he has taken a part and of which he can be justly proud. The four brothers Kreyenhagen continued together, raising both sheep and cattle, running about 10,000 head of sheep and 600 head of cattle. Later they disposed of their sheep and devoted their whole range to raising cattle, and are today undoubtedly the largest individual cattle growers in Fresno County. They purchased land from time to time until they own three large adjoining ranches known as "Canoas," "Zapato Cheno," and "Los Polvaderos." lying southeast of Coalinga and embracing about 10,000 acres.<br>
The ranches are well watered by wells and streams and springs, the latter extending back into the foot-hills of the Coast Range, making them well adapted for cattle-raising. Besides these ranches they lease about 33,000 acres of railroad and other lands, thus having an important and valuable range for their large herds of graded Durhams and Herfords for they use full-blooded bulls of those strains at the head of their herds. However, they also bring in whole trainloads of cattle from Mexico, Arizona and Utah, turning them on their range until they are in condition to ship to the markets. The brothers also raise about 2.000 acres of grain each year, using a caterpillar engine and combined harvester. They established and owned the Crescent Meat Market in Coalinga, later selling it to M. Levy.<br>
A few years ago Kreyenhagen Brothers (four of them) incorporated their holdings as Kreyenhagens, Inc., being a close corporation including only members of the family. They are alsd largely interested in the Hays Cattle Company, operating a large stock ranch in Arizona. On the Avanal Ranch near Dudly in Kings County, on August 19, 1883, occurred the marriage of Hugo Kreyenhagen with Miss Marie Merrill, a native daughter of California, born at Benicia. Solano County. Her father, Caleb S. Merrill, Jr., born at Sheldon Falls, Mass.. and reared in Illinois, when seventeen years of age crossed the plains with his father and family in an ox team train in 1852. Grandfather, Caleb S. Merrill, Sr., was an architect and builder and followed that business in the early days. He resided in California until he was seventy-eight, then he returned to Missouri and there he died. Caleb S. Merrill, Jr.. married Jennie Larseneur, who was born in Canada of an old French-Canadian family. Her father. Peter Larseneur, brought his family to California in 1852. He was also a contractor, and with Caleb S. Merrill as a partner, built many of the early buildings in Benicia. among them the old Benicia Barracks. Afterwards he was a contractor in San Francisco, and among the many buildings he erected was the old Stock exchange. Mrs. Kreyenhagen's father was a stock-raiser on the General Neiglee ranch at Bantos for many years, then a farmer near Stockton until 1878, when he purchased the Avanal Ranch in Tulare, but now Kings County. Here he raised cattle and sheep, having large herds and flocks on this large area of land and being actively engaged until his death. His widow after-wards disposed of the ranch and for some years made her home in Oakland. She spent her last days in Coalinga, where she died in 1916. Of the eight children born to this worthy pioneer couple, five are living, of whom Mrs. Kreyenhagen is the oldest. She received a good education in the schools of Stockton and at Lemoore.<br>
Mr. and Mrs. Hugo Kreyenhagen have two children : Olga, a graduate of the Hanford High School and the Oakland Polytechnic, then spent two years in the University of California, is now the wife of A. L. Newport of Hanford: Ernest Hugo, a graduate of the Coalinga Union High, spent two years as a student at the University of California in Berkeley,, enlisted for service in the United States Army, serving in the California Grizzlies, Battery E, 144th Regiment Artillery, Fortieth Division. Since his honorable discharge he is assisting his father on the ranch, being a stockholder and director in the Kreyenhagens. Inc., as well as a stockholder in the Hays Cattle Company. Mrs. Kreyenhagen is a member of Lucerne Chapter No. 127, O. E. S., at Hanford, and is a member of the Presbyterian Church. Interested in the cause of education Mr. Kreyenhagen has served as school trustee, keeping up the high standard of the schools of the state. He is a member of the California Cattle Growers" Association.<br>
Mr. and Mrs. Kreyenhagen took part in the different drives for war funds, to which they were liberal contributors, and both are life members of the Coalinga Chapter of the American National Red Cross. Enterprising and progressive, they are never backward in giving of their means and influence to further worthy movements for the upbuilding of the great commonwealth where they were born and where every portion is dear to them. Fortunate is the individual who has the pleasure of being entertained at the Canoas Ranch. Mr. Kreyenhagen is a protectionist and Republican in politics.<br>

Ricky Brian Krouse, 52, of Manitowoc, Wisconsin passed away unexpectedly on Saturday 2/11/17 in Surprise, Arizona.<br>
Ricky was born to Faye Aubol Budysz and the late Roger Krouse in Manitowoc, Wisconsin on 2/7/1965. Ricky attended Lincoln High School.<br>

A rugged individualist, Ricky was known for his offbeat sense of humor, sense of adventure, love for the outdoors, fearless nature, and collecting unique things. Ricky found peace in nature and loved camping, fishing, and hiking. Great with his hands, no project was impossible for him and few could outwork him. Ricky was a big hearted man, few on fancy words, he seldom boasted about himself or considered others beneath him. It was hard not to love Ricky, and it will be exceedingly hard moving forward without him.<br>
