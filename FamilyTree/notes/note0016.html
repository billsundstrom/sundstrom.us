Ingvar or Yngvar Harra, Proto-Norse *Ingu-Hariz (d. early 7th century) was the son of Östen and reclaimed the Swedish throne for the House of Yngling after the Swedes had rebelled against Sölvi.<br />
 <br />
Snorri Sturluson relates that King Ingvar, Östen's son, was a great warrior who often spent time patrolling the shores of his kingdom fighting Danes and pirates from the east. King Ingvar finally came to a peace agreement with the Danes and could take care of the Estonian pirates.<br />
 <br />
He consequently started pillaging in Estonia in retribution, and one summer he arrived at a place called Stein (see also Sveigder). The Estonians (sýslu kind) assembled a great army in the interior and attacked King Ingvar in a great battle. The Estonian forces were too powerful and Ingvar fell and the Swedish forces retreated. Ingvar was buried in a mound at a place called Stone or Hill fort (at Steini) on the shores of Estonia (Ađalsýsla).<br />

 <br />
Ynglingatal only mentions the location Sysla (area paying tribute), Historia Norwegiae only mentions that he died during a campaign on the island Eycilla (Ösel). It also adds second son named Sigvard.<br />
 <br />
Thorsteins saga V́ıkingssonar skips Ingvar's generation and makes his father Östen the father of Anund and grand-father of Ingjald. It adds a second son to Östen named Olaf, who was the king of Fjordane in Norway.<br />

Anund, Brøt-Anundr (Old East Norse) or Braut-Önundr (Old West Norse), meaning trail-blazer Anund or Anund the land-clearer, d. ca 640, was a legendary Swedish king of the House of Yngling.<br />
 <br />
Anund succeeded his father Ingvar on the Swedish throne, and after his father's wars against Danish vikings and Estonian pirates, peace reigned over Sweden and there were good harvests. Anund was a popular king who became very rich, not only because of the peace and the good harvests but also because he avenged his father in Estonia. That country was ravaged far and wide and in the autumn Anund returned with great riches.<br />
 <br />
In those days Sweden was dominated by vast and uninhabited forests, so Anund started making roads and clearing land and vast districts were settled by Swedes. Consequently he was named Bröt-Anund. He made a house (Husby) for himself in every district and used to stay as a guest in many homes.<br />
 <br />
One autumn, King Anund was travelling between his halls (see Husbys) and came to a place called Himinheiđr (sky heath) between two mountains. He was surprised by a landslide which killed him.<br />
    We all have heard how Jonkur's sons,<br />
    Whom weapons could not touch, with stones<br />
    Were stoned to death in open day,<br />
    King Onund died in the same way.<br />
    Or else perhaps the wood-grown land,<br />
    Which long had felt his conquering hand,<br />
    Uprose at length in deadly strife,<br />
    And pressed out Onund's hated life.<br />
 <br />
The original text of Ynglingatal is hard to interprete, and it only says that Anund died und Himinfjöllum (under the sky mountains) and that stones were implied. According to Historia Norwegiae, he was murded by his brother Sigvard in Himinherthy (which the source says means "the fields of the sky", cœli campus. Such a place name is not known and Birger Nerman suggests that the original place of death was under the sky mountains, i.e. under the clouds (cf. the etymology of cloud). Consequently, he may have been killed outdoors, by his brother and with a stone.<br />
 <br />
Thorsteins saga V́ıkingssonar says that Anund was not the son of Ingvar, but the son of his grand-father Östen. It also relates that he had a brother named Olaf who was the king of Fjordane.<br />
 <br />
All sources say that Anund was the father of the infamous Ingjald ill-ruler.<br />

Alline Margaret Huycke, age 81, of 1255 West 18th St., Oshkosh, where shehas resided for the past six years, entered into eternal rest on Monday,Feb. 14, 2005 at the Mercy Medical Center in Oshkosh, from complicationsof a stroke.<br />
Mass of Christian Burial will be held at 11 a.m. on Friday, Feb. 18, 2005 at Holy Cross Catholic Church in Mishicot, with the Rev. Paul Paider officiating. Burial will follow in the Holy Cross Cemetery in Two Rivers.<br />
Alline was born June 27, 1923 in St. Paul, Minn., to the late Aloys and Marion Bailey Sailor. She served in the United States Navy during World War II as a WAVE in Washington, D.C., and later completed her bachelor's degree in education. She married Albert Raymond Huycke on Sept. 15, 1956.<br />
She is survived by one daughter: Judy (Joseph) Hoffmann of Oshkosh; four sons: Jon (Marilyn) Huycke of California; James (Christine) Huycke of Racine; Joseph (Gail) Huycke of Phillips, Wis.; Jeffery Huycke of Mishicot; and by nine grandchildren; one great-grandchild; and a sister: Marilyn (Ralph) Rolland of Lake Carlos, Minn. In addition to her parents, she was also preceded in death by her husband, Albert in 1984.<br />
Relatives and friends may call after 9:30 a.m. on Friday at Holy Cross Catholic Church in Mishicot, until the time of service at 11 a.m. There will be no Thursday evening visitation.<br />
The Lambert-Eckert Funeral Home of Mishicot is assisting the Huycke family with funeral arrangements.<br />
Alline exhaled her last breath on Earth on Valentine's Day, to the final cords of Mozart's "Sonata in A Major" and moved with the same grace in which she lived her life into the arms of God. Unable to speak due to a stroke, she prayed intensely with her eyes on the cross as a rosary was said that morning. To her children she leaves a great legacy of the love of God, a deep and intimate appreciation of the earth without an attachment to weigh her soul, an immersion in the arts and philosophy, and in all that is good in humanity through God.<br />
Born the second daughter to the circulation editor of the St. Paul Dispatch, she was well-educated and experienced the Roaring '20s through her parents' enjoyment of that easy life, until The Great Depression struck her family with the same devastation that it struck most others. A survivor of polio as a child and an A student, Alline was prepared to endure the hardships. With her maiden name, Sailor, she enlisted in the Navy during World War II, and an article on the front page of the Dispatch announced with a twinkle, "A Sailor Joins the Navy." She was honorably discharged after the war, but took with her the seeds of tuberculosis, resulting in two years of bed-rest for recovery. She attended college with some studies in Fribourg, Switzerland, and achieved a degree in education. When Alline's friend Helen, who has shared the TB experience, died after childbirth, Alline visited Helen's widower, Albert, and a romance led quickly to marriage. The sophisticated city woman moved with Albert to an isolated country spot on a river north of Mishicot, and four more children were added to the family. Alline immersed herself in child-raising and vegetable-raising and entwined in her children's lives the beauty of the humanities and that of nature. She volunteered with the elderly and infirm, and stayed active in local educational and community issues. After Albert's death, Post-Polio Syndrome slowed down her body, but her compassionate interactions with the world continued throughout her life. She truly cultured and cultivated, and her garden grows on. Our friend, our mentor, our mother, we will miss you greatly.<br />

Autobiography:<br />
I suppose a biography should begin at the begining, but my childhood was comparatively uneventful, and I will just briefly touch on those things which may have affected my present attitudes.<br />
Serious illness seems to have had a profound effect on my life.  Although I have had only minimal use for doctors for the greater part of my life, I did have two illnesses involving hospitalization.  First was a brief, and thankfully very light acquaintance with polio.  because of the epidemic then (early thirties), the doctor recognized the early symptoms, and I was given a serum that, though experimental, apparantly did keep me from permanent paralysis.  This was my first experience with a fairly long period of bed rest.  The second illness was much later.<br />
Moving from the neighborhood we had grown to love at the time I was begining the seventh grade was a somewhat traumatic experience because it caused a severing of close friendships.  I remained in the same school because it was a parochial school, and I had only two years to complete, but htere was no after school contact with my friends, and I began a prolonged aquaintance with loneliness.  This was not althogether bad because it enabled me to develop a habit of independent thinking and a love of reading.  Summers brought the delightful relief of weeks in the country visiting grandparents and great-grandparents on their farms, and two wonderful weeks a a lake resort fishing and swimming.  My love of country began then, and my favorite daydream was owning a home in the country.<br />
Another traumatic experience which acquainted me with the tensions experienced by the poor was my father's loss of job during the summer between my sophomore and junior years of high school.  My values were in for a sudden shock.  We had always been financially secure, but the consolidation od newspapers in the area at this time caused many newspaper executives to be out of work, and it was impossible for my father to botain another position in the only field ha had ever known.  I did not reurn to school in the fall, but tried to find some kind of work to help bring in at least a trickle of money.  I sonn found that the only kind of work I could get was housework and baby-sitting.  I did that until the gegingin of the second semester, when my sister, who had graduated that same year, spoke to the sisters at the academy and arrainged for me to work after school to pay my tuition.  I returned to school and doubled up on some classes to make up for the semester I had missed .  I had a new appreciation for education and graduated Magna Cum Laude.  I learned that things that come to us without effort are never appreciated.<br />
Since I graduated in 1941, the war soon affected my life.  I had not planned to enlist, but was working in an office across the street from a recruiting office and was talked into stopping in there on a lunch hour with a friend who wanted to find out about the Navy.  When they learned my name (my maiden name is Sailor), they wouldn't give up on me until I had enlisted.  Two and one-half years as a W.A.V.E. in Washington, D.C. followed.<br />
This part of my life was an education in meeting people of varied backgrounds and an opportunity to travel along the east coast.  I also learned a bit about helping people at times of stress.  As Yeoman in charge of the leave and liberty section of a very large station, I had to process emergency leaves and report the daily muster (attendance), among other duties.  This brought me into contact with those experienceing death in the family and other stresses whish caused some to go AWOL.  I took care of Red Cross investigations and arranged priority transportation.  Sometimes I had to say no when the emergency did not involve a member of the immediate family, but often I would fight with Naval Barracks to obatin leave in caes that seemed exceptional, such as a grandmother who was like a mother to the person applying, or, as in one case, a fiance of a WAVE officer who was merely asking to take leave and apply it the nesxt year's leave.  I learned to deal with bureaucracy and to  ascertain the fake from the real.<br />
 <br />
After the war came my second bout with serious illness.  My x-ray at the time of discharge showed suspicious shadows, which on further examination was determined to be tuberculosis.  Since theis was before the time of drugs which are now used, I entered a sanatorium for the "rest cure". Both lungs were involved, though minimally, and surgery was not considered.  before long it was obvious I could rest as well at home, and there followed two years of complete bed rest at my mother's home. Luckily I did not know at the time that it would take that long or I might have experienced considerable depression.  As it was, each month after my monthly check-up, I hoped to hear the doctor say, "You can start getting up now."  But it was to be a total of two and one-half years before he said that.  And then the getting up was very gradual:  Meals first, one at a time, then walks, five minutes twice a day increasing by five minutes each week until I had attained an hour twice a day .  I was ready for the world again.   Oddly enough, I never felt these years were wasted.  I read a lot, knitted and crocheted, listened to debates on the radio (no TV in those days), and prayed.  A good part of my reading was on the subject of health.  Once you are that sick, you make up your mind it isn't going to happen again.<br />
 <br />
College followed:  two years at St. Teresa's in Winona, asummer session at the University of Fribourg, Switzerland, and two years at St. Cloud State Teachers College.  The last two years I regretted.  I received excellent grades but I learned very little.  The classes were sheer boredom--too many methods courses.  My ambition is to take more courses in the subjects I really enjoy:  philosophy, English, foreign languages, history.  History?  How strange.  In high school I hated it.<br />
 <br />
So I had a B.S. in education and a teacher's certificate, but did I teach?  Oh, no.  I returned to secretarila work.  I became a job hopper, finally ending up as Research Asssistant to the General Manager of Group Health.  Along about then I met the man who would become my husband and changed my career objective.  I becam a homemaker and loved it, though heaven knows, it wasn't easy.  I was 33 and knew very little about cooking, housekeeping, or children.  I had to learn fast because my husband was a widower with a two and a half year old child.  On our first wedding anniversary I went to the hospital and delivered a seven pound boy.  We were both delighted, bcause at my age I was a little afraid I might be too old to have children, and now little Jon had a brother!  I needn't have worried; two more boys followed in quick succession, then a finally a girl.  We had moved to the country in the second year of our marriage, and had many happy years with the house full of no ise, confusion, love and hard work.<br />
After the children were all out of high school, I took a part-time secretarial job, but after three years the business collapsed and I was nearing sixty and looking for work at a time when the unemployment rate was skyrocketing.  Since then I have worked on a few temporary jobs, but did not look for anything permanent because of my husband's health.  He had sustained s serious heart attack two years ago, and this past June died after about three months of serious illness and much suffering.<br />
I am pleased with this opportunity to do volunteer work of such significance.   After my bout with tuberculosis, I had spent some time in Legion of Mary work and part of that work was calling on shut-ins, many of whom were elderly.  I was shocked to find old people unable to get out and no one coming to visit them.  I do hope we will be able to make a significant contribution to meeting the needs of these people.<br />
  She resided 1255 West 18th Avenue, Oshkosh, Wisconsin on 23 Oct 2003 in Oshkosh, Winnebago County, Wisconsin.  She died on 14 Feb 2005 in Oshkosh, Winnebago County, Wisconsin.<br />

John of Brienne (c. 1148-1237), king of Jerusalem and Latinemperor-regent of Constantinople, was a man of sixty years of age beforehe began to play any considerable part in history.<br />
 <br />
He was the second son of Erard II, count of Brienne, in Champagne. Destined originally for the Church, he had preferred to become a knight, and in forty years of tournaments and fights he had won himself a considerable reputation, when in 1208 envoys came from the Holy Land to ask Philip Augustus, king of France, to select one of his barons as husband to the heiress and ruler of the Kingdom of Jerusalem. Philip selected John of Brienne, and promised to support him in his new dignity. In 1210 John married the heiress Maria (daughter of Isabella and Conrad of Montferrat), assuming the title of king in right of his wife. In 1211, after some desultory operations, he concluded a six years' truce with Malik-el-Adil; in 1212 he lost his wife, who left him a daughter, Yolande (also known as Isabella); soon afterwards he married the Armenian princess Stephanie.<br />
 <br />
In the Fifth Crusade (1218-1221) he was a prominent figure. The legate Pelagius of Albano, however, claimed the command; and insisting on the advance from Damietta, in spite of John's warnings, he refused to accept the favourable terms of the sultan, as the king advised, until it was too late. After the failure of the crusade, King John came to the West to obtain help for his kingdom. In 1223 he met Pope Honorius III and the emperor Frederick II at Ferentino, where, in order that he might be connected more closely with the Holy Land, Frederick was betrothed to John's daughter Isabella, now heiress of the kingdom. After the meeting at Ferentino, John went to France and England, finding little consolation; and thence he travelled to Santiago de Compostela, where King Alfonso IX of Leon offered him the hand of one of his daughters and the promise of his kingdom. John passed over Alfonso's eldest daughter and heiress in favor of a younger daughter, Berengaria of Castile. After a visit to Germany he returned to Rome (1225). Here he received a demand from Frederick II (who had now married Isabella) that he should abandon his title and dignity of king, which, so Frederick claimed, had passed to himself along with the heiress of the kingdom. John was now a septuagenarian "king in exile," but he was still vigorous enough to revenge himself on Frederick, by commanding the papal troops which attacked southern Italy during the emperor's absence on the Sixth Crusade (1228-1229).<br />
 <br />
In 1229 John, now eighty years of age, was invited by the barons of the Latin Empire of Constantinople to become emperor-regent, on condition that Baldwin of Courtenay should marry his second daughter and succeed him. For nine years he ruled in Constantinople, and in 1235, with a few troops, he repelled a great siege of the city by John III Ducas Vatatzes, emperor of Nicaea, and Ivan Asen II of Bulgaria.<br />
 <br />
After this last feat of arms, which has perhaps been exaggerated by the Latin chroniclers, who compare him to Hector and the Maccabees, John died in the habit of a Franciscan friar. An aged paladin, somewhat uxorious and always penniless, he was a typical knight errant, whose wanderings led him all over Europe, and planted him successively on the thrones of Jerusalem and Constantinople.<br />
 <br />
John of Brienne married three times. By his first wife, Marie of Montferrat, he had one child, Yolande, later Queen of Jerusalem. He had also one child by his second wife, Stephanie of Armenia, a son named as successor in Armenia, but died in childhood. By his third wife, Berengaria of Castile, he had 4 children:<br />
   1. Marie de Brienne (1225-1275), who married Emperor Baldwin II of Constantinople.<br />
   2. Alphonso of Brienne (c.1228-1270), who married Marie d'Issoudon, countess of Eu, and became count of Eu in right of his wife, and was also Great Chamberlain of France.<br />
   3. John II of Brienne (c.1230-1273), who in 1258 became Grand Butler of France.<br />
   4. Louis of Acre (c.1235-1263), who married Agnes of Beaumont and became Viscount of Beaumont in her right.<br />

The following puts this lineage into question.<br />
 <br />
From Wikipedia<br />
 <br />
William de Clinton, 1st Earl of Huntingdon and Lord High Admiral, was the younger son of Baron Clinton of Marstock. The Clinton's were a great Norman family who had arrived with William the Conqueror in 1066. The surname Clinton came from the lordship of Clinton in Oxfordshire, given to them at the Conquest. Geoffrey de Clinton was Lord Chamberlain and Treasurer of Henry I, while Roger de Clinton was Bishop of Coventry 1127-1148.<br />
 <br />
William de Clinton was born in 1304, and a boyhood companion of Edward III. William was one of the followers of Edward III who secretly entered Nottingham Castle and captured Roger Mortimer, Earl of March. The arrest and subsequent execution of Mortimer cleared the way for the adolescent Edward III to assume power. In 1333, Edward III created William de Clinton earl of Huntingdon. William de Clinton died childless.<br />

 <br />
Ingjaldr inn illráđi or Ingjald illråde ("ill-ruler"), ca 640 - ca 650, was a more or less historical Swedish king of the House of Ynglings. He was the son of Anund.<br />
 <br />
Youth<br />
The Heimskringla relates that the viceroy of Fjädrundaland was named Ingvar and he had two sons, Alf and Agnar, who were of the same age as Ingjald. Svipdag the Blind was the viceroy of Tiundaland, the province of Uppsala where the Tings and the Yule (Midwinter) sacrifices were held.<br />
 <br />
One Midwinter, when Ingjald and Alf were six years old, many people had assembled at Uppsala for the sacrifices. Alf and Ingjald played, but Ingjald found that he was the weaker boy and became so angry that he almost started to cry. His foster-brother Gautvid led him to his foster-father Svigdag the Blind and told Svipdag about Ingjald's lack of manliness and strength. Svipdag said that it was a shame and the next day he gave Ingjald a roasted wolf's heart to eat. From that day, Ingjald became a very ferocious person and had a bad disposition.<br />
 <br />
Anund arranged a marriage for his son Ingjald with Gauthild, the daughter of the Geatish king Algaut, who was the son of Gautrek the Mild and the grand-son of Gaut. Gautrek consented as he believed that Ingjald had inherited his father's disposition. Gauthild's maternal grandfather was Olof the Sharp-sighted, the king of Nerike.<br />
 <br />
The deceit<br />
Snorri Sturluson relates that when his father Anund had died, Ingjald became the king of Sweden. The kings at Uppsala were the foremost among the kings of the various provinces since Odin ruled the country, and they were the supreme chiefs of the other kingdoms since the death of Agne and Sweden was divided between Erik and Alrik. The descendants of these two kings had spread, cleared land and settled new territories, until there were several petty kings.<br />
 <br />
In honour of his own ascendance to the throne, Ingjald invited the kings, the jarls and other important men to a grand feast in a newly built hall, just as large and sumptuous as the one in Uppsala. It was called the hall of the seven kings and had seven high seats. Algaut the Geatish king of West Götaland, King Ingvar of Fjädrundaland with his two sons Agnar and Alf, King Sporsnjall of Nerike and King Sigvat of Attundaland came but not King Granmar of Södermanland. The kings filled all seven seats but one. All the prominent people of Sweden had seats, except for Ingjald's own court whom he had sent to his old hall in Uppsala.<br />
 <br />
According to the custom of the time for those who inherited kings and jarls, Ingjald rested at the footstool until the Bragebeaker was brought in. Then he was supposed to stand up, take the beaker and make solemn vows, after which he would ascend his father's high seat. However, when the beaker was brought in, he took a bull's horn and made the solemn vow that he would enlarge his own kingdom by half towards all the four quarters, towards which he pointed his horn, or die.<br />
 <br />
When all the prominent guests were drunk, he ordered Svipdag's sons, Gautvid and Hylvid, to arm themselves and their men and to leave the building. Outside, they set fire to the building which burnt down and those who tried to escape were killed.<br />
 <br />
Thus Ingjald made himself the sole ruler of the domains of the murdered kings.<br />
 <br />
Wars<br />
Granmar won allies in his son-in-law the sea-king Hjörvard of the Ylfings and his father-in-law Högne the Geatish king of East Götaland. They successfully withstood Ingjald's invasion where Ingjald realised that the men from the provinces he had conquered were not loyal to him. After a long standstill there was peace for as long as the three kings lived. However, one night Ingjald and his men sourrounded a farm where Granmar and Hjörvard were at a feast and burnt the house down. He late disposed of five more kings, and he thus earned the name Illråde (ill-ruler) as he fulfilled his promise.<br />
 <br />
Snorri Sturluson tells that it was a common saying that Ingjald killed twelve kings by deceiving them that he only wished for peace, and that he thus earned his cognomen Illråde (ill-ruler or ill-adviser).<br />
 <br />
Downfall<br />
Ingjald had two children, a son Olof Trätälja and a daughter Åsa. His daughter had inherited her father's psychopathic disposition. She married king Gudröd of Skåne. Before she murdered her husband she managed to make him kill his own brother Halfdan the Kind, the father of the great Ivar Vidfamne.<br />
 <br />
In order to avenge his father, Ivar Vidfamne gathered a vast host and departed for Sweden, where he found Ingjald at Ræning, probably Rällinge on the island of Fogdö in Lake Mälaren. When Ingjald and his daughter realized that it was futile to resist, they set the hall on fire and succumbed in the flames.<br />
 <br />
It is interesting to note that Ynglingatal does not appear to describe Ingjald as an evil king. It calls his life a brave life frœknu fjörvi.<br />
 <br />
Ingjald has often been seen as the one who unified Sweden.<br />

Lothair I (795 - March 2, 855), Holy Roman Emperor, was the eldest son ofthe emperor Louis the Pious and his wife Irmengarde (Ermengarde),daughter of Ingramm (Ingerman), the Duke of Hesbaye. Lothair is sometimesalso known as "Lothar".<br />
 <br />
Little is known of his early life, which was probably passed at the court of his grandfather Charlemagne, until 815 when he became ruler of Bavaria.<br />
 <br />
When Louis in 817 divided the Empire between his sons, Lothar was crowned joint emperor at Aix-la-Chapelle (Aachen) and given a certain superiority over his brothers. In 821 he married Irmengarde (d. 851), daughter of Hugo (Hugues), count of Tours; in 822 undertook the government of Italy; and, on the April 5, 823, was crowned emperor by Pope Paschal I at Rome, Italy.<br />
 <br />
In November 824 he promulgated a statute concerning the relations of pope and emperor which reserved the supreme power to the secular potentate, and he afterwards issued various ordinances for the good government of Italy.<br />
 <br />
On his return to his father's court his step-mother Judith won his consent to her plan for securing a kingdom for her son Charles the Bald, a scheme which was carried out in 829. Lothar, however, soon changed his attitude, and spent the succeeding decade in constant strife over the division of the Empire with his father. He was alternately master of the Empire, and banished and confined to Italy; at one time taking up arms in alliance with his brothers and at another fighting against them; whilst the bounds of his appointed kingdom were in turn extended and reduced.<br />
 <br />
When Louis I was dying in 840, he sent the imperial insignia to Lothar, who, disregarding the various partitions, claimed the whole of the Empire. Negotiations with his brother Louis the German and his half-brother Charles the Bald, both of whom armed to resist this claim, were followed by an alliance of the younger brothers against Lothar. A decisive battle was fought at Fontenay on June 25, 841, when, in spite of his personal gallantry, Lothar was defeated and fled to Aix. With fresh troops he entered upon a war of plunder, but the forces of his brothers were too strong for him, and taking with him such treasure as he could collect, he abandoned to them his capital.<br />
 <br />
Efforts to make peace were begun, and in June 842 the brothers met on an island in the Saone, and agreed to an arrangement which developed, after much difficulty and delay, into the Treaty of Verdun signed in August 843. By this Lothair received Italy and the imperial title, together with a stretch of land between the North and Mediterranean Seas lying along the valleys of the Rhine and the Rhone. He soon abandoned Italy to his eldest son, Louis, and remained in his new kingdom, engaged in alternate quarrels and reconciliations with his brothers, and in futile efforts to defend his lands from the attacks of the Northmen (as Vikings were known in Frankish writings) and the Saracens.<br />
 <br />
In 855 he became seriously ill, and despairing of recovery renounced the throne, divided his lands between his three sons, and on September 23, entered the monastery of Prüm (Pruem), where he died six days later. He was buried at Prüm, where his remains were found in 1860.<br />
 <br />
His kingdom was divided among his three sons - the eldest, Louis II, received Italy and the title of Emperor; the second, Lothair II, received Lotharingia, while the youngest, Charles, received Burgundy.<br />

Rudolph I, born 859, died October 25, 912, King of (Upper or Transjurane)Burgundy from his election in 888 until his death.<br />
 <br />
Rudolph belonged to the Welf family and was the son of Conrad, count of Auxerre, from whom he inherited the lay abbacy of St Maurice en Valais, making him the most powerful magnate in Upper Burgundy - present-day western Switzerland and the Franche Comté.<br />
 <br />
After the deposition and death of Charles the Fat, the nobles and leading clergy of Upper Burgundy met at St Maurice and elected Rudolph as king. Apparently on the basis of this election, Rudolph claimed the whole of Lotharingia, taking much of modern Lorraine and Alsace - but his claim was contested by Arnulf of Carinthia, the new king of East Francia or Germany, who rapidly forced Rudolph to abandon Lotharingia in return for recognition as king of Burgundy. However, hostilities between Rudolph and Arnulf seem to have continued intermittently until 894.<br />
 <br />
Rudolph's relationships with his other neighbours were friendlier. His sister Adelaide married Richard the Justiciar, duke of Burgundy (the present day Burgundy, part of west Francia), and his daughter, another Adelaide, married Louis the Blind of Provence (Lower Burgundy).<br />
 <br />
Rudolph was succeeded as king of Burgundy by his son, Rudolph II.<br />

Rudolf II (died July 11, 937) King of Upper Burgundy (912-937), King ofLower Burgundy (Provence) (933-937), King of Italy (effective, 922-926 -claim abandoned 933). He was the son of Rudolf I, king of Upper Burgundy.<br />
 <br />
Following his ascension to the throne in 912, Rudolf was asked by several Italian nobles to intervene in Italy on their behalf against Emperor Berengar in 922. Having entering Italy, he was crowned King of the Lombards at Pavia. In 923, he defeated Berengar at Piacenza; Berengar was murdered the following year, possibly at the instigation of Rudolf. The king then ruled Upper Burgundy and Italy together, residing alternately in both kingdoms. However, in 926 the Italian nobility turned against him and requested that Hugh of Arles, the effective ruler of Provence (or Lower Burgundy), rule them instead. Rudolf returned to Upper Burgundy to protect himself, assuring Hugh's coronation as King of Italy in the process. The Italians then switched sides again, declaring that they wished for Rudolf to reclaim the throne. To prevent this, Hugh and Rudolf signed a treaty in 933, granting Rudolf rule of Lower Burgundy in exchange for his renunciation of all claims on the Italian throne. The two Burgundian kingdoms unified, Rudolf ruled until his death in 937. He was succeeded by Conrad.<br />

"Henry Dowe was the parish clerk at Runham. In his will dated 9 December 1612 (ANW 1612/3, 198 Dewpleet)[?], Henry Dowe gave to Elizabeth his wife the use of all his messuages, houses, lands, tenements, which had been given to him by his father Thomas Dowe. After her death his son Thomas was to inherit the property, paying to his sisters Mary and Frances 10 pounds each. He named his sons Henry and Edward and appointed his brother-in-law William Marche supervisor to aid his wife who was to be executrix.<br />
An inquisition was taken at Watton, Norfolk, 19 April 1614 'after the death of Henry Dowe, who had died seized of a close of arable land called le Wenge close in Runham containing by estimation 14 Acres held of the King, of the annual value of 13s, 4d... on messuage and 11 acres of land in Runham and Maultbye and Thrigby held of Thomas Perney, knight of his manor of Strumpsall... at the time of his death his son and heir was Thomas Dowe a minor aged 13 years and 3 months' (PRO, Chancery Inquisitions Post Mortem, Series II, 344, no. 94)."<br />

      Burpee was a bit of a nomad and traveled several times back andforth from Massachusetts and Ross Corner, Nova Scotia. He was a laborerand farm worker. He developed diabetes late in life necessatating theprogressive amputation of his legs.<br />
      Based on conversations with his daughter Irene, we know that Burpee was a very stern disiciplinarian. He would not let his wife and children enjoy a social life outside their home nor engage in certain activities (e.g. playing cards) in the home. He had a harsh temper but "never raised a hand" against his wife or children. They lived "up on the mountain" so seldom went to church down in Kentville.<br />
      He was not a successful farmer and probably lost his farm to creditors or simply walked away from it when he moved his family for the last time to Massachusetts. He worked for other farmers in Westborough and Southboro and was eventually able to purchase a farm of his own in Northboro. However, the hurricane of 1938 swept through the area and desimated the farm. Irene recalled her father having to crawl on his hands and knees to get from the barn to the house in the high winds. He was unable to recover the economic setback and lost the farm to the bank.<br />
      Irene reverred her mother as a saint and blames her father for exposing his wife to a harsh and difficult life. She struggled to feed her family and Irene has specific recollections of Rebecca feeding all the farm hands at lunchtime.<br />

Boso was a Frankish noblemen, related to the Carolingian dynasty, and rose to be King of Provence.<br />
 <br />
Boso was the son of Biwin, a count in Lotharingia. His aunt Theutberga was the wife of the Emperor Lothar II. Boso also was a nephew of the Italian count Boso, from which Boso derived his name, and of Hugbert, lay abbot of St. Maurice dʼAgaune, which he succeeded as lay abbot in 869.<br />
 <br />
In 870 Charles the Bald, King of Western Francia, married Boso's sister Richilde. This marriage paved the way for Boso's career in the service of his royal brother-in-law. In the same year, Bosos was appointed count of Lyons and Vienne, replacing Gerard of Rousillon, and in 872 Charles appointed him chamberlain and magister ostiariorum to Charles' young son Louis the Stammerer and also count of Bourges. Louis ruled as a subordinate king of Aquitaine, but because of his youth, it was Boso who took care of the administration of that realm.<br />
 <br />
In autumn of 875 he accompanied Charles on his first Italian campaign and at the diet of Pavia in February 876 he was appointed arch-minister and missus for Italy and elevated to the honour of a duke. He probably had also been charged with the administration of the Provence. Boso acted as a viceroy and increased his prestige even more by marrying Ermengarde, the only daughter of Emperor Louis II.<br />
 <br />
He however disapproved of Charles' second Italian campaign in 877 and and conspired with other, like-minded nobles against his king. After Charles's death in October 877 these nobles forced Charles's son Louis the Stammerer to confirm their rights and privileges.<br />
 <br />
Boso also formed close relations to the Papacy and in September 878 he accompanied Pope John VIII to Troyes, where the Pope asked king Louis the Stammerer for his support in Italy. The Pope adopted Boso as his son and probably offered to crown Louis Emperor.<br />
 <br />
In April 879 king Louis the Stammerer died, leaving behind two adult sons, Louis and Carloman. Boso joined with other western Frankish nobles and advocated making Louis the sole heir of the western kingdom, but eventually both brothers were elected kings.<br />
 <br />
Boso, claiming reasons of legitimacy, however renounced allegiance to both brothers and in July claimed independence ("Boso Dei gratia id quod sum"). He also claimed that his father-in-law Louis II had named him as his heir. On 15 October, 879 the bishops and nobles of the region around the rivers Rhone and Saone assembled at Mantaille elected Boso king as successor to Louis the Stammerer. This event marks the first occurence of a "free election", without regard to royal descent, inspired by principles of ecclesiastical elections.<br />
 <br />
Boso's realm, usually called Kingdom of Provence comprised the church province Arles, Aix, Vienne, Lyons (without Langres), probably Besancon, as well as the dioceses Tarentaise, Uzes und Viviers.<br />
 <br />
After Louis and Carloman had divided their father's realm at Amiens in March 880, the two brothers marched against Boso, took Macon and the northern parts of Boso's realm. They united their forces with those of Charles the Fat and unsuccesfully besieged Vienne from August to November.<br />
 <br />
In August 882 Boso was again besieged at Vienne by his relative Richard, Count of Autun, who took the city in September.<br />
 <br />
After this, Boso could not regain most of his realm and was restricted to the vicinity of Vienne.<br />
 <br />
He died in 887 and was succeeded by his son Louis.<br />

Weis' "Ancestral Roots. . ." (139:25). Note that this individual has beenfor centuries confused, even by Cokayne, with another William of EU (RIN8776*). The relationship between the two Williams, if any, has not beendetermined. See the following notes for more details. Per Cockayne's"Complete Peerage" (EU, pp. 153-154), he was Count of Eu and Lord ofHastings and held extensive estates. In 1088 he took a prominent place inthe rebellion against King William Rufus in favor of Duke Robert ofNormandy, invading Gloucestershire and destroying the town of Berkely. In903 Rufus won him back to his side by bribes and promises, but in 1095William participated in Mowbray's plot to kill King William and place[Eudes (RIN 1820)] the disinherited Count of Champagne on the throne inhis place. [Traditionally it has been said that] at the Council ofSalisbury in 1095/6 William was charged with treason, and having beenvanquished in single combat by his accuser, was condemned to be blindedand (at the insistence of [his brother-in-law] Hugh of Avranches, Earl ofChester (RIN 3101)) emasculated. [However, see a later note refutingthis.] Nothing further is known about him, and he must have died then orsoon afterwards. "Genealogy of the Dutton family Pennsylvania" compiledby Gilbert Cope, printed in 1871, reports that, according to "Burke'sLanded Gentry, p. 1508, William and his second wife (whom Cope callsJeanne rather than HELISINDE) were parents of six sons. One of these sonswas ODARD OF DUTTON (RIN 5274), who was the ancestor of all Duttons inEngland. The Cokayne article cited above, however, mentions no childrenborn to Willam by the niece of Hugh of Avranches, Earl of Chester -bywhatever name we choose to call her. UTZ@@aol.com [Dave Utzinger] postedto GEN-MEDIEVAL-L@@rootsweb.com on 10 Jan 1999 Subject: HENRY II, COUNT OFEU--PART 3" . "Notes for William II, Count of Eu:<br />
Succeeded on his father's death in 1090 to his English Barony and Norman County of Eu. The occupation of Eu by an English garrison was an act of treason to the Duke of Normandy, but Count William became within a few months the subject de jure as well as de facto of the King of England, for on Candlemas day 1091 William Rufus crossed over with a large fleet, and before the end of February a treaty was concluded, by which the County of Eu was ceded to the English King. Three years afterwards the war between Duke Robert and his brother was renewed, and at Mid Lent 1094 King William crossed over again from Hastings, and fixed his head-quarters at EU. But Robert engaged the assistance of the French King, and William Rufus would have been besieged at Eu by their united forces whilst he was waiting for reinforcements, unless he had tricked King Philip into deserting his brother's cause. .<br />
According to all the received pedigrees the Count of Eu was in 1095 one of the leaders in the conspiracy to put Stephen Count of Aumale on the throne of England, for French and English genealogists are agreed in identifying him with William of Eu, who was cruelly mutilated at Salisbury in January 1096 for his treason . This agreement is the more remarkable, because William of Eu's cruel punishment is mentioned in every chronicle of the period, and they all without exception avoid describing the sufferer as the Count of Eu: whilst all that is known about him suggests that he and the Count of Eu were two different and distinct persons. The Count of Eu, and William of Eu are separately registered in Domesday, which gives no hint of any connection or relationship between them. Domesday suggests that William succeeded his own mother and Ralph de Limesi in the ownership of some 77 manors in the Western and South-Western Counties, which for the most part belonged in the time of Edward the Confessor to Alestan of Boscombe in Wiltshire. They were scattered over nine counties and were valued at L401 per annum. They formed therefore a Barony of great importance, for there were scarcely 20 lay fiefs in the kingdom which were of greater value. They were afterwards known collectively as the Honour of Strigul, for the Castle of Strigul or (as it was afterwards called) Chepstow was the head of this Barony, which passed in its entirety after William's forfeiture, by the grant of William Rufus, to Walter a younger son of Richard de Clare, who was the son of Count Gilbert of Eu of the elder line. It must be suspected that this grant to Walter was earned by Gilbert's timely denunciation of his accomplices, amongst whom William of Eu was Conspicuous. And if Walter was (as is likely) William's cousin through their common descent from the disinherited Count Gilbert of Eu, it was in strict accordance with the settled policy of this period, that the estates forfeited by William of Eu should be transferred to a more loyal kinsman. Walter transmitted these estates to his heirs, and it is certain that no claim was ever made to them by Count William's son Count Henry of Eu, although be was in high favour with King Henry I. and inherited without question the Domesday Barony of the Count of Eu, which must have been forfeited with the rest, if the traitor of 1096 was the Count. . Again, I cannot believe that William of Eu's steward William de Alderie, who suffered with him at Salisbury and was the son of his maternal aunt, was the nephew of Beatrix Countess of Eu. Moreover, it is quite certain that William of Eu's wife, who was the Earl of Chester's sister, and whose jealousy was fatal to her husband, was not the wife of William Count of Eu , for it was judicially proved in 1220 that the mother of Count William's son and successor (Count Henry) was the daughter of Roger de Busli the Domesday Baron of Tickhill in Yorkshire. It is marvellous that in the face of such evidence the sufferer of 1096 was ever mistaken for the Count of Eu, and that this mistaken identity has been unsuspectingly repeated by every genealogist English and French from Dugdale and Pere Anselm to Planche and Freeman. It was never in fact called in question until 1878, when the late Mr. Eyton inferred from the antecedents of William of Eu's estate in Dorset, that be had been "erroneously identified with the Count of Eu."<br />
This mistake has been a fruitful parent of error and confusion in the pedigree, for as William of Eu's wife was beyond all doubt sister of the Earl of Chester, the heiress of Tickbill had to be pushed back to the preceding generation, although it was distinctly proved in the law suit of 1220, that she was the mother of Count Henry of Eu. This error led to another, because it was chronologically impossible that Beatrix Countess of Eu, who was married long before the Conquest could be the daughter of Roger de Busli of Domesday. It was therefore assumed that Beatrix was Roger's sister, although in that case her descendant's title to the Barony would have been inferior to that of her opponent, who was the heir beyond all question of Roger de Busli's brother.<br />
All that the French genealogists can tell us about Count William II beyond the names of his parents and his children is an anecdote recorded by Guibert de Nogent, who tells us that the Count was at Rouen in 1096, after the first Crusade was proclaimed, when he rescued from the fury of the mob a Jew boy, who was educated as a Christian at the expense of his rescuer and died a nionk at the Abbey of St. Germes. The Crusade decreed at the Council of Clermont in November 1095 was proclaimed at Rouen in February 1096, so that this story, which Guibert heard from the lips of the Countess herself, is irreconcilable with the statement that the Count was mutilated in prison in England in January 1096.<br />
Count William II. died before 1100, and had issue by his wife Beatrix the daughter of Roger de Busli of Domesday and sister and heir of Roger de Busli . four sons.<br />
i. Henry I, Count of Eu, married Margaret de Sulli.<br />
ii. William de Eu. Fought gallantly in the army of Henry I, at the battle of Bourgteroude in Lent 1124, when he took Almaric de Montfort prisoner. But William was as generous as he was brave, and he knew the relentless and unforgiving character of the English King. He refused therefore to be the means of consigning Almaric to hopeless captivity for the rest of his life, and preferred to sacrifice his own prospects and career. Accordingly he released his prisoner, and accompanied him into exile, where he entered into the service of the French King and was lost henceforth to Normandy.<br />
iii. Robert de Eu.<br />
iv. Enguerrand de Eu." He is placed in the next generation by the French<br />
genealogists, who call him the fourth son of Count Henry; but this is disproved by chronological considerations, and by the express statement of the contemporary chronicler that Count Henry of Eu had only three sons.<br />

Emma (c. 988-March 6, 1052), daughter of Richard I, Duke of Normandy, by his second wife Gunnora, was twice queen of England, by marriage first (1002-1016) to king Ethelred the Unready and then (1017-1035) to Canute, king also of Denmark and Norway. Two of her sons - one by each husband - and two step-sons also became king of England, as did her great-nephew, William the Conqueror.<br />
 <br />
Upon the Danish invasion of England in 1013, Emma took her sons by Ethelred - Alfred and Edward - to Normandy, where they remained upon her return to England to marry Canute, now king of England following the death of Ethelred and his son (her step-son) Edmund Ironside.<br />
 <br />
Following Canute's death, Alfred and Edward returned in 1036, possibly in an attempt to overthrow Canute's illegitimate son Harold Harefoot, who had established himself as ruler in the absence of Harthacanute, son of Canute and Emma. Alfred was captured and died after being blinded, while Edward escaped to Normandy, followed by his mother.<br />
 <br />
The death of Harold in 1040 and the accession of the more conciliatory Harthacanute paved the way for Edward's return to England the next year as co-ruler and (1042) king on Harthacanute's death. Emma returned to end her days at Winchester, Hampshire, where she was buried alongside Canute.<br />
 <br />
Emma's marriages and subsequent role forged the link between England and Normandy which was to culminate in her great-nephew William of Normandy's invasion of England in 1066.<br />

From Wikipedia<br />
 <br />
William III of Montferrat (it. Guglielmo) (c. 1115-1191), also known as William the Old to distinguish him from his eldest son, William Longsword, was marquess of Montferrat from c. 1136 to his death in 1191. William was the only son of marquess Renier I and his wife Gisela, a daughter of William I, Count of Burgundy. It seems likely, given that he was still fit enough to participate in battle in 1187, that William was one of his parents' youngest children. He was described by Otto Morena as of medium height and compact build, with a round, somewhat ruddy face and hair so fair as to be almost white. He was talkative, intelligent and good-humoured, generous but not extravagant.<br />
 <br />
He served honourably in the Second Crusade, alongside his nephew Louis VII of France. (Louis was only several years younger than William, but his mother Adelasia of Moriana was William's half-sister, through his mother Gisela's first marriage to Count Humbert of Savoy).<br />
 <br />
William married Judith or Julitta von Babenberg, daughter of Leopold III of Austria, sometime before March 28, 1133. It is likely that Judith was still very young at the time: none of their children seem to have been born before 1140, and the youngest son in 1162. She died after 1168. They had five sons, four of whom became prominent in the affairs of the Kingdom of Jerusalem and of Byzantium:<br />
    * William Longsword, Count of Jaffa and Ascalon, father of Baldwin V of Jerusalem<br />
    * Conrad, King of Jerusalem<br />
    * Boniface, his successor to Montferrat and founder of the Kingdom of Thessalonica<br />
    * Frederick or Otto, who entered the Church, and may have been Bishop of Alba (although Usseglio notes there are difficulties in identifying him firmly)<br />
    * Renier, married into the Byzantine imperial family<br />
and three daughters:<br />
    * Adelasia or Azalais, who married Manfredo II, marquess of Saluzzo<br />
    * Agnes, who married Count Guido Guerra of Tuscany. The marriage was annulled before 1180, when Guido remarried, and Agnes seems to have entered a convent.<br />
    * An unidentified daughter, who married Alberto, marquess of Malaspina.<br />
 <br />
As as traditional supporter of the Ghibellines, William and his sons fought with the Emperor Frederick Barbarossa in his struggle with the Lombard League. Following Barbarossa's capitulation with the Peace of Venice in 1177, William was left to deal with the rebellious towns in the area alone. Meanwhile, the Byzantine emperor Manuel I Comnenus sought support for his own politics in Italy. In 1179 he suggested a marriage between his daughter Maria, second in line to the throne, and a son of William the Old. As the youngest son, Renier was the only one then unmarried, he was married off to the princess, who was thirteen years his senior.<br />
 <br />
In 1183, with the accession of his grandson Baldwin V, a minor, as co-King of Jerusalem, William, then probably in his late sixties, left the government of Montferrat to his third son, Boniface, and returned to the east. He was granted the castle of St. Elias (present-day El Taiyiba). He fought in the Battle of Hattin in 1187, where he was captured by Saladin's forces. In the meantime, his second son, Conrad, had arrived at Tyre from Constantinople. Conrad was given the command of the defences, and is said to have refused to surrender as much as a stone of its walls to liberate his father, even threatening to shoot him with a crossbow himself when Saladin had him presented as a hostage. Eventually, William was released unharmed, and Saladin withdrew his army from Tyre. He seems to have ended his days there, with his son.<br />

 <br />
From James Baldwin Parker, 19 October 2002<br />
 <br />
William Warren Chamberlain, b. 13 Feb 1873, Honolulu, Hawaii, m. Clio Newton there, 21 Feb, 1906, with three children listed for them: Warren Levi, Clio Olivia, and Althea Mabel. I don't have any more data for him or his children, but if he lived in Maui after his marriage, you should be able to locate him there in the 1910 Census. His ancestors did indeed live in Maui. William is one of 5 children of Warren Chamberlain, who married Celia Penninah Wright, 2 Apr 1854. Warren was born 17 Jul 1829, Kawaiaho, Hawaii, and died 8 Dec 1914; Celia was born 12 May 1831 and died 1 Feb 1907. My records indicate that Warren Chamberlain was member #212 of the original Chamberlain Association of America. His letter, dated 15 Aug 1901, from Honolulu, was sent to the CAA and was published in its 1902 Annual Report, pp. 11-12, telling of his activities. CAA arcives indicate that Warren's father, Levi Chamberlain, with a small group from Maine, including Chamberlains and Whitneys, went to Hawaii and founded a missionary school there. Levi was married 1 Sep 1818 in Lahaini, Maui, Hawaii, and died there 29 Jul 1849.  Ancestral line of descent: Levi(6), Joseph(5), Willson(4), John(3), Jacob(2), William(1) Chamberlain of Billerica, MA.<br />
-----------------------------------<br />
WILLIAM WARREN CHAMBERLAIN, Trustee and Financier. Born of pioneer missionary stock, a grandson of Levi Chamberlain, who came to Hawaii in 1823 with the second company of missionaries sent out by the American Board and who for many years was superintendent of secular affairs for the Board, William W. Chamberlain, financier, trustee and a director of some of the larger corporations in Hawaii, has always maintained a deep interest in welfare work.  His father, Warren Chamberlain, was one of the first sugar cane planters at Waialua, Oahu.<br />
Besides acting as trustee and financial agent of various business enterprises, Mr. Chamberlain has been a trustee of Oahu College since 1914 and is now treasurer of that institution. He is the treasurer of the Hawaiian Mission Childrenʼs Society, a member of the Chamber of Commerce committee on Charities and Social Welfare, and as a member of the advisory board of the Salvation Army had much to do with the building of the Salvation Army Boysʼ and Girlsʼ homes.<br />
 <br />
Mr. Chamberlain served the Territory as a member of the house of representatives at the 1925 session of the Hawaiian legislature, this being his first public office.<br />
After completing his course at Oahu College, Mr. Chamberlain received the business training, which fitted him for his career in Honolulu in the Bryant and Stratton Business College in Chicago. Returning to Honolulu he engaged in various commercial lines, being associated with the Hawaiian Gazette Co. in 1895, the Honolulu post office in 1898, the Bank of Hawaii in 1899 and the Kahului Railroad Co. and Paia Plantation Co. in 1900, in which year he joined W. O. Smith, then actively engaged with a large private law practice. Mr. Smith had a rapidly expanding trust business, which was entrusted to the manager-ship of Mr. Chamberlain until 1911, when it was incorporated as the Guardian Trust Co., Ltd., and Mr. Chamberlain was named manager. In 1920 this trust company was amalgamated with the Bishop Trust Co., Ltd., and since that time Mr. Chamberlain has been a director and a member of the executive committee of the latter corporation.<br />
 In 1917 he became one of the trustees of the B. M. Allen Trust Estate, and he is vice-president of Allen & Robinson, Ltd., and a director of the Oahu Railway & Land Co., Honolulu Rapid Transit Co., McBryde Sugar Co., the Guardian Building & Loan Association and other corporations.<br />
Mr. Chamberlain served from 1895 to 1897 in Company B of the Honolulu Rifles, during the unsettled period following the Revolution, and as a lieutenant of the Mounted Reserve prior to annexation. He holds memberships in the Commercial Club, Honolulu Chamber of Commerce, Hawaiian Historical Society, Honolulu Ad Club, is a life member of the Queenʼs Hospital Corporation and a member of the Native Sons of Hawaii.<br />
He was born in Honolulu, Feb. 13, 1873, the son of Warren and Celia P. (Wright) Chamberlain. In 1906 Mr. Chamberlain married Clio Newton of Honolulu, and they have three children, Warren Levi, Clio Olivia, and Allethea Mabel Chamberlain.<br />

William Fitz Robert, 2nd Earl of Gloucester (died 1183) was the son andheir of Sir Robert de Caen, 1st Earl of Gloucester, and Mabel ofGloucester, daughter of Robert Fitzhamon. His father was an illegitimateson of King Henry I of England, thusly William was a nephew of theEmpress Maud and a cousin of King Stephen, the principal combatants ofthe English Anarchy period.<br />
 <br />
In October 1141, William looked after the baronial estates, when his father fell into the hands of partisans at Winchester. His father was exchanged for King Stephen, and during his father's absence in Normandy in 1144 he served as Governor of Wareham. In 1147, he overthrew Henry de Tracy at Castle Cary. In 1154 he made an alliance with Roger de Clare, 3rd Earl of Hertford, by which they agreed to aid each other against all men except Henry II of England. He was lord of the manor of Glamorgan, as well as Caerleon, residing chiefly at Cardiff. It was there that in 1158 he and his wife and son were captured by Ivor the Little and carried away into the woods, where they were held as prisoners until the Earl redressed Ivor's grievances. In 1173 he took the King's part against his sons, but thereafter he appears to have fallen under suspicion, for the following year he submitted to the King, and in 1175 surrendered to him Bristol Castle. Because his only son and heir Robert died in 1166, Earl William made John, the younger son of King Henry II, heir to his earldom, in conformity with the King's promise that John should marry one of the Earl's daughters, if the Church would allow it, they being related in the third degree. Earl William was present in March 1177 when the King arbitrated between the Kings of Castile and Navarre, and in 1178, he witnessed Henry's charter to Waltham Abbey. But during the King's struggles with his sons, when he imprisoned a number of magnates of whose loyalty he was doubtful, Earl William was among them. He died on his birthday in 1183; his wife Hawise survived him.<br />
 <br />
Since Earl William and Hawise's only son, Robert, predeceased his father, their three daughters became coheirs to the Gloucester inheritance. Mabel of Gloucester married Amaury V de Montfort, the Count of Evreux. Amice of Gloucester married Richard de Clare, 4th Earl of Hertford. Isabel, who became Countess of Gloucester, married Prince John, Earl of Gloucester, prior to him becoming king. He never allowed her to be crowned queen, and finally divorced her.<br />

Per a book written by Eunice Miena Barber:<br />
Samuel, son of Deacon Samuel & his wife Margaret Unknown, born about 1629; was one of the petitioners to the General Court for the First Settlement of Northfield, then known as Squakheag, 5/31/1671. He was a resident of Northampton, Mass., at this time. The first petition was refused & another one was sent the next spring signed by 23 men including Samuel Wright Senior. This petition was granted & he was one of the sixteen heads of families who took house-lots & settled there. His lot was on the west side of the street "which they or their heirs had in the second settlement".<br />
The Indians continued friendly until spring of 1675. Brookfield was destroyed in August of that Year. (King Philip's War). A squad of twenty soldiers was sent by Major Pynchon to garrison Northfield who were put under command of Sergeant Samuel Wright. A battle between Hatfield Indians & Captains _____ & Beers was fought in town of Whately August 25. Sept 1st the Indians fell upon Deerfield & Thursday, Sept 2d, on Northfield. It was the season of drying flax; & ignorant of what had happened the day before to their neighbors at Deerfield, the people of Northfield went about their work as usual on that morning. The soldiers & settlers appeared to have been scattered in the meadow & house-lots when the assault was made. According to Rev. Mr. Hubbard "some were killed in their homes, others as they were coming out of the meadows, the rest: men, women, & children fled to their fort, unable to rally out & repel the enemy. The savages kept around them, killed many of their cattle, destroyed their grain (wheat which was harvested & in the stook) burnt the houses that were outside the stockade & laid all waste. The number of whites officially reported as killed was eight & one was Sgt. Samuel Wright.<br />
After another attack by the Indians on 9/4 the Squakheag families having thus been driven from their new homes returned to their old homes in Hadley & Northampton.<br />
In the second settlement of Squakheag or Northfield in 1685 to 90, Samuel Wright's heirs were assigned 60 acres. The homestead of this Samuel Wright who went to Northampton with his father had continued in his line from 1657 until the compilation of the New England Historical & Genealogical Register in 1886.<br />
He married, 11/24/1653, Elizabeth, daughter of Henry Burt who was a companion of Deacon Samuel Wright in the settlement of Springfield. She survived him & married 2d, 9/26/1684, Nathaniel Dickinson of Hatfield.<br />

The Historical Society Museum is located at 55 Cayuga Street in SenecaFalls, NY in a house with a long and varied history. The first structurewas built in 1823 as a one room wooden house. Edward Mynderse , son ofthe early land developer Colonel Wilhelmus Mynderse , erected a two-storybrick structure in the Italianate Style circa 1855 on the site. Thebuilding was part of a ten acre estate with carriage house, tool shed,vineyard, garden and orchard. The Mynderse Family lived there until 1875when Mrs. Leroy Partridge purchased the house and began an extensiveremodeling and updating that changed the two story dwelling into thethree stories,23 room, Queen Anne Style home that you see today.Architectural and decorative details which were added , include paintedand stained glass windows, gas lights, carved fireplaces and the entirethird floor. The mansion was sold to the Norman Becker Family in 1890 ,which raised six children in the house. The Beckers lived there until1961, when the Historical Society bought the building.

Stephen Hopkins was from Hampshire, England.  He married his first wife,Mary, and in the parish of Hursley, Hampshire; he and wife Mary had theirchildren Elizabeth, Constance, and Giles all baptized there.  It has longbeen claimed that the Hopkins family was from Wortley, Gloucester, butthis was disproven in 1998.  For more information on the true Englishorigins of Stephen Hopkins, see the "Published Research" section at thebottom of this page.<br />
 <br />
Stephen Hopkins went with the ship Sea Venture on a voyage to Jamestown, Virginia in 1609 as a minister's clerk, but the ship wrecked in the "Isle of Devils" in the Bermudas.  Stranded on an island for ten months, the passengers and crew survived on turtles, birds, and wild pigs.  Six months into the castaway, Stephen Hopkins and several others organized a mutiny against the current governor.  The mutiny was discovered and Stephen was sentenced to death.  However, he pleaded with sorrow and tears.  "So penitent he was, and made so much moan, alleging the ruin of his wife and children in this his trespass, as it wrought in the hearts of all the better sorts of the company".  He managed to get his sentence commuted.<br />
 <br />
Eventually the castaways built a small ship and sailed themselves to Jamestown.  How long Stephen remained in Jamestown is not known. However, while he was gone, his wife Mary died.  She was buried in Hursley on 9 May 1613, and left behind a probate estate which mentions her children Elizabeth, Constance and Giles.<br />
 <br />
Stephen was back in England by 1617, when he married Elizabeth Fisher, but apparently had every intention of bringing his family back to Virginia.  Their first child, Damaris, was born about 1618.  In 1620, Stephen Hopkins brought his wife, and children Constance, Giles, and Damaris on the Mayflower (child Elizabeth apparently had died).  Stephen was a fairly active member of the Pilgrims shortly after arrival, perhaps a result of his being one of the few individuals who had been to Virginia previously.  He was a part of all the early exploring missions, and was used almost as an "expert" on Native Americans for the first few contacts.  While out exploring, Stephen recognized and identified an Indian deer trap.  And when Samoset walked into Plymouth and welcomed the English, he was housed in Stephen Hopkins' house for the night.  Stephen was also sent on several of the ambassadorial missions to meet with the various Indian groups in the region.<br />
 <br />
Stephen was an assistant to the governor through 1636, and volunteered for the Pequot War of 1637 but was never called to serve.  By the late 1630s, however, Stephen began to occasionally run afoul of the Plymouth authorities, as he apparently opened up a shop and served alcohol.  In 1636 he got into a fight with John Tisdale and seriously wounded him.  In 1637, he was fined for allowing drinking and shuffleboard playing on Sunday.  Early the next year he was fined for allowing people to drink excessively in his house: guest William Reynolds was fined, but the others were acquitted.  In 1638 he was twice fined for selling beer at twice the actual value, and in 1639 he was fined for selling a looking glass for twice what it would cost if bought in the Bay Colony.  Also in 1638, Stephen Hopkins' maidservant got pregnant from Arthur Peach, who was subsequently executed for murdering an Indian.  The Plymouth Court ruled he was financially responsible for her and her child for the next two years (the amount remaining on her term of service).  Stephen, in contempt of court, threw Dorothy out of his household and refused to provide for her, so the court committed him to custody.  John Holmes stepped in and purchased Dorothy's remaining two years of service from him: agreeing to support her and child.<br />
 <br />
Stephen died in 1644, and made out a will, asking to be buried near his wife, and naming his surviving children.<br />

Giles Hopkins was baptized on 30 January 1607/8 in Hursley, Hampshire,England, to parents Stephen Hopkins and his first wife Mary.  It shouldbe noted that the long-standing Constance Dudley myth was disproven in1998: the Hopkins family of the Mayflower was not from Wortley,Gloucester as had been previously speculated and published.<br />
 <br />
Giles came with his father Stephen, step-mother Elizabeth, sister Constance, and step-sister Damaris on the Mayflower in 1620, at the age of 12.  He volunteered for service in the 1637 Pequot War but was not called.  He married Catherine Wheldon in 1639 at Plymouth; the family moved shortly thereafter to Yarmouth, living there for about five years before moving on to settle at Eastham, where he died sometime between 1688 and 1690.<br />

From Wikipedia<br />
 <br />
Theodebert I (French Thibert I or Théodebert I), (circa 500 - 547 or 548), Merovingian king of Austrasia from 533 - 548, residence: Reims, now in northeast France.<br />
 <br />
Son of Frankish king Theuderich I. Married in 533 Deuteria, a Gallo-Roman. Later abandoned Deuteria to marry Wisigarda (daughter of Wacho, king of the Langobards). Children: Theudebald (533/535 - 555), Berthoara.<br />
 <br />
In the year 532 Theodebert completed, together with Gunthar (son of Chlothar I) the reconquest of territories held by his grandfather Clovis I, which had been taken by Goths following Clovis's death. After the death of Theuderich at the end of 533, Theodebert inherited his father's possessions, prevailing against the claims of his uncles Childebert I and Chlothar. The childless Childebert then allied himself with his newphew, and split with him the inheritance of Chlodomer's lands in Burgundy. Soon afterward, he adopted Theodebert.<br />
 <br />
The Merovingian kings then joined to fight the Ostrogoths. Allying himself with the Gepids and the Langobards (wedding their king's daughter Wisigarda), Theodebert won the northern provinces as well as Raetien. Large parts of Venice were taken in 545, but Theodebert's party avoided a confrontation with the Byzantine Emperor.<br />
 <br />
Theodebert displayed both the gifts of his family and its flaws: high statesmanship and unruly sensualism, unthinking lust for power mixed with intelligent power politics and perfidiousness. He celebrated his coronation with the striking of gold coins with his own picture and the staging of circus performances in Arles.<br />
 <br />
Theodebert died in the 14th year of his reign (at the end of 547 or the beginning of 548) and his son Theudebald succeeded him.<br />

Halfdan the Black Gudrødsson (820 - 860) (Old Norse: Hálfdan svarti,Norwegian: Halvdan Svarte) was the father of the first King of NorwayHarald I and of the House of Yngling.<br />
 <br />
His father was King Gudröd the Hunter, and his brother Olaf Geirstad-Alf.<br />
 <br />
The saga of Halfdan the Black tells the following story:<br />
 <br />
Halfdan's mother was named Åsa. She was the daughter of King Harald of Agder. When Halfdan's father was killed, Åsa took the year-old Halfdan and returned to Agder, where Halfdan grew up.<br />
 <br />
In 838, when he was eighteen years old, Halfdan became king of Agder. He quickly began adding to his kingdom through political negotiation and military conquest. He divided the kingdom of Vestfold with his brother Olaf and, through military action, persuaded King Gandalf of Vingulmark to cede half his kingdom.<br />
 <br />
Next, Halfdan subdued an area called Raumarike. To secure his claim to Raumarike, Halfdan first defeated and killed Sigtryg, the previous ruler, in battle, then defeated Sigtryg's brother and successor Eystein in a series of battles. This established Halfdan's claim not only to Raumarike, but also to half of Hedemark, Sigtryg and Eystein's core kingdom.<br />
 <br />
Halfdan first wife was Ragnhild, daughter of King Harald Gulskeg (Goldbeard) of Sogn. Halfdan and Ragnhild had a son named Harald after his grandfather, and they sent him to be raised in his grandfather's court. Harald Gulskeg, being elderly, named his grandson as his successor shortly before his death. Ragnhild died shortly after her father and the young king Harald fell sick and died the next spring. When he heard about his son's death, Halfdan traveled to Sogn and laid claim to the title of king. No resistance was offered and Halfdan added Sogn to his realm.<br />
 <br />
The sons of Gandalf of Vingulmark, Hysing, Helsing, and Hake, attempted to ambush Halfdan at night but he escaped into the forest. After raising an army, he returned and defeated the brothers, killing Hysing and Helsing. Hake fled from the country and Halfdan became king of all of Vingulmark.<br />
 <br />
Halfdan's second wife was also named Ragnhild. She was the daughter of Sigurd Hjort, king of Ringerike. She was kidnapped from her home by Hake, a berserker who encountered her father in Hadeland and killed him. In turn, Halfdan had her kidnapped from Hake so that he could marry her. Ragnhild and Halfdan had a son who was also named Harald.<br />
 <br />
Halfdan died when he fell through the ice of a lake that had been weakened by cattle dung after a hole was cut in the ice for the cattle to drink. Each of the districts of his kingdom wanted to claim his grave. In the end, it was agreed to divide his body into four pieces so each district could bury a piece of it, resulting in Halfdan's Mounds.<br />

GEORGE MURRAY GUION.<br />
Colonel United States Volunteers. Died at Colorado Springs, Colorado, November 9, 1910.<br />
Again we are called to record the passing of one of our best loved companions. The records of the Civil War contain few names of more worth as a citizen soldier than that of George Murray Guion, who died at Colorado Springs, Colorado, November 9th, 1910.<br />
George Murray Guion, son of the Rev. John Marshall Guion, S. T. D., was born in Meriden, Connecticut, June 28th, 1836. He was a direct descendant of Louis Guion, Huguenot, who settled in America about 1687.<br />
In 1840 he moved with his parents to New Britain, where he lived until 1854. Three years were spent in New Haven and New York, and in 1857, with other members of his father's family, he settled in Seneca Falls, New York, and there engaged in the drug business.<br />
At the outbreak of the Civil War, having organized a company at Seneca Falls, he was mustered as Captain May 9th, 1861, and proceeded with his company to the rendezvous at Elmira, where it became Co. A of the 33rd N. Y.<br />
In July following his regiment was ordered to Washing- ton and assigned to Gen. W. F. Smith's Brigade, which afterwards became the 3rd Brigade 2nd Div. 6th Corps.<br />
He served in the 6th Corps, Army of the Potomac, through the Peninsular and Maryland campaigns in 1862, and in the 18th Corps, Army of the James, during the movement against Richmond, and the siege of Petersburg in 1864.<br />
He also commanded a successful expedition from York- town to Matthews C. H., and Gwynn's Island in 1863. At the battle of Williamsburg his regiment (temporarily as- signed to Hancock) took the lead in the famous charge on the right, and for its action in that engagement was, by special order of Gen. McClellan, authorized to inscribe "Williamsburg" upon its banners, being the first volunteer regiment in the Army of the Potomac thus honored.<br />
In September, 1862, just before the battle of Antietam, he was commissioned Lieut. Colonel of the 148th, but refused to leave his old comrades until the great battle had been fought and the enemy driven back across the Potomac. In this memorable engagement, Capt. Guion was severely wounded.<br />
As Lieut. Colonel he joined his regiment at Norfolk, Va., in Dix's 7th Corps, being assigned to the city defenses and outpost duty. In 1863 he was promoted to the Colonelcy of his regiment, and stationed at Yorktown, remaining there until April, 1864, when the 148th became part of the 2nd Brigade, 2nd Div. of Smith's 18th Corps. He was assigned to the command of this Brigade in August, 1864, and retained the command until he resigned his commission and was honorably discharged Oct. 16th, 1864. As Captain in the 33rd N. Y. he took an active part in the following engagements: Lewinsville, Va., Sept. 11th, 1861; Lee's Mills, April 4th, 1862 ; Siege of Yorktown, April 5th to May 4th ; Williamsburg, May 5th; Mechanicsville, May 24th; Gaines Mills, June 27th; Chickahominy, June 28th; Savage Station, June 29th; White Oak Swamp, June 30th; Malvern Hill, July 1st; Second Bull Run, August 30th; South Mountain, Md., Sept. 14th; Antietam, Sept. 17th.<br />
As Colonel of the 148th N. Y. he was in command of his regiment at Swift Creek, Va., May 9th, 1864; Proctor's Creek, May 14th; Drewry's Bluff, May 15th; Port Walt- hall, May 26th; Cold Harbor, June 3rd; Rowlett's House, June 15th ; Siege of Petersburg, June 15th to Aug. 25th.  As Brigade Commander he was engaged in the attack on Fort Gilmore and the capture of Fort Harrison and the line of works at Chaffin's Farm, near Richmond, and in the repulse of Beauregard's attempt to recapture the fort in September, 1864. Upon his return from the Army he was- appointed by Gov. Seymour Brigadier General in the National Guard of the State of New York.<br />
He was married February 19th, 1863, to Adelaide Cornelia, daughter of Erastus Partridge, a prominent merchant and banker of Seneca Falls, and to them were born two daughters and one son, Adelaide Murray (Mrs. James Platt Hubbell), since deceased, Elizabeth De Lancey (Mrs. Hamilton Garnsey) and LeRoy Partridge.<br />
With his family he came to Chicago in 1891 and was elected a Companion of the First Class of the Military Order of the Loyal Legion of the United States, through the Commandery of the State of Illinois, April 14th, 1892, his insignia number being 9484.<br />
In 1906 he removed to Colorado Springs, Colorado, where he died on November 9th, 1910.  He is survived by his widow, one daughter and his son.<br />
During 1905 and 1906 Colonel Guion was a member of the Library Committee of the Commandery of Illinois, where he endeared himself to his Companions by his gentle manners and accurate knowledge of the records and events of the war.<br />
Upon leaving Chicago for Colorado Springs he enriched the library of the Commandery by generous and valuable contributions from his own collection.<br />
He was indeed a "very perfect gentile knight," in his personality bearing proof that "the bravest are the tenderest, the loving are the daring."<br />

T.D. was conferred by Columbia College in 1865.<br />
------------------------------------------<br />
From the History of Seneca County New York, 1876<br />
The Rev. Doctor John M. GUION, has supplied a valuable lesson not only to those of like profession but to society in general.  John Marshall Guion, son of Elijah Guion, was born in New York City, on February 22, 1801.  He is descended from those Huguenots of France who were so inflexible for religious right and illustrious for their nobility of character.  His ancestors emigrated from France and settled at New Rochelle, in 1689.<br />
Dr. Guion entered Columbia College in 1822, and four years later, having graduated, immediately began a course of theological study at the New York Theological Seminary, which course was completed in 1829.  These seven years were devoted to one object, the sacred ministry, and during the same season in which his preparation was completed, he was ordained deacon, and immediately took charge of the parish at Palmyra, in this State.  Having been advanced to the priesthood in 1830, he took charge of St. Mark's Church in the city of New York, remaining there until 1832, when his marriage to Elizabeth Ives Wheaton, daughter of John R. Wheaton, of New York, was solemnized.<br />
Removing to Connecticut, the parishes of Saybrook, Meriden, and New Britain were successively placed in his charge, for various periods, up to 1853, when he accepted a call to St. Paul's Church, Baltimore, Maryland, and there remained until the destruction of the church edifice, by fire, during the following year.<br />
In 1855, Dr. Guion came to central New York, having been called to the rectorship of Trinity Church, at Seneca Falls.  For twenty-one years the rector of this parish, he has won the affection of those who have attended his ministrations, and though recently retired from active service, his occasional presence in the pulpit is a source of gratification to those who have known him long only to deepen their regard for his personal merit and consistent teachings.  In 1865 the degree of S. T. D. was conferred by his Alma Mater, Columbia College, an honor most worthily bestowed.  The lesson taught by this brief record is one of quiet, unostentatious perseverance.<br />

From Wikipedia<br />
 <br />
Geoffrey de Mandeville, 1st Earl of Essex (d. 1144) was one of the prominent players during the Anarchy of the reign of King Stephen of England. His biographer, the historian J. H. Round, called him "the most perfect and typical presentment of the feudal and anarchic spirit that stamps the reign of Stephen."<br />
 <br />
He succeeded his father, William sometime before 1130. A key portion of the family patrimony was in the king's hands, as William had incurred Henry I's displeasure and lost them, along with his office as constable of the Tower of London. The king also held the substantial estate of Geoffrey's maternal grandfather Eudo Dapifer.<br />
 <br />
Geoffrey's goal in the early years of strife between Stephen and Maud seems to have to recover these losts lands. He succeeded in this, during the shifting tides of fortunes of the two competitors for the English throne, by bidding his support to first one, then the other.<br />
 <br />
He started out supporting Stephen, who sometime in 1140 (or perhaps December 1139) made him Earl of Essex in reward for his services against Maud. In 1140 or 1141 Stephen returned to him the seized estates in Essex. In 1141 he was also appointed custodian of the Tower of London.<br />
 <br />
After the defeat and capture of Stephen at Lincoln (1141) the earl deserted to Maud. She confirmed his custody of the Tower, forgave the large debts his father had incurred to the crown, granted him the Norman lands of Eduo Dapifer, and appointed him sheriff of Essex, Middlesex and London, and Hertfordshire. But before the end of the year, learning that Stephen's release was imminent, he returned to his original allegiance. In 1142 he was again intriguing with the empress; but before he could openly join her cause he was detected and deprived of his castles by the king.<br />
 <br />
In 1143-1144 Geoffrey maintained himself as a rebel and a bandit in the fen-country, using the Isle of Ely and Ramsey Abbey as his headquarters. He was besieged by Stephen in the fens, and met his death in September 1144 in consequence of a wound received in a skirmish.<br />
 <br />
His career is interesting for two reasons. The charters which he extorted from Stephen and Matilda illustrate the peculiar form taken by the ambitions of English feudatories. The most important concessions are grants of offices and jurisdictions which had the effect of making Mandeville a viceroy with full powers in Essex, Middlesex and London, and Hertfordshire. His career as an outlaw exemplifies the worst excesses of the anarchy which prevailed in some parts of England during the civil wars of 1140-1147, and it is probable that the deeds of Mandeville inspired the rhetorical description, in the Peterborough Chronicle of this period, when "men said openly that Christ and his saints were asleep."<br />
 <br />
Geoffrey married Rohese de Vere, daughter of Aubrey de Vere. They had three sons:<br />
    * Ernulf, who was exiled and disinherited<br />
    * Geoffrey de Mandeville, 2nd Earl of Essex (d. 1166)<br />
    * William de Mandeville, 3rd Earl of Essex (d. 1189)<br />

William de Mandeville (d. sometime between 1105 and 1116) inherited theestates of his father Geoffrey around 1100. He was constable of the Towerof London at that time, and thus keeper of the first person known to beimprisoned there for political reasons, Ranulf Flambard. Flambard'sFebruary 1101 escape would have significant consequences for William.<br />
 <br />
It is not known if William was in some way a confederate of Flambard, or was simply a lax guardian. Either way, king Henry I apparently took away the heart of William's Essex estates. Little is known of William's activities after this.<br />
 <br />
William probably married Margaret, daughter of Eudo Dapifer and Rohese de Clare. Their son Geoffrey would recover the seized estates, and gain much else besides.<br />

Mrs. Eliza Dundas died of typhoid fever, Jan. 15, 1929 at her home inTobacco township. Eliza J. Dow was born June 25, 1872, at her home inTobacco township and was married in 1890 to Jas. Dundas, who died March22, 1922. Mr. and Mrs. Dundas were the parents of seven children, JamesGordon of Detroit, Mrs. Julia Partridge of Toledo, Ohio; Mrs. Hazel Greerof Midland, Mrs. Margaret Raymond of Beaverton, Mrs. Agnes Greer ofGladwin, and Mac and Alma at home, who survive her with 10 grandchildren;her mother, Mrs. Julia F.

Funeral services were held at theAdvent church at Edenville Thursday afternoon, Jan. 17, at 2:30 o'clock, conducted by Rev. Perry Hoover, followed by burial in the Edenville cemetery. Mrs. Dundas was born at the old lumber camp now known as Knox Corners, and was the first white child born in Tobacco township. Mrs. Dundas, her sister, now Mrs. John Rich, and her brother, Jay Dow, now of Toledo, Ohio, were the only three school children in Tobacco township when the district was first organized. They found their way by a trail of trees one half the distance to the school house. The nearest neighbors were nine miles away. All the lumberman of early days stopped here, as it was the only stopping place this side of Edenville. She was always very healthy and had never spent an entire week away from the township in which she was born.<br />
It can well be said of her that she was a true wife, a loving mother, who gave her life for her family. She was a good neighbor who never failed, day or night, when her services were needed. She will be greatly missed in her community. She fought the fights, she kept the faith, Her fame shines bright and clear, And her memory lives in all our hearts, Which will hold it ever dear.<br />

Juggling to thrive: Karen Gilles Larson takes charge<br />
by Judy Woodward<br />
When Karen Gilles Larson (economics '75) started taking classes at the U in 1966, she was a 24-year-old mother with three children under five. It took her nine years to get her degree and another decade before she launched her real career.<br />
As a professional woman, Larson may have been something of a late bloomer, but she certainly has made up for it since. Larson is now the president and CEO of Synovis Life Technologies, a medical device manufacturer that recently celebrated 25 straight profitable quarters and earned itself a slot on the Fortune 100 Fastest Growing Companies and Forbes 200 Best Small Companies lists, and the Russell 2000® Index.<br />
Larson is widely credited for turning around the Minneapolis-based company after a change in Medicare reimbursement policies caused a devastating plunge in demand for the company's main product, the Peri-Strip implantable surgical aid. Under Larson's leadership, the company diversified its product line, developed new markets for the Peri-Strip, and bounced back more profitable than before.<br />
It's a record that any executive would be proud of, and in Larson's case it's all the more remarkable because when she started in the industry she was usually one of the only women in whatever business situation she found herself in.<br />
When she reflects on the far-from-unbroken arc of her career, Larson says, "I am evidence that there is no 'mommy track.' I say to young women, ʻDon't accept the stereotypes. Define your own path.'<br />
Larson began her own path in life most inauspiciously, as the daughter of an absent father and an alcoholic mother. She remembers a lonely Christmas Eve from her early childhood when her mother lay in a stupor on the couch while the holiday cooking smells from the kitchen gradually turned acrid. "The child I was died in that moment," she says, "but survival mechanisms carried me through.<br />
Maybe it was her instinct for survival that propelled her to continue her education. After leaving home at the age of 16, she was able to finish high school with the help of a part-time job and a friend's parents, who gave her a place to live. She started college in La Crosse, Wisc., but soon left to marry and start a family.<br />
Several years later, she was living in Minneapolis when she decided to pursue an interest in investing by taking a few classes at the University. She laughs, "It gave me adults to talk to, because otherwise I was at home with three small children."<br />
From mommy track to fast track<br />
While raising a family-her last child was born in 1972-Larson continued to take classes whenever she could fit them in. In 1975, she graduated with a minor in chemistry in addition to her B.A. in economics. And then, she jokes, "I did what anybody with a chemistry background would do. [With friends] I opened Mes Amies clothing shop on the site of what is now Java Jack's in south Minneapolis.<br />
It wasn't until 1983 that Larson, newly divorced and with her children's college tuition bills looming, decided to enter the corporate world. In a nine-month whirl, she armed herself with an additional degree in accounting from the University of Saint Thomas and then acquired her first "business" job, as an accountant. In April of 1989, she joined what was then called Bio-Vascular, Inc. Less than a decade later, in 1997, she became the head of the company, renamed Synovis Life Technologies.<br />
Although Larson has been praised for her collegial management style, she dismisses the notion that women manage differently. "It's truly an individual thing," she says. She refers to herself as "an equalist" when it comes to personnel decisions. "My only question is ʻCan you do the job?' I respect anyone who respects others.<br />
At the summit of her career, Larson has recently set some new goals for herself. She intends to step down as CEO in two years, when she will be 63. Unlike some retired executives, Larson has no intention of taking things easy. She plans to write two books. One will be on leadership. "The other will be on how to survive a dysfunctional family upbringing," she says. "It's a giftwhy one person is a survivor, but there are things you can do when you are on that journey that can change the path.<br />
With Larson, whether it's juggling family and career, running a company, or writing a book, her response is always the same. "I've always looked around-usually up-and said to myself, I think I can do that.'"<br />

Romanus Lecapenus, co-emperor with Constantine. He was the emperor'sfather-in-law, an able but ruthless Armenian whose whole policy wasdesigned to strengthen his own control and establish that of his family.<br />
 <br />
Emperor Romanus was seized and imprisoned (d. 948) by the very sons whose interests he had attempted to serve. Emperor Constantine became officially the sole ruler, but governed with the aid of the great general Bardas Phocas, and under the influence of Empress Helena and her favorite, Basil.<br />
 <br />
 <br />
From Wikipedia<br />
 <br />
Romanus I Lecapenus (Romanos I Lakapenos, 870 - 948), who shared the throne of the Byzantine Empire with Constantine VII and exercised all the real power from 919 to 944, was admiral of the Byzantine fleet on the Danube River when, hearing of the defeat of the army at the Battle of Anchialus (917), he resolved to sail for Constantinople.<br />
 <br />
After the marriage of his daughter Helena to Constantine he was first proclaimed basileopator ("father of the emperor") in 919 and soon after, crowned colleague of his son-in-law. His reign was uneventful, except for an attempt to check the accumulation of landed property. It was terminated by his own sons, Stephen and Constantine, who in 944 carried him off to the Prince's Islands and compelled him to become a monk. Instead of taking power for themselves, his sons then recognized Constantine VII as sole emperor. Romanus died in 948.<br />

William Witter, the first American ancestor of the Witter family of theUnited States and Canada, was born in England about the year 1584, as hewas seventy-five when he died in 1659. His surname is one of the earliestfound in New England and appears in various forms in the old records ofthis country and of England, -- as Witter, Whitter, Witton, and Whitton.One branch of the Whitter or Witter, family was of Broomehall, in Sussex,England, in the reign of Edward IV. A descendant of this family wasThomas Whitter of Exeter, Devonshire, who was an officer in Cromwell'sarmy. This affiliation with he Parliamentary Party, and hence with thePuritan movement, which contributed largely to the settlement of NewEngland, may indicate a probable connection between the Devonshire familyand the Witters of Early Massachusetts, Connecticut and Rhode Island, ofwhich William Witter was the first American Ancestor.<br />
William was living in Massachusetts as early as 1639, at which date he was probably of Swampscott, near Lynn. At a later period he was a resident of Swampscott, although his i mention in some of the records of Lynn. THe record of this arrival in New England is preserved in an old manuscript, written by his descendant, Samuel Witter, of the sixth generation, entitled: "The Genaligy of the Witters from their first arival fromm England to America, drawn from the Original, March the 20th AD 1773 by Samuel Witter", and the first entry is as follows:<br />
"William Witter in his voiage from old England to America with his wife his son Josiah & daughter Hannah, arrived at Lynn in the Massachusetts Bay, where Josiah married Elisabeth Wheeler and Hannah married Thomas Barden. Said William Witter died at Lynn, his Widows Name was Hannah. She came with her Son Josiah to Stonington and Lived to a Great Age."<br />

William B. 'Bill' Everson , Birmingham: Theater lover was 'a rock' oflocal guild<br />
By many accounts, Bill Everson was the backbone of St. Dunstan's Theatre Guild of Cranbrook.<br />
In his five decades with the group, he performed in numerous productions, directed several, once served as guildpresident, and often worked behind the scenes to head tasks from lighting to set design. He also invigorated cast mates during the Bloomfield Hills guild's pre-play recitation rituals and helped write scripts as well as coordinate original revues.<br />
The work made him "a rock," said longtime friend Sally Garrison, a fellow guild member. "He was always doing what was needed."<br />
Mr. Everson died Saturday, May 12, 2007, at Beaumont Hospital in Royal Oak. He was 81.<br />
Born May 26, 1925, in Stoughton, Wis., he attended the University of Notre Dame before serving in the U.S. Navy. He later earned a business administration degree from the University of Michigan. After a stint working in advertising for the Hudson's department store in Detroit, he became a writer at the MacManus, John & Adams advertising agency. He retired as senior vice president in 1989.<br />
Much of Mr. Everson's free time was devoted to St. Dunstan's, on whose stage he transformed into various characters. In "The Odd Couple," he played Felix, a pedant forced to room with a slob. And in one of his last performances, the 2001 rendition of the Pulitzer Prize-winning play "Harvey," he fleshed out Dr. Chumley, who attempted to locate a man befriending an imaginary rabbit.<br />
"He just liked playing a character," said his wife, Betty. "He enjoyed the whole thing."<br />
A longtime member of the Bloomfield Open Hunt club, Mr. Everson served with the Cultural Council of Birmingham/Bloomfield as well as the Ad Craft Club. He also participated in the Cranbrook Writers' Guild Conference.<br />
For years, He and his wife belonged to the Nomads traveling group, trekking to spots such as England, Norway and Mexico.<br />
An avid gardener, Mr. Everson tended a spot brimming with lilies, one of his favorite flowers.<br />
Besides his wife, other survivors include two sons, Eric and Christopher; a daughter, Margaret Thele; two grandchildren; and a sister-in-law, Geri Paton.<br />
Services have been held.<br />
Memorials may be made to St. Dunstan's Theatre Guild of Cranbrook, P.O. Box 59, Birmingham, MI 48012; or Easter Seals-Adult Mental Health Services, 22170 W. Nine 9 Mile Rd., Southfield, MI 48033.<br />

Mrs. Anna Buckland died at her home in this village Friday noon, December23, 1932, following a short illness.<br />
 Anna Johnstone Buckland was born November 5, 1855 at Lebanon, Wis., a daughter of Rev. and Mrs. J. L. Johnstone, and was one of seven children.  She married Thomas Bloor of Hartford on Dec 12, 1877 and to this family were born four daughters and one son.  The couple spent a few years on farms near Neosho and Hartland and 49 years ago they came to Trenton settling on the R. Newberry farm which the family still owns. Mr. Bloor died in 1890 and later she married James Buckland of Fox Lake and one daughter was born to this union.  Mr. Buckland died 38 years ago.  Mrs. Buckland remained on her farm some years and twenty six years ago moved to the village where she has since resided one of our most respected citizens.  Her life had been one of sorrow and trials but she met each sorrow courageously and cheerfully.  She willingly lent a helping hand in sorrow and sickness.  Besides her own family which she brought up alone she gave a home and a mother's care to a granddaughter, Ella Leidtke, now Mrs. Schoonover who stayed with her grandmother this winter and helped care for her in her last illness.  Mrs. Buckland is survived by four daughters, Mrs. Lehman of Kenosha, Mrs. E. Bolden of Elroy, Mrs. Cook of Palmer, Neb., and Miss Nellie Bloor at home, also one son, Frank Bloor of Wauwatosa, together with several grandchildren and two brothers.  Funeral services were held Monday afternoon at 1:30 from the Presbyterian Church with Rev. Goff assisted by Revs. Strand of Horicon and Rev. Robinson, officiating and interment was in Waushara cemetery.<br />
 She was a quiet unpretentious woman who performed the duties of life day by day.  She was devoted  to her home, a true neighbor and friend and her passing will be greatly regretted by the large circle of friends.<br />
