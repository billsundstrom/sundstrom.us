<br>
Edmund Wright was another of our oldest graduates, belonging to the fourth class. He was born at Easthampton, Mass., on July 1, 1808 (almost four years before Dr. Thompson).  His college training was at Williams in the class of 1836, and his theological course at East Windsor followed immediately.  From the Seminary he went almost at once into mission work at St. Louis. After three years he was ordained there, and in 1843 was installed over the church at Weston, Mo., in the western part of the state, where he remained six years. The next seven years were spent as a missionary pastor in St. Louis. His longest service was that of District Superintendent for Missouri of the American Bible Society, beginning in 1863 and reaching a full twenty-five years, to 1888. In the time of the war and afterward his labors were particularly fruitful, but that his zeal continued strong to the end is shown by the fact that in his last  year in office he traveled almost 25,000 miles and delivered 150 addresses for the cause of Bible dissemination. On his eightieth birthday he resigned, and subsequently removed to Nebraska. In 1893 he went to Seattle, Wash., to live with his daughter, Mrs. William T. Whitney. The testimony borne to the beauty of his character as shown in his last days is that " he was a benediction in our midst." Mr. Wright was married in 1842 to Miss A. F. Hurd, of Bridport, Vt. Their golden wedding was duly celebrated in 1892, and Mrs. Wright survives, with the daughter above named. Mr. Wright.  <br>

His bio is chronicled in the book "Revealing the Non-Secrets: The History of the Founding and Founders of Delta Upsilon Fraternity"<br>
---------------------------<br>
Edmund Wright, son of Ichabod and Mary Clapp Wright, was born in Easthampton, Mass., July 1, 1808; was graduated from Williams College in 1836, and from the Theological Institute of Connecticut in 1839.   Strongly possessed of the missionary spirit he entered at  once into mission work at St. Louis, Mo., where after three  years of service he was ordained. In 1843 ne was installed pastor at Weston, Mo., and continued in the work there six years. Returning to St. Louis he spent the next seven years as a missionary pastor in that city. During the Civil War his labors were abundant and fruitful. From 1863 to 1888 he was District Superintendent for Missouri of the American Bible Society, which position he filled with conspicuous energy and ability. From his last report, rendered on his eightieth birthday, when he resigned the position, it appears that during the last year of his work he traveled 24,467 miles, visited and revisited 80 Auxiliaries, attended 37 Anniversaries, visited 20 Ecclesiastical bodies, sent 440 official letters, distributed 5,450 official documents, and delivered 139 addresses and sermons. From Missouri he went to Nebraska, and later (1893) to Seattle, Wash., to live with his daughter, Mrs. William T. Whitney. During the latter years of his life he was identified with the Presbyterian Church and was deeply interested in its work. From his home in Seattle, July 20, 1901, a few days after his ninety-third birthday, he was summoned to the larger service.   He was married August 11, 1842, to Achsah Fidelia Hurd of Bridport, Vt., who with one daughter survives him. Mr. Hurd occupied an honorable place among that noble company of men of whose work President Roosevelt has so recently spoken these golden words: "Without it the conquest of this continent would have had little but an animal side. Without it the pioneer's fierce and rude virtues and somber faults would have been left unlit by the flames of pure and loving aspiration. Without it the life of this country would have been a life of inconceivably hard and barren materialism. Because of it deep beneath and through the national character there runs the power of firm adherence to a lofty ideal upon which the safety of the nation will ultimately depend.  Honor, thrice honor, to those who for three generations, during the period of this people's great expansion, have seen that the force of the living truth expanded as the nation expanded. They bore the burden and heat of the day, they toiled obscurely and died unknown, that we might come into a glorious heritage." One of his family writes of him in these words: " I would like to tell you how much he thought of all his college associations; looking anxiously for the 'Hartford Seminary Record' and reading it as long as he could read at all, these memories were a constant joy to him during his declining years."   <br>

Wright on 10 November 1856.<br>
By 1860 and through the 1880, per censuses, in Central Township (now Clayton), St. Louis County, MO Horace lived with his second wife, also living with him in 1860, his son Horace E.

        Among the killed at the late battle of Springfield, on Wilson's Creek, Missouri, was Horace E. Wright, only son of Horace Wright, formerly of Northampton.
