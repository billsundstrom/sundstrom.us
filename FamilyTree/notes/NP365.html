<p>
<a name ="I110807"><b>[I110807]</b></a><br />
Jerrold Edward Merrill was born to Claude Richard and Nellie Bowlden Merrill, the youngest of seven siblings.<br>
Though of humble circumstance, he recollected a happy childhood. As was his nature, he remembered difficult times as fond memories. A natural and gifted athlete, he was remarkably humble. It was only through others that we learned of his state championship tennis title in high school, won with a borrowed racket. Any sport he played, he quickly and effortlessly became expert at, all 6'7" of him beautiful, lithe, and smooth. His long fingers and hands appeared those of an artist, not reflecting the difficult work of his every day in the painting business, in support of his family.<br>
Dad met his beautiful sweetheart Beth Eldredge in 1956, they married July 26, 1957. Their marriage was solemnized in the Salt Lake LDS Temple in 1958. They were blessed with seven children; he saw us all as bright lights with limitless potential, he was full of praise and fatherly pride. He loved his wife dearly and spoke of her with respect and amazement, always expressing disbelief that she chose him! We fondly remember family vacations, nothing compared with being held by him and "wave jumping" high above the crests of the ocean. Dad never met a stranger! He saw God in everyone, he quietly loved and sought to serve others.<br>
He is survived by children: Sydna (Mike) Freeman; Shauna (Mike) Brockbank; Kurt (Tammy) Merrill; Kent (Carol) Merrill; Salli (Kent) Brown; Angie (Shawn) Rynearson; 30 grandchildren and three great-grandchildren; by his sister Gloria and brothers William and Richard. He is also survived by his wife Beth, who tenderly cared for him throughout his six month battle with Gastric cancer.<br>
He was preceded in death by beloved son Jay; brothers James and Joseph; sister Patricia. We learned much about dignity and bearing adversity well as we watched our husband and father suffer afflictions without complaint. We will try to honor his good name by emulating his gracious acceptance of difficulties and his ability to see goodness and beauty in all about him. We wish to express gratitude for his caregivers at Utah Cancer Specialists, Dr.'s Miller and Corcoran, and sweet nurse Nora; Symbii Hospice, Rochelle, Megan, Mike and Libby; Nancy Aiken, P.A. at the Veteran's Hospital. Thanks to his dear friends at the Mt. Olympus Senior Citizen Center, he loved them all.<br>
Visitation at Memorial Estates Chapel 3115 East 7800 South on Saturday, September 25 at 10:00 a.m., with services to follow at 11:00 a.m. In lieu of flowers, donations to the Utah Cancer Specialists would be appreciated. Good-Bye, our gentle giant, until we meet again.<br>

When International Harvester went out on strike he drove to Flint, Michigan in the morning and started work that night for "Chevy in the Hole". He also worked for Applegate Chevrolet during the day wrenching on cars till he earned enough to send for Mother...Who was pregnant at the time with my older brother, John.<br>
Here they had two more children, David and Matthew. After a few years he bought a house in Swartz Creek and him and mom lived there for the next 30 years till her death in 1992.<br>

<p>
<a name ="I110802"><b>[I110802]</b></a><br />
On Halloween 2010, William George Merrill gently passed away at the ripe old age of 90. His family was by his side as he moved on to have some more fun on the other side.Bill was born on February 22, 1920 to Claude and Nellie Bowlden Merrill. He was the oldest of seven children. Bill did not have a shy bone in his body, and personality exuded from every pore. He loved to have a good time, and when you were with him you had a good time. It was no accident that he was born on a holiday, and died on a holiday. Bill grew up in a loving family and, during World War II, he was a Link trainer for the US Army. He taught hundreds of pilots how to fly. During the war he met his wife Eunice Nelson. They were married on November 6, 1945. Bill loved the way she could give him a hard time, because he loved a good challenge. After Eunie's passing in 1995, he would always say "If I could find someone that was like your mother, I'd marry her in a minute." He never did. Bill was a top salesman for Skaggs Stone. He was friendly, fun and extremely charming. He could charm the rattles off a rattlesnake. People were drawn to Bill. He had countless friends and people who loved him. He always made you feel good about yourself. If you asked him how he was doing he would reply with his big grin "much better now that you are here." You were always greeted with a "Why hello, Sweetheart!" He was extremely loving and caring. Bill is preceded in death by his parents, wife, two children, Randi and Arthur, brothers Joe, Jimmy and Jerry, and a sister Pat. Bill is survived by his brother Dick (June), his sister Gloria, and his three daughters Lin, Charsti (Vinson) and Scott (Andrew) who will miss him like crazy. He was immensely proud of his grandchildren Michael (Rebecca), Ryan, Margot (Rob) Nick (Brittany), Micah, Zach (Toni), Alex and Michelle. He has three great-grandchildren, Madison, Charlie and Drew, as well as many beloved nieces and nephews. He is also survived by a grand dog Ellie who will miss him sharing half his dinner with her. He was crazy about his family and they were nuts about him. Funeral services will be held on Friday, November 5, 2010 at 11:00 a.m. at Larkin Mortuary, 260 East South Temple. Friends may call Thursday evening from 6:00-8:00 p.m. and one hour prior to services on Friday. Interment in the Salt Lake City Cemetery. In lieu of flowers donate to the Make a Wish Foundation.

June 9, 2003 - it was the day of the my greatest sorrow.  It was the day that saw the passing of my wife, Tristen.  She was 25 years old, and we had so many hopes and dreams for our future together that never came to pass.  She was gone, and I remained.  God, however, desired for me to do more than just remain.  After first sustaining me with His love, He persuaded me that my life would only be full if I invested in people.  Instead of allowing my pain to build up protective walls from others, I was being called to comfort others with the comfort that I, myself, had been comforted with (2 Cor. 1:4).<br>
I knew that God was calling me to seminary, but I also knew that it was not time for me to move away from the support of my family and friends.  The decision to enroll at NABS (now Sioux Falls Seminary) was primarily due to its location.  I soon discovered, however, that there were many more reasons to stay.  From my first class, I felt God affirming my call and equipping me specifically for pastoral ministry.  I have also been greatly blessed by the faculty and community that I have come to know at Sioux Falls Seminary.  The diversity of both the professors and the students has challenged me along the way, and has given be a broad base for ministry.<br>
December 30, 2006 - it was a great day of rejoicing.  It was the day that I married Caroline, a second precious daughter that the Lord has blessed me with.  I've now graduated, and working in a pastoral position.  When I lost Tristen, my life felt so void of purpose.  But since then, God has been refilling my cup. <br>
<br>
If you feel God telling you that it is time to pursue His calling for your life, don't wait any longer.  He wants to do amazing things in and through you.<br>

MERRITT, Robert Robert Merritt, 98, of Glastonbury, died Monday, (November 19, 2007) at Hartford Hospital after a brief illness. He was predeceased by his wife of 57 years, Mary (McAleer) Merritt, a son, Peter Charles, and a sister, Priscilla Dow. He is survived by his daughters, Priscilla Ann and her husband Louis Montalvo of Colchester, Cynthia Elizabeth of Glastonbury, and son, Robert Nicholas and his wife Susan Lennon of Hartford, and grandchildren Katherine Wang of Philadelphia and Stephen Wang of Glastonbury. He is also survived by his sister, Barbara Nason of Concord, NH, and twelve nieces and nephews. Bob was born August 29, 1909, in South Hadley Falls, MA, the son of Harry T. and Ethel (Moore) Merritt and was raised in Wolfeboro, NH. He graduated from Harvard College in 1930, Magna Cum Laude and Phi Beta Kappa. He attended his 75th class reunion in Cambridge two years ago. During his years in Wolfeboro, he worked in the Western Union telegraph office and ran a printing shop with his father. He worked in Boston and New York before coming to Hartford in 1945. He worked for Connecticut Savings Bank Life Insurance and the State Insurance Department before joining Phoenix Mutual Life, where he worked for most of his career. He was a Fellow of the Society of Actuaries and, after retiring, consulted at The Phoenix until the age of 93. Bob was active in Glastonbury town government, serving on its first Town Council and later as chair of the Board of Education.

He ran for State Representative from Glastonbury in 1976. With his quick wit, he was frequently called upon to compose and recite doggerel for birthdays and other special occasions, and was known to come up with spontaneous limericks. He and Mary enjoyed classical music and opera, and they sang together in the Hartford Chorale for nearly 20 years. They enjoyed spending time on Martha's Vineyard and in Colrain, MA, and traveled widely in their later years, particularly to Italy, their favorite. Bob's family would like to offer its heartfelt appreciation to Mary Hough-Scholl and Barbara Cooper, who provided loving and attentive care to Bob and made it possible for him to continue living in his home after Mary's death.
