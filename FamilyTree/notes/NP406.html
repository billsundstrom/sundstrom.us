Nellie Martina OLSON
<p>
<a name ="I088913"><b>[I088913]</b></a><br />
Nellie was born June 26, 1911 and raised on a farm 10 miles north of Lake Preston, SD. She was the youngest child of 13 born to Jensena Louise (Stenson) and Arne Olson. She attended rural grade school and graduated from Lake Preston High School in 1932. Shortly thereafter, she moved to Sioux Falls, SD. where she worked for a time as a live-in housekeeper/babysitter. She married George Arthur Larson of Erwin, SD in 1934. For the next 10 years they resided in a rental house at 1302 W. 7th street in Sioux Falls and began raising a family consisting of five children, three girls and two boys. George supported the family by working at Bells Creamery for several years and then later for John Morrel Meat Packing Plant. They purchased a home at 715 S. Summit Ave. and a few months later, on May 7, 1945 (the same day WWII ended) George died suddenly of an apparent heart attack at the age of 33. Their children ranged in age from 10 years to 5 months. Following George's death, for the next 27 years, Nellie continued living in her south Summit Ave. house. To help support herself and her children, she opened her home as a day care center. For a short time she also did some foster care both for infants awaiting adoption and for troubled young girls. After her own kids left home, she became employed with Fantles Dept.. Store from 1961 - 1978 working in both the alterations dept. and in the tea room cafe doing cooking and baking, specializing in pies. She worked at Fantles until the store closed, having been there for 17 years. Nellie then took employment at Davis Tailors & Dry Cleaning, again doing alterations. She worked for them from 1978 to 1985, a total of 7 years. She left there at the age of 74. During this same period of time, she moved to a smaller home at 815 N. Prairie Ave. in 1971. For 5 years thereafter she took in alterations at her home but finally retired for good at the age of 79. In 1997 Nellie moved to Good Samaritan Village due to failing health. Nellie was a tireless worker, an excellent seamstress and did beautiful hand-crochet work. All of her children have been furnished with an abundant supply of her handiwork. Another strong interest has always been her love of flowers and plants. Her backyard always looked very much like a well groomed park in the summertime. Nellie loved the Christmas season and always went all out to make it a festive and memorable event, the Norwegian Lefsa and Kringla always the highlight. Nellie was raised in the Lutheran faith being confirmed in 1925. After George's death, she became a member of the Westside Evangelical Free Chruch where she attended for many years. However, as she didn't drive a car, in later years, she resorted to attending services via TV. She watched Christian Channel 30 faithfully for many years. Nellie professes a very strong faith and trust in Jesus Christ and depended on God to be her provider, protector, and most importantly, her savior. In addition to her husband, Nellie was preceded in death by her youngest son, Clifford George, who died in 1980 at the age of 35. Grateful for having shared her life are one son, Eugene and Jan Larson of Crooks, SD; three daughters, Darlene and Bob Kennedy of Beresford, SD, Bonnie and Dick Shrogren, and Delores and Gordon Hansen all of Sioux Falls, SD; a sister, Alvina Jensen of New Ulm, MN; 19 grandchildren: 2 step-grandchildren; 24 great-grandchildren, 5 step-great-grandchildren, 5 great-great-grandchildren; and numerous nieces, nephews and fiends."

Tilford Martin OLSON
<p>
<a name ="I065185"><b>[I065185]</b></a><br />
Tilford Martin "Pat" Olson passed peacefully into eternal life on January 17, 2009 at the Glacial Ridge Hospital in Glenwood, MN.<br>
Pat was born in Glenwood, MN. on September 21, 1919 to Fred T. and Alma(Mickelson) Olson. Pat was an infant when the family moved to Cyrus, MN. He graduated from Cyrus High School in 1937 and was proud to say that he, his wife Rachel and their three children all graduated from Cyrus High School. Pat also attended the West Central School of Agricultural in Morris.<br>
He was united in marriage to Rachel Estenson in July of 1941. He enlisted in the military and proudly served in the United States Army from 1941 to October of 1945. He was awarded numerous medals for his service to his country, including two Purple Hearts. Pat was a part of the Normandy invasion - landing on Omaha Beach. He fought in the hedgerow countryside in France, served in Belgium, the Battle of the Bulge, the Ardennes, and in Germany. Pat created a treasure for his family and friends by writing about these experiences and creating a book titled "Mission Accomplished." This project caused him great turmoil - evoking painful memories for him. He is now free of the nightmares and bad dreams that were with him for more than 60 years. Upon discharge from the Army, Pat and his brother Warren (Wub) owned and operated Olson Brother's Red Owl in Cyrus. Warren eventually moved to South Dakota but Pat continued owning and operating Olson's Red Owl in Cyrus until 1982.<br>
While Pat and his wife raised three children and worked in the Red Owl store 6 days a week, he was also active in his beloved community of Cyrus. He served as chief of the fire department for over 30 years, was a leader in the construction of a new fire hall, was active in the Commercial Club, Cyrus Boosters, the Cyrus Lions Club, he was Clerk of the Cyrus School Board - serving during the time of construction of the new elementary school building, he served on the Council of Cyrus Lutheran Church, created items for sale at the church bazaar and silent auction, he was deeply involved in events celebrating the Cyrus Centennial. Pat was the "voice" of the Friday night drawings for "Cyrus Bucks", he was a business owner who always helped with the decorating of the lamp posts of Cyrus for the Christmas season, and he organized a go-kart track just outside of town which became a regular Sunday afternoon racing spot for teenage drivers. He was also a member of the American Legion - Cyrus and then the Morris Post, Veterans of Foreign Wars and Disabled American Veterans. Pat also served for a period of time on the Pope County Health Board. During his retirement years he continued his service to Cyrus and the area by serving on Cyrus All School Reunion committees, promoting the Cyrus Math Science and Technology Elementary School by building parade floats and the school mascot - Dr. Megabyte, he also built play kitchen furniture for the Cyrus Daycare Center.<br>
Pat was an inspiration to his 3 children and 5 grandchildren teaching them to be responsible, to accomplish something each day and - in whatever you do - do an excellent job. Serve your community and serve your fellow man.<br>
Pat will be remembered by many for his creativity, as a child making toys and even a snowmobile, he showed his creativity in the various displays and decorations he made for their grocery store, his Halloween costumes - even as an 85 year old, and his homemade Christmas decorations for the yard. At the age of 88 he was featured in the January 2008 issue of the Senior Perspective. The article conveyed that he was persistent in making everything as perfect as possible. He would think of something to create, draw up a plan and make it work.<br>
It is important to remember what the dash in our lives represents. For Pat the dash between 1919 and 2009 was filled with honor, and love of God, family, community and country.<br>
Pat was preceded in death by his devoted wife Rachel to whom he was married for 60 years. He was also preceded in death by his parents, two sisters and two brothers.<br>
He is survived by daughter Terryle of Washington, D.C., son Bruce (Marie Anderson) Olson of Alexandria, Mn., daughter Barbara (Tom Hesse) of Morris, Mn., five<br>
grandchildren - of whom Pat was so very proud - Jon Hesse of Fargo, N.D., Kristoff Olson of Chapel Hill, N.C., Kellie Hesse of Fargo, N.D., Lydia Olson of Plymouth, Mn.,<br>
and Ahna Olson of Madison, WI. Also surviving are two sisters Marion (Grant) Cross of Apple Valley, MN, Helen Larson of Starbuck, MN, a host of nieces and nephews and special friend and companion Sylvia Behl of Starbuck, MN. <br>
