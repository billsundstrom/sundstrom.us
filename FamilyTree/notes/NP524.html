James Luther SUDDARTH
<p>
<a name ="I097666"><b>[I097666]</b></a><br />
James Luther Suddarth went to be with his Savior, Jesus on November 25, 2012 at the age of 80.  Jim was born on February 6, 1932 in Chickasha, Oklahoma to Luther James "Bill" Suddarth and Beulous "Penny" Suddarth.  While attending Oklahoma A & M (now Oklahoma State University) in Stillwater, Jim served as an intern at Boeing in Seattle for two summers.  Upon graduation, he accepted an offer to work for them as an Aeronautical Engineer where he stayed until his retirement in 1992, 37 years later.<br>
Jim loved music, photography, airplanes and camping.  He played both the accordion and the organ and many Sunday mornings, the sound of classical hymns from the organ would be heard prior to the family going to church.  He was known by all for his photography-both beautiful scenic shots and pictures and films of friends and family.  No one was safe from his camera-especially when eating!  And then there were the planes . . .  A childhood passion, he managed to turn it into a career that he loved-staying at the same company from right out of college until his retirement.  Air shows were a common family outing, along with feeding the ducks at Lake Washington while watching the planes take off and land.  It probably wasnʼt an accident that he lived five minutes from a major airport.  What some considered noise, he considered "music to the ears."<br>
Jim loved the beauty of the outdoors and was determined to expose his family to it as much as possible.  Hiking in the Pacific Northwest, visiting Yellowstone and the Grand Canyon; looking for agates along the Pacific Coast, hunting for arrowheads in the New Mexico dessert, laying on top of the dunes at White Sands star gazing-all memories that he gave to his family.  Many summers were spent camping at Banks Lake, waterskiing and enjoying family and friends.  Jim had a ʻwicked" sense of humor which his children didnʼt necessarily appreciate, but his grandchildren certainly did and apparently inherited the trait.<br>
The most important things in Jimʼs life, though, were his family and friends and his faith.  They were intricately intertwined with each other.  Jim lived his faith and his knowledge of Godʼs Word was the foundation of everything he did and said.  He was a man of deep commitment, integrity and honor.  <br>
Jim is survived by his loving wife of 56 years, Carol; his children, Kathy Klemz (Craig), Judy Goodanetz, Sharon Carter (David); his ten grandchildren and numerous nieces and nephews.  He will be deeply missed, but we know that this separation is only temporary.  He is at home with Jesus, completely whole and at peace.<br>
A Memorial Service will be held on Sunday, December 30, 2012 at 2:00 pm at Our Saviorʼs Baptist Church in Federal Way, Washington.<br>
