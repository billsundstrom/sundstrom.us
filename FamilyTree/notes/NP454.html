Edward Dale RINTYE
<p>
<a name ="I086408"><b>[I086408]</b></a><br />
Ed Rintye: Teacher suicide met with sober reflection<br>
GrossmontCommunity College speech instructor Ed Rintye was almost 90 minutes late for a meeting last Saturday morning at colleague Richard Larson's home.<br>
"So," Larson said, "at about 11:20, I called and got his phone answering machine."<br>
"Call the coroner," he heard Rintye's recorded voice say. "There's been a suicide. I'm sorry that you're the one that's received this message."<br>
Larson promptly called the police, and, a few minutes later, an officer arrived at Rintye's North Park home. He found the 46-year-old teacher slumped in a living room chair, a bullet wound in his head.<br>
Rintye left behind his wife, Patricia, two children from previous marriages, a half-brother in Las Vegas, his mother in Seattle -- and a community of students and colleagues who are still trying to understand one of the most controversial instructors in the junior college's 22-year history.<br>
Just last semester, Patricia Rintye remembers, her husband assigned students in one of his interpersonal relations class to write suicide notes.<br>
"I never found out what the result was of that assignment," she says, but adds that she's sure it had nothing to with her husband's death.<br>
"He took everybody by surprise (with his assignments), and this assignment would have been no more off-the-wall than anything else," she says.<br>
"He liked using theatrical techniques as metaphor, to make a point, to get a message across to the students ... He was always innovating; he was very alert to new information. He loved what he did."<br>
Patricia was Rintye's third wife; they met in the late '70s when she was a student in one of his classes, and were married in 1981. She had not been living with him in recent weeks. "We were separated, but still very much in contact," she says.<br>
She can offer no reasons for what Rintye did last weekend, and she dismisses any suggestion that his classroom manner was symptomatic of any deeper problem.<br>
But she does acknowledge that the idea of suicide was always with her husband. Several of his friends agree.<br>
"We did know that, over the years, suicide was always an alternative in Ed's mind," says Larson, also a speech instructor at Grossmont. "To be close to Ed meant to kind of know that.<br>
"We knew he was upset, but there was no reason to think that this was going to happen ... There was nothing external going on in his life that he couldn't handle. This was an internal choice."<br>
Larson joined Rintye's family for a private memorial service at 3 p.m. yesterday.<br>
Edward Rintye joined the staff at Grossmont on Sept. 10, 1968, after a year of teaching at Cal Western College in Point Loma. He was born in La Porte, Ind., and held a bachelor's degree from Western Michigan University and a master's from San Diego State. He later took a doctorate from U.S. International University. He served with the Marines in Vietnam and reached the rank of captain.<br>
One of his first steps at Grossmont was to embark on "The Idea Program," a course that featured team-teaching in psychology, art, science and speech.<br>
That program lasted about four years, after which he concentrated on his main area of expertise, interpersonal communication. He published a textbook on the subject, "Centering a Lopsided Egg."<br>
"He was into what we called in those days a 'touchy-feely' approach," remembers Ed Claussen, a history teacher at Grossmont and president of the faculty Senate from 1980-82. "About 1972 to 1974, he required students to wear leotards in his class."<br>
The idea was to concentrate on body language, a subject Rintye was very interested in. <br>
"Considering the outrageousness of that requirement, there was only a ripple of discussion about it," Claussen recalls.<br>
Claussen also remembers another technique of Rintye's to get the attention of his students and arouse discussion -- tearing down an American flag and stomping it on the floor.<br>
But neither Claussen, nor other colleagues, ever viewed Rintye's antics as threatening to students.<br>
"To classify Ed as a kook would be inaccurate," says Neil Towne, a friend and colleague in the speech department.<br>
"Ed didn't do anything without a good reason ... <br>
He was a very colorful guy, and he rubbed a lot of people the wrong way. I think he insulted students very often, but he was insulting them to get them to move."<br>
In the process, Towne adds, Rintye taught a lot of students a lot of things.<br>
"There were many who would gladly have become his disciples," he says, "if he had chosen to take disciples."<br>
Towne remembers Rintye appearing in clownface on the first day of a new semester, then launching into a lecture on the many figurative masks people wear every day.<br>
Elaine McLevie, dean of the communication and fine arts department, says Rintye was a good teacher and that she'd never head a major complaint about his style.<br>
"Whenever I talked with him, I came away wanting to read something, to learn something," she says. "He had an ability to make people think about life.<br>
"The problems that he was running into were strictly personal."<br>
Susan Kaveney, a student in Rintye's Speech 120 class last semester, calls him the most eccentric teacher she's ever had.<br>
"I learned a lot from him," she adds. "Everybody was looking forward to coming back and talking to him. He was an excellent teacher -- there was a lot to him."<br>
Kaveney says Rintye donned no particular costumes for her class, nor did he make unusual writing assignments. But he was different.<br>
"He made us at one time go out and four times a day introduce ourselves to a perfect stranger," she recalls. "We had a step-by-step process to do this. We had to get to the boundaries of their personal space."<br>
She also remembers a formal complaint from a group of students concerned about Rintye's frequent profanity in class. After word of it got back to him, Kaveney says, he made a sincere effort to rein in his language. Still, she says, "he talked about sex a lot."<br>
He also cited examples from his personal life as examples in facing theoretical problems. He mentioned to the class that he was separated from his wife and in the process of a divorce, Kaveney says, but didn't dwell on it.<br>
On the Wednesday following Rintye's suicide, Kaveney got together with a classmate to talk about it.<br>
"We were angry with him, because he didn't follow his own advice ... It's so hypocritical. He would talk so much about (having to) learn to deal with your problems. 'Don't cop out,' he said. But no one knows what went through his mind when he did this.<br>
"He's the type of person that if he wanted to do something, he'd just do it -- not think about it, but do it."<br>
Last Friday was full of promises for Rintye.<br>
His Christmas vacation had just begun, and he was planning a trip with Patricia to visit friends up the coast. He and Larson were progressing on a manuscript about interpersonal communication.<br>
That morning, he'd learned that morning of his selection for a computer science scholarship at National University. He cheerfully discussed its possibilities with a student in the mid-afternoon.<br>
About 5 p.m., he talked on the phone with Larson's wife, Sarah, about help he was giving her with a thesis paper.<br>
But, sometime between Friday evening and Saturday morning, Edward Rintye lost interest in the future.<br>
