WEDDINGS. <br>
PRENTISS - CARMAN<br>
A wedding of more than ordinary interest in society took place at the Reformed Church on the Heights last evening. The bride was Miss Mary Adella Carman, niece of Nelson Garrison Carman, of 54 Pierrepont street, and the bridegroom, Russell E. Prentiss, is a son of George Hunt Prentiss, the Wall street broker, who resides at 77 First place. The pulpit was handsomely adorned with palms and lilies. Bunches of yellow chrysanthemums were secured to the pew posts along the centre aisle. The bridegroom graduated from Amherst College in 1895, and he had for his best man a classmate, C. Roy Bangs. Among the six ushers were Howard Mossman and Albert Mossman, of the senior class at Amherst. The other four were George Walsh, W. W. Walsh, Jr., Dr. F. H. Birmingham and John Louis Lockwood, of New York City. The bride was attended by her sister. Miss Sadie Carman, and Miss Marjorie Prentiss, as maids of honor, and by the Misses Florence Badger, Lucy Otterson, Flora Clouser and Elizabeth Deake as bridesmaids. Three ministers assisted at the ceremony- the Rev. J. Douglas Adam, pastor of the Reformed Church on the Heights; the Rev. Dr. Albert J. Lyman, pastor of the South Congregational Church, which the family of the bridegroom attends; and the Rev. Samuel A. Eliot, pastor of the Unitarian Church of the Saviour, a warm personal friend of the bride's uncle. The bride, who was escorted to the altar by her uncle, wore a gown of white satin, adorned with point lace, and the regulation veil. She carried lilies of the valley. Miss Prentiss wore white mousseline de soie, and Miss Carman, the other maid of honor, was dressed in pink satin. The bridesmaids wore gowns made alike of white mousseline de soie. They carried pink chrysanthemums. A reception was held after the ceremony at the residence of the Carmans on Pierrepont street. Mr. and Mrs. Prentiss have gone on a tour South. They will give three at homes at 77 First place, Jan. 12, 19 and 26. <br>
