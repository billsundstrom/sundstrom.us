DUNDAS WOMAN DIES SUDDENLY<br>
Mrs. Clifford Thielbar's Death Brings Sorrow to Entire Dundas Community.<br>
The tragic death of Mrs. Clifford Thielbar early Sunday evening, Jan. 18, came as a great shock and cast gloom over the whole community. Mrs. Thielbar was up for the first time that day since the birth of her daughter January 3. She seemed to be feeling well and was in good spirits. Her mother, who had been staying with her, left for home only a hlaf hour before her death. Mrs. Thielbar fell suddenly headlong, striking her head on the radiator. A fractured skull resulted from the fall, but Mrs. Thielbar is believed to have died instantly before falling.<br>
Cynthia A. Porter was born June 22, 1890, at the farm home of her parents, Mr. and Mrs. B. L. Porter, two miles south of Dundas. She was brought up in the Little Prarie Community and was married to Clifford Thielbar of Dundas, December 20, 1910.<br>
Mrs. Thielbar was the mother of eleven children, all of whom are living at home. They are Raymond, Eva, Leona, Martha, Myrtle, Fay, Wilma, Calvin, Alvan, Eugene and a baby girl. She is also survived by her husband and parents and by two brothers and one sister. The brothers are C.W.Porter of Bismarck, N.D., who arrived Tuesday to attend the funeral, and Floyd Porter of Little Prarie; and the sister, is Mrs. I.N. Taylor of LIttle Chicago. Mrs. Thielbar was a niece of Mrs. A.R. Kolb and Sam Canedy of Dundas.<br>
The spring after their marriage Mr. and Mrs. Thielbar went to Yellow Grass, Saskatchewan, where Mr. Thielbar had previously taken a claim. They lived there until December, 1912, when they returned to Dundas and Mr. Thielbar went into partnership with his father, A.J. Thielbar, in the Thielbar Mercantile company. In 1922, he sold his share in the business and bought a farm 4 1/2 miles southeast of Dundas. This was their home until October, 1928, when they again moved to Dundas and Mr. Thielbar became the sole owner of the Thielbar Mercantile company.<br>
Mrs. Thielbar was a lifelong member of the Methodist church. She also belonged to the Rebekah lodge in Dundas.<br>
Funeral services for Mrs. Thielbar were held at the house at 2:00 o'clock and at the Methodist church at 2:30 o'clock Wednesday afternoon. The Rev. W.E. Thompson, pastor of the local church, was the officiating clergyman. "Beautiful Isle of Somewhere," "Sometimes We'll Understand," and "Asleep in Jesus" were the hymns sung at the church. "God Be With You Till We Meet Again" was sung at the grave. Interment was in Groveland cemetery. The pallbearers were E.T. Larkin, Roy Hoover, Everett Hoover, Gilmore Hufton, Frank Conrad, and Frank tralle.<br>
Among those from away who were present for the funeral were the following: Mrs. Louis Younker and son, Clifford, and Mrs. Merrill Taggart of Minneapolis; Mr. and Mrs. August Lieder of Faribault; Mr. and Mrs. Joseph Hatfield of Duluth: and CoWoPorter of Bismarck, N.D. There were also many from Little prarie and other meighboring communities.<br>
Mrs. Thielbar will be much missed not only in her own home, where a large family of children will be without the loving care of a mother but by her many friends in the community, who have known and loved her all her life. <br>
