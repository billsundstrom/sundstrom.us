-----------------------------------------------------<br>
Dr. Athol Leith Roberts, who served terms as president of the Canadian Medical Association and Medical Society of P.E.I., died Monday in Charlottetown. He was 88.<br>
Roberts served as P.E.I. president from 1967-1969 and in 1987, following years of service on the boards of the CMA, he was elected national president. <br>
Born June 7, 1921, in Highfield, P.E.I., Roberts' first calling was to the ministry. He became an ordained Baptist minister in 1943.<br>
The call to medicine came later. In 1954, he received his MD from Dalhousie University Medical School. Throughout his training he continued to provide ministry for Baptist churches in Cape Sable Island and North Sydney.<br>
Roberts also acted as chaplain for the Royal Canadian Army Chaplaincy Corps in Nova Scotia from 1944-1953 and as a physician for the Royal Canadian Army Medical Corps from 1954-1959.<br>
Following military service, Roberts returned home where he began a family practice at the Polyclinic in Charlottetown. Throughout his career, he was an active member of the staff at the P.E.I. Hospital, Charlottetown Hospital and subsequently, the Queen Elizabeth Hospital where he also provided services as family physician and anesthesiologist.<br>
His involvement in medicine included participation in many related organizations. He was a council member of the Canadian Medical Protective Association from 1977-1994. He was an active member of the College of Family Physicians of Canada and served a term as commissioner of the P.E.I. Hospital Services Commission. <br>
"There will be some who remember Dr. Roberts as one of the last GP/anesthetists in P.E.I.," said Dr. Colin McMillan of Charlottetown, also a CMA past president.<br>
"However, I knew Athol from our shared passion for the political side of medicine. We both were privileged to have been elected to serve in our respective roles as president of the Canadian Medical Association."<br>
McMillan said Roberts told him that one of the highlights of his year as CMA president was attending the official opening of Casey House Hospice in Toronto. <br>
"At that time, the facility was one of the world's first hospices for people with HIV/AIDS. It opened in 1988 - a time when the world was still coming to terms with the disease and its stigma - but Athol recognized the need to provide care with compassion." <br>
Roberts was recognized for his work in palliative care. Illness prevented his involvement in the Canadian Hospice Palliative Care Conference being held this week in Charlottetown. A longtime supporter of the Hospice Palliative Care Association of P.E.I., Roberts was awarded life membership in 2006. <br>
He became a Fellow of the College of Physicians of Canada in 1979. In 1989, the Canadian Medical Association awarded Senior Membership and in 1999, his dedication as a physician was recognized by the Medical Society where he received Life Membership. <br>
Visiting hours at the MacLean Funeral Home Swan Chapel will be held Thursday from 2-4 and 7-9 p.m. The funeral is Friday at 11 a.m. from the First Baptist Church in Charlottetown.<br>
He is survived by his wife Ruth V. Roberts (nee Vincent) and the following children: Nancy Prowse (Bill), Susan Wenaus (Jack), David (Susan), Linda McTaggart (Douglas) and Hui Jun Sun (Julian Ding).<br>

Kenneth George ROBERTS
<p>
<a name ="I037295"><b>[I037295]</b></a><br />
Kenneth George Roberts, 71, died December 20, 2017 after coping with the effects of dementia for far too long. Though we may never know what he was aware of during the last decade of his life, we can find peace in knowing that he was surrounded by loving family and friends to the end.<br>
Born on June 28, 1946 to Helen Miriam Johnson and George Harold Roberts in San Francisco, CA, he grew up in an idyllic time for which he was perfectly suited. His natural disposition to just be a good guy could be witnessed by all who knew him. He excelled in athletics, and after graduating from high school he went on to play college football at San Francisco State University, where he majored in Physical Education. He met his future wife, Julie Ann Kuehn, there, and they married on August 31, 1970. They stayed in the city while he finished school, and trained as a member of the 1972 Olympic Wrestling team. At one point, he was ranked 2nd in the nation for Greco Roman wrestling as a heavy weight. He stayed back from the Games to be home for the birth of their first child.<br>
In October 1972, he was baptized as a Jehovahʼs Witness. He served in many ways: going to where the need was great, serving as a Ministerial Servant, and finally by taking on the role of Elder. As much as he appreciated his gifts of body, he much preferred his gifts of Spirit, and served faithfully for many years.<br>
After returning to school to get his degree in teaching, Kenn worked with the inmates at California State Penitentiary in Vacaville, from 1988 until his retirement in 2003, as a teacher in the recreation yard and classroom. The inmates quickly grew to respect him after he and an inmate named Rock, watched by inmates and guards alike, squared off in a wrestling match (which Rock had been badgering Kenn to do for many months). After pinning Rock in three seconds, Rock claimed that is wasnʼt fair and wanted a re-match. Obligingly, Kenn gave him a few more chances, with the same result. After that, no one bothered to mess around with Coach!<br>
On July 26, 1997 Kenn married Vera Marie Scott, and following his retirement, they moved to Marion, MT to be with his family. At this point he had already been experiencing some of the effects of dementia, but they continued to enjoy hiking, trips to Glacier Park, watching their grandchildrenʼs sports and other activities, and the wonderful Montana people for some time.<br>
Kenn is survived by his wife, Vera; daughters Alice (Brett) Bennetts of Kalispell, Eden Roberts of Kalispell, and Sharon Sherman of Loomis; son Isaac (Linda) Roberts of Sacramento; his stepsons Oran (Teresa) of San Francisco and Jereb (Amber) of San Diego;  sister Kathy (Tom) Clausen of Benicia; brother Keith (Jenny) Roberts of Sacramento; grandchildren Natasha, Malachi, Rhiannon and Anika Bennetts, Jonah (and his wife Natalya), Maya, Solomon, and Ava Franchi, Michael and Arlo Sherman, Jasper Sherman-Holt; great-grandson Jackson Plummer; and nieces and nephews as well. He was preceded in death by his father and mother, and by brother Raymond Thomas Roberts.<br>

Marjory "Margie" Louise Roberts Pontious, 83, of Grant, went to the Lord on Saturday, January 18, 2014, while spending time in Coffeyville, KS with her daughter, Kim. She was born on May 4, 1930 in Marion, Michigan, the daughter of Ira and Emily (Bullard) Roberts who have preceded her in death. The family moved to Grant when Marjory was a young child. She attended Grant Public Schools and graduated from Grant High School in 1948. Following graduation she took employment with Michigan Bell Telephone Company as an operator, helping out in the family business, Roberts Drug Store as well. On June 12, 1953 she married Charles O. Pontious, the newlyweds remaining in Grant.<br>
Marjory was a member of the Grant United Church of Christ, now Grant Community Church, and was active in all church affairs. She was a member of several Women's Fellowship Circles, performed in the Bell Choir, sang in the church choir and served on many committees throughout the years. As a teenager she taught swimming lessons at Blanche Lake and enjoyed traveling to Chicago to visit relatives. As her own family grew, she became active in Girl Scouts and PTA. She volunteered untold hours at the schools and chaperoned school activities. Marjory loved hand-crafts and was well-known for delivering hand-made May baskets to many front doors, slipping away undetected. She was a member of the Red Hat Society and was a Hospice Clown volunteer. She loved anything historical and was a member of the Newago County Historical Society, dressing in period clothing and attending events throughout the year. She was a passionate supporter of all veterans organizations, loved plays and musicals and all things Norman Rockwell. Her collection of Angels was legendary. She was employed by the Newago County Medical Care Facility, retiring in 1992.<br>
