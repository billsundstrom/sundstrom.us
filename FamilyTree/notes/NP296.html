Minnie Mae KINGSLEY
<p>
<a name ="I011810"><b>[I011810]</b></a><br />
COEUR d'ALENE - Minnie McDonald turns 90 on Sept. 15.<br>
But that doesn't spell the end of her 43-year career at the St. Vincent de Paul thrift store in Coeur d'Alene, ringing up sales behind the counter.<br>
She loves to work.<br>
There's plenty of time left for gardening and watching "The Bold and the Beautiful" and "The Young and the Restless" once she's off the clock.<br>
"There are so many people who are customers that I've taken care of for years," McDonald said Tuesday. "And I enjoy the girls I work with."<br>
"We have generations of families who patronize our stores," said Barb Smalley, St. Vincent de Paul of North Idaho's development director. "Many come in and make a point to see and say hi to Minnie."<br>
She was a little nervous on her first day behind the counter in 1972.<br>
"Well, I'd never done anything like that before," McDonald said. "Way back, I was always really bashful and quiet."<br>
But the love for work was stronger and kept her going.<br>
She originally is from Ekalaka, Mont., not far from where the state lines of Montana, North Dakota and South Dakota meet.<br>
She lived in Ekalaka until she was 18 and graduated from high school in 1944.<br>
She moved to Miles City, Mont., to attend telegrapher school and then worked for the Milwaukee Road railroad.<br>
She was a telegraph operator during World War II.<br>
"That's when they had the troops go on trains," she said.<br>
She worked at telegraph stations north of Billings in towns like Ryegate and Lavina.<br>
In 1946, she met and married her late husband, Jacob Aaron McDonald.<br>
After working for a time on a Montana ranch, they moved to Kellogg so he could work underground at the bustling Bunker Hill Mine.<br>
He stayed at the mine for more than 30 years, and then died of lung cancer in 1985.<br>
For most of those years before the mine closed, they lived in Medimont.<br>
Soon the call of work and the need to pay bills brought her back to what she loves - being employed.<br>
She got a job as a housekeeper in Coeur d'Alene, where she spent nine years.<br>
One day when she was shopping at the thrift store, an employee recommended she apply for a job. She did, and the rest is history.<br>
For 32 of the 43 years she has been at the store, she also worked as a nurse's aide.<br>
But she quit working as a nurse's aide after it became too much about entering data into computers and too little about patient care.<br>
She was just hitting her stride at the thrift store when she needed heart surgery at age 88. Since then, she had to cut back on her hours.<br>
She currently puts in just less than 30 hours per week. She said it's like being on vacation all the time.<br>
Smalley said they'll take what they can get, as McDonald is an inspiration to many.<br>
"I guess many years back, when her husband died, she took on three different jobs to pay for all of his medical expenses," Smalley said. "What character!"<br>
Look for McDonald at the third annual St. Vinny's Fashion Show at the Coeur d'Alene Resort on Oct. 19.<br>
"Minnie will again walk the runway," Smalley said.<br>

Joseph Walker KINNAMON
<p>
<a name ="I044418"><b>[I044418]</b></a><br />
JOSEPH W. KINNAMON is another of the progressive citizens who came in an early day to what is now Scotts Bluff county, then a part of Cheyenne county, and here his cumulative success has been on a parity with the remarkable development and advancement of the county during the intervening years. In 1888 he here entered claim to a homestead, near Gering, and his good judgment likewise led him to file also on preëmption and tree claims, the whole comprising a tract which he reclaimed from the wilds and developed into a productive and valuable farm estate. He disposed of a portion of his land, but still retains a model farm of 130 acres, worth $400.00 per acre, which he utilizes for diversified agriculture and stock-growing and which is situated one-half mile northwest of Gering. Mr. Kinnamon has been essentially one of the influential men of this locality and has achieved prosperity of a substantial order, the while he has at all times commanded unqualified popular confidence and good will. His farm has the best of irrigation facilities and is well improved in all respects. He is chairman of the company controlling the Gering irrigation ditch, and has aided in the constructior (sic) of other ditches in the county. He was one of the organizers of the Gering National Bank and continued as a stockholder and director of this representative institution. In former years Mr. Kinnamon conducted for a time a meat market at Gering, as did he also a feed and implement store. His political allegiance is given to the Democratic party. He is affiliated with the Masonic fraternity and his religious faith is that of the Methodist Episcopal church, of which his wife likewise was a devout member, she having been the daughter of a clergyman of that denomination.<br>
   Mr. Kinnamon was born in Clinton county, Ohio, on the 16th of March, 1861, and is a son of James and Louisa (Wherry) Kinnamon, both likewise natives of the old Buckeye state, where the father became the owner of a good farm and was an honored citizen of Clinton county. Both he and his wife passed the closing years of their lives in the state of Ohio. Of the ten children, four are living: James A. is a farmer in Illinois; Thos. W. likewise follows agricultural pursuits in that county; Harry, a half-brother, resides in Ohio; and Joseph W. is the immediate subject of this review. The father was a Democrat in politics and both he and his wife held membership in the Christian church.<br>
   Joseph W. Kinnamon gained his youthful education in the public schools of Ohio and was sixteen years of age when he became a resident of Illinois. When he was twenty-four years old be came to Nebraska and established his residence in Gage county, where he remained three years. He then, in 1888, came to what is now Scotts Bluff county, where he has since maintained his home and where his success has kept pace with the growth and development of the county.<br>
   In 1902 was solemnized the marriage of Mr. Kinnamon to Miss Loura E. Mann, who was born and reared in this state and whose death occurred in 1917. Of the three children of this union two died in infancy, and the survivor, Joseph Carl, remains on the home farm and is attending school.<br>
