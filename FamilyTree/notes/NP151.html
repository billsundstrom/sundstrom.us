Eliza J. DOW
<p>
<a name ="I030812"><b>[I030812]</b></a><br />
Mrs. Eliza Dundas died of typhoid fever, Jan. 15, 1929 at her home in Tobacco township. Eliza J. Dow was born June 25, 1872, at her home in Tobacco township and was married in 1890 to Jas. Dundas, who died March 22, 1922. Mr. and Mrs. Dundas were the parents of seven children, James Gordon of Detroit, Mrs. Julia Partridge of Toledo, Ohio; Mrs. Hazel Greer of Midland, Mrs. Margaret Raymond of Beaverton, Mrs. Agnes Greer of Gladwin, and Mac and Alma at home, who survive her with 10 grandchildren; her mother, Mrs. Julia F. Knox; one sister, Mrs. John Rich; two brothers, Jay Dow of Toledo, Ohio and Valley Knox of Beaverton.<br>
Funeral services were held at theAdvent church at Edenville Thursday afternoon, Jan. 17, at 2:30 o'clock, conducted by Rev. Perry Hoover, followed by burial in the Edenville cemetery. Mrs. Dundas was born at the old lumber camp now known as Knox Corners, and was the first white child born in Tobacco township. Mrs. Dundas, her sister, now Mrs. John Rich, and her brother, Jay Dow, now of Toledo, Ohio, were the only three school children in Tobacco township when the district was first organized. They found their way by a trail of trees one half the distance to the school house. The nearest neighbors were nine miles away. All the lumberman of early days stopped here, as it was the only stopping place this side of Edenville. She was always very healthy and had never spent an entire week away from the township in which she was born.<br>
It can well be said of her that she was a true wife, a loving mother, who gave her life for her family. She was a good neighbor who never failed, day or night, when her services were needed. She will be greatly missed in her community. She fought the fights, she kept the faith, Her fame shines bright and clear, And her memory lives in all our hearts, Which will hold it ever dear. <br>

"Henry Dowe was the parish clerk at Runham. In his will dated 9 December 1612 (ANW 1612/3, 198 Dewpleet)[?], Henry Dowe gave to Elizabeth his wife the use of all his messuages, houses, lands, tenements, which had been given to him by his father Thomas Dowe. After her death his son Thomas was to inherit the property, paying to his sisters Mary and Frances 10 pounds each. He named his sons Henry and Edward and appointed his brother-in-law William Marche supervisor to aid his wife who was to be executrix.<br>
An inquisition was taken at Watton, Norfolk, 19 April 1614 'after the death of Henry Dowe, who had died seized of a close of arable land called le Wenge close in Runham containing by estimation 14 Acres held of the King, of the annual value of 13s, 4d... on messuage and 11 acres of land in Runham and Maultbye and Thrigby held of Thomas Perney, knight of his manor of Strumpsall... at the time of his death his son and heir was Thomas Dowe a minor aged 13 years and 3 months' (PRO, Chancery Inquisitions Post Mortem, Series II, 344, no. 94)."<br>

OBITUARY<br>
Doyle, WWII soldier, pacifist and protester<br>
His experiences in the war had a profound influence on his view of life<br>
HOUSTON,TEXAS<br>
Richard Doyle, whose experiences during World War II led him to become a pacifist and war protester, died Thursday in an assisted living facility in Houston Texas. He was 86.<br>
In Drancy, France, Doyle saw a staging area for those being shipped to the Auschwitz death camp, said his daughter, Danielle Ruth Doyle SoRelle, chief science writer at Baylor College of Medicine and a former medical writer for the Houston Chronicle.<br>
This experience affected Doyle profoundly, she said.<br>
"Man's inhumanity to man was more than he could take," she said. "It made him hate Germans for a while, but he hated to hate."<br>
This reaction also prompted Doyle to protest the Vietnam War, Desert Storm and the current Iraq war, SoRelle said.<br>
"He thought the Iraq war is immoral and illegal, a war of aggression. 'Didn't they learn anything from Vietnam?' " she quoted him as asking.<br>
Although he spent much of his life in the oil business, Doyle came to regard oil as "a substance that is going to ignite a war unless we stop using it," SoRelle said.<br>
Richard Thomas Doyle was born on Feb. 25, 1922, in Bridgeport, Conn., the son of Leo Doyle and Charlotte Simpson Doyle. He grew up in Thomaston, Conn., where he graduated from high school in 1940.<br>
During the war, Doyle served in an engineering unit that landed in France three days after D-Day. He fought in the Battle of the Bulge, in which his unit took heavy casualties, SoRelle said.<br>
After the war, Doyle joined Gulf Oil Corp. as a plant operator in Port Arthur and Port Neches. He was a member and leader of Oil, Chemical and Atomic Workers Local 4-27.<br>
Doyle was proud of his role in uniting white and black unions, SoRelle said.<br>
<br>
"One of his very first speeches in the union hall was about racism," she said.<br>
<br>
Doyle's wife, Ruth Elaine Droddy Doyle, died in 2002. His first child, Richard Thomas Doyle Jr., died in infancy.<br>
<br>
In addition to his daughter and her husband, Paul SoRelle, also a former Chronicle employee, survivors include two other daughters, Marilyn Mae Doyle, M.D., and her husband, Myke Chitty, of Austin, and Janis Doyle Ryan of Port Neches; and a son, James Alan Doyle and his wife, Chrystal Hall Doyle, of Glen Allen, Va.<br>
<br>
A memorial service is scheduled at 10 a.m. today at Bayou Manor, 4141 S. Braeswood in Houston,Texas<br>
