Bette Blanche HILL
<p>
<a name ="I023521"><b>[I023521]</b></a><br />
Bette Hill Vinson 1918 - 2008 Resident of Pleasanton Bette Hill Vinson, died June 20, 2008, while tending her garden, just one month shy of her 90th birthday. Bette and her husband/business partner Lee G. Vinson (1912 - 1992) were born in Eastern Oregon, married in 1936, and have lived in Contra Costa County since 1950. The couple found opportunity in the Seattle area during WWII, invested in real estate, and showed horses in their spare time. With their four children, they moved to Walnut Creek, as trainers at the John Rodgers Arabian Ranch, and in 1954, founded Vinsons' Western Wear, a successful Cowboy clothing and tack shop that served the East Bay ranching and pleasure horse community for ten years. The annexation of Heather Farms as an equestrian center was a project they supported and is a memorial to their vision. In 1965 the Vinsons retired to devote full-time attention to Diablo Arabians on their Danville ranch. Widely known as a horsewoman and breeder of champion Arabian horses, there was none tougher than Bette, with lighter hands or a softer heart. In her quiet, confident manner, she won various North American Trail Ride Conference rides, and swept the Lightweight, Best Conditioned, and the Sweepstakes Divisions of the 1958 Mount Diablo Trail Ride, a grueling eighty-mile ride over the summer-hot/rugged terrain on the Arabian gelding, Shamus. The couple competed in working horse events, concentrating on cutting horse competitions. Both won national championships. Their four children graduated from San Ramon High School in Danville. After Lee's death in 1992, Bette and daughter Debbie Compilli continued their successful boarding and training operation. Bette was a gracious, hard-working lady, a word that may be out of vogue, but perfectly defines her manner with family, friends, or strangers. Her influence will be felt through the generations. She never abandoned her simple country roots but she made her own place in the world. Bette is survived by her children: Bette Lee Collins and husband, Bob, Red Bluff; Terry Vinson and wife, Barbara, Walnut Creek; Linda  Hussa and husband, John, Cedarville; and Debbie Compilli and her husband, Bruce, Pleasanton. Bette will also be missed by her seven grandchildren, seven great-grandchildren, and two great great grandchildren. Memorial services are pending. The family requests the support of: Susan G. Komen Breast Cancer Research, Alzheimer's Assoc. Research.<br>

William Henry Harrison HILTON
<p>
<a name ="I075155"><b>[I075155]</b></a><br />
WILLIAM HENRY HARRISON HILTON, youngest son of John Burgess Hilton, was born Jan. 1, 1830, in the home of his Aunt Jeannette (Mrs. Robt. Arkenburg) in the town of New Scotland, Albany County, N.Y. Leaving the older children, except James, to care for the home, his parents drove back to Albany from Niagara with an ox team, in October 1829, partly in the expectation of sharing further in the estate of his father, Robert Hilton who died in June of that year, but it appears they were not entirely successful, returning in May 1830 with their youngest son.<br>
Uncle "Billy" is said to have walked from Buffalo to Chicago in 1849, but it is more probable that he shipped up the great lakes. However, he bought a yoke of oxen in Chicago and drove or walked to California to seek his fortune in the "gold rush", joining a party following the "Overland Trail" through Nebraska, Colorado, Wyoming and the "Mormon Trail" through Utah, Nevada to Placerville, Calif., where he spent several years in the gold fields. But his greater success was found in stock raising after vainly prospecting from Oregon to Arizona finally settling near Santa Ynez, Santa Barbara County, Calif., where he was employed for many years as "major domo" on the extensive ranchos of Don Luis Burton and Dr. Brinkerhonn. He entered partnership with these gentlemen raising horses for the army during the civil war and later, in 1868-9, shipping or driving from Shasta County to the Salt Lake City, Utah, markets. He became an authority on the raising ands handling of all livestock and his later years were devoted to a ranch of his own, known as the "Bee Rock" on the San Maroos Trail between Santa Barbara and Santa Ynez.<br>
In 1869 he married Dolores, daughter of Don Francisco Cavalleri, a native of Italy, who was born in Santa Barbara County, California, March 29, 1849 and whose mother was a prominent family of Spanish descent, and is said to have planted the famously large grape-vine which was still thriving in 1920 in front of the school in Carpenteria. Ten years or so later it had disappeared and was replaced by the school flagpole. About the time of his marriage, perhaps on that account, he finally found the opportunity to communicate with his family folks back east, who had long since given him up for lost. In 1903 he retired to Santa Barbara, where he died Jan. 6, 1905. His wife survived him until Feb. 4, 1915.<br>
