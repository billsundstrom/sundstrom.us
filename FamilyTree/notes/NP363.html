Morphia of MELITENE
<p>
<a name ="I015200"><b>[I015200]</b></a><br />
From Wikipedia<br>
<br>
Morphia of Melitene, or Morfia, (died c. 1126) was the wife of Baldwin II, king of the crusader Kingdom of Jerusalem.<br>
<br>
Morphia was the daughter of an Armenian nobleman named Gabriel (or Khoril, in Armenian), the ruler of the city of Melitene. Although ethnically Armenian, the family practised the Greek Orthodox faith. Melitene was a neighbour of the crusader County of Edessa, and Gabriel soon became a vassal of the county. The future Baldwin II of Jerusalem was also count of Edessa after 1100, and he consolidated his position in the county by marrying Morphia around 1101. Gabriel, who was very wealthy, gave 50 000 gold bezants as a dowry. Baldwin and Morphia had four daughters: Melisende, Alice, Hodierna, and Ioveta.<br>
<br>
When Baldwin became King of Jerusalem in 1118, Morphia and her children remained in Edessa. After the Muslim victory at the Battle of Ager Sanguinis in 1119, Baldwin returned to the north to respond to the threat. After having secured the crusader territories, he returned home in 1120 with his family, and Morphia was finally crowned as queen. Morphia went back north when Baldwin was taken captive while patrolling the borders of Edessa in 1123, and helped ensure his release by offering their young daughter Ioveta as a hostage.<br>
<br>
According to the Melisende Psalter, Morphia died on October 1, but the year is unknown; it was either 1126 or 1127, more likely 1126. With no male heir, Baldwin II designated Melisende, his oldest daughter, as his heir, and married her to Fulk V of Anjou. Two of their other daughters also married influential crusader lords: Alice married Bohemund II of Antioch, and Hodierna married Raymond II of Tripoli. Ioveta became a nun.<br>
<br>
Morphia was probably partially responsible for the Greek and Armenian cultural influences that appeared in the Latin kingdom. Art from the kingdom, such as the Melisende Psalter, often shows a mixture of eastern and western styles, just as the western crusaders had begun to accustom themselves to eastern culture. Morphia was buried at the abbey of St. Mary Josaphat, just outside of Jerusalem.<br>

Coenwulf of MERCIA
<p>
<a name ="I005601"><b>[I005601]</b></a><br />
From Wikipedia<br>
<br>
Coenwulf (or Cenwulf) (died 821) was King of Mercia from 796 to 821.<br>
<br>
Coenwulf became king after the death of Ecgfrith, the son of Offa, in December 796; given the very brief duration of Ecgfrith's rule (five months), it is possible that he was killed by Coenwulf, who subsequently became king despite the fact that his only claim to the throne was his descent from Cenwalh, an obscure younger brother of the past kings Penda and Eowa, who had lived 150 years earlier.<br>
<br>
Kent, which had been ruled as a Mercian territory since 785, rose in rebellion in 796. Coenwulf won the Church's backing for a reconquest of Kent, in large part due to its dissatisfaction with the exile of the pro-Mercian Archbishop of Canterbury, Aethelheard, who fled in the face of the rebellion. In 798, Coenwulf invaded Kent, deposed and captured the rebel king Eadbert Praen, and made his own brother Cuthred king of Kent. Cuthred reigned in Kent from 798 to 807; when he died, Coenwulf took control of Kent in name as well as fact.<br>
<br>
Similar events took place in 796 in East Anglia (ruled directly by Mercia since 794), where Eadwald became king after a rebellion in the wake of Offa's death. However, Coenwulf regained control of East Anglia within a few years.<br>
<br>
Throughout his reign, Coenwulf waged war against the Welsh of Powys and Gwynedd; in 798, the ruler of Gwynedd, Caradog ap Meirion was killed, probably in battle against the Mercians. Further campaigns against the Welsh are recorded in 816 and 818.<br>
<br>
In 799, Coenwulf entered into a peace treaty with the West Saxons under Beorhtric, who had been installed as King of Wessex by Offa in 786; Beorhtric remained friendly to Mercian interests until his death in 802, when the less submissive Egbert became king. Coenwulf may have instigated the failed raid into Wessex of Ælthelmund, earl of the Hwicce, upon the accession of Egbert. However, the major conflict that established the supremacy of Wessex at the expense of Mercia would not occur until the 820s, after Coenwulf's death.<br>
<br>
In 801, Mercia was invaded by Eardwulf of Northumbria, but peace was made between the two sides.<br>
<br>
It was during Coenwulf's reign that the archbishopric of Litchfield was abolished, probably before 803, as the Hygeberht who signed as an abbot at the council of Cloveshoe in that year was presumably the former archbishop. Coenwulf appears from the charters to have quarrelled with Wulfred of Canterbury, who was consecrated in 806, and the dispute continued for several years. It was probably only settled at Cloveshoe in 825, when the lawsuit of the daughter and heiress of Coenwulf, Cwoenthryth, against Wulfred was terminated.<br>
<br>
Coenwulf died in 821, and was succeeded by his brother Ceolwulf I.<br>
