After two year break, Povolny returns to Eau Claire<br />
By Erica Dakins Thursday, Dec. 11, 2003<br />
Imagine warm, sunny days spent at the beach, surfing the cerulean blue waves, seeing the tan, blond-haired natives in a diverse culture highlighted by Hollywood and the Golden Gate Bridge.<br />
After experiencing life in California, Mark Povolny chose to leave the warmth behind and return to Eau Claireʼs cold, snowy winters.<br />
From the time Povolny graduated high school in 2000 from Immanuel Lutheran High School, College and Seminary (ILC) in Eau Claire, until he returned in the fall of 2002 as a freshman at the University of Wisconsin-Eau Claire, Povolny had gained life experience and decided what he wanted to do with his life.<br />
After Povolny graduated, he decided to not go straight to college for two reasons, he said.<br />
His first reason, according to him, was because he just did not know where he wanted to go or what he wanted to do.<br />
Povolnyʼs father graduated from seminary at ILC the same time as Povolny graduated high school, so the family would be moving to a new church in a new area, though they did not know where it would be, Povolny said. This provided his second reason, picking out a college was extremely difficult, since he had no idea which part of the country he would call home.<br />
In the April of 2000, the Povolny family found that they would be moving to Mountain View, California and Povolny decided he would go with. While there, he said he gained valuable work experience at Electronic Arts, listed as one of the best 100 companies to work for, according to Fortune Magazine.<br />
After a year of working in California, Povolny decided it was time to continue his education. In order attend the university he chose, UW-Eau Claire, he needed to gain back a resident status. He and his brother Steve Povolny, who also moved back to Eau Claire for college, both worked and lived in Eau Claire for the 12 months required by the UW System for their resident status.<br />
Povolnyʼs mother, Susi Povolny, misses her sons, but she understands why they went back to Wisconsin.<br />
"They had grown up in Wisconsin, and spent their high school years in Eau Claire," She said. "Their church fellowship, and especially with the other kids from high school, was really important to them."<br />
Povolnyʼs approach to college was not the traditional route that most students take, yet this does not make him a non-traditional student, according to UW-Eau Claire requirements.<br />
Students considered to be non-traditional meet one of three requirements, said Bonnie Isaacson, the Adult Student Advisor in the Adult Opportunity Center. They must be married, a parent or over the age of 24, to be considered non-traditional.<br />
After Povolny marries his fiancée, Erin Nolting in May 2005, he will become a non-traditional student. Povolny met Nolting in California while she was on her senior class trip from Immanuel Lutheran High School in Mankato, Minn. The students stayed with families in the area, and Nolting said she met Povolny at church, the day after she arrived. Povolny accompanied her class on a few of the trips, and they stayed in touch after she went back to Minnesota. They started dating at the end of that summer, after both had moved to Eau Claire, and got engaged two years later.<br />
Povolny hopes that when he graduates in 2006 he will be on his way to a career in broadcast journalism. Becoming a national evening news anchor is his dream job, he said.<br />
"I like following the news," Povolny said. "I enjoy staying connected. Being a news anchor plays into my strengths. Iʼm a good speaker and a good writer."<br />

Air Force Band concert set<br />
 <br />
By Elizabeth Gorder<br />
Beacon reporter<br />
April 25. 2008 6:00AM<br />
 <br />
The Air Force Academy Band will perform in Baltic in honor of Cadet Col. Jonny Reynolds, who recently became the first-ever cadet from South Dakota to be named wing commander of the 4,400 cadets at the Air Force Academy.<br />
Reynolds is a 2004 graduate of Baltic High School.<br />
"The band is coming to Baltic as a celebration," high school Principal Jim Aisenbrey said.<br />
The concert will be at 7 p.m. April 29 in Balticʼs high school gym.<br />
The audience could top 1,000 people, school district Superintendent Bob Sittig said.<br />
Reynolds said heʼs looking forward to the event.<br />
"I havenʼt had many opportunities to come home during my tenure here at the Air Force Academy. So I am eager to visit, especially considering the circumstances surrounding my return," he said.<br />
Aisenbrey said the academy contacted the high school to arrange the visit.<br />
There will be a gathering in the high school commons for band members, school staff and Reynoldsʼ family. That gathering is not open to the public.<br />
As wing commander at the Air Force academy, Reynolds commands the 4,400 cadets at the academy, which is located in Colorado Springs, Colo.<br />
He manages a staff of 62 cadets who carry out military duties and is responsible for maintaining military discipline, morale and the well being of each cadet. He also interacts with school officials, military brass, Department of Defense officials and others who visit the academy.<br />
During his time at the academy, Reynolds has been on the superintendentʼs list all semesters and achieved a perfect score of 500 twice in the schoolʼs physical fitness test and was the number one cadet in physical fitness.<br />
At Baltic High School, Reynolds was senior class president, president of the Student Council and National Honor Society, and played football, basketball and baseball. He also was on the schoolʼs golf and cross-country teams.<br />
Maria Reynolds, Jonny Reynolds' mother, said her son always has been goal oriented and decided in junior high that he wanted to go to one of the military academies. That decision was solidified, she said, after the Sept. 11, 2001, disaster.<br />
Reynolds will speak with high school juniors and seniors during his time home.<br />
"I will probably speak on setting and reaching goals, my military service, the Air Force Academy, skydiving, my world travel experiences and answer whatever questions they have," Reynolds said.<br />
Reynolds is on a NCAA national champion skydiving team.<br />
He will stay in Baltic April 27-30.<br />
After Reynolds graduates this spring from the academy, he will intern for the summer at South Dakota Republican Sen. John Thuneʼs office in Washington, D.C.<br />
After his internship, Reynolds will go to Texas to continue his military training.<br />
Reynolds plans to someday return to South Dakota and perhaps run for U.S. Senate.<br />
"Itʼs been one of his long-term goals," Maria Reynolds said.<br />
The concert is free, and four tickets per household will be allowed. For tickets, send a self-addressed stamped envelope to: Argus Leader, USAF Academy Band Concert, P.O. Box 5034, Sioux Falls, SD, 57117.<br />

 <br />
Empress Matilda (1102 - September 10, 1167) is the title by which Matilda, daughter and dispossessed heir of King Henry I of England and his wife Matilda of Scotland (herself daughter of Malcolm III Canmore and St. Margaret of Scotland), is known, in order to differentiate her from the many other Matildas of the period. Matilda is the Latin form of the name "Maud" (or "Maude").<br />
 <br />
When she was seven years old, Matilda was betrothed to Henry V, Holy Roman Emperor, and was sent to Germany in 1111 to begin her training as his consort. Matilda and Henry were married at Worms on January 7, 1114 in a splendid ceremony. In March 1116 Matilda and Henry visited Rome and Tuscany, and she acted as Regent in his absence. The Imperial couple had no surviving offspring; Hermann of Tournai states that Matilda bore a child that lived only a short while. When Henry died in 1125, he left Matilda a childless widow of twenty-three. Her brother William Adelin had perished several years before in the wreck of the White Ship, leaving Matilda the only legitimate heir to the English throne.<br />
 <br />
Matilda returned to England, where her father named her his heir, and arranged another marriage for her. In 1127, she was married again, at Le Mans in Anjou, to Geoffrey of Anjou, who was eleven years her junior. He was nicknamed "Plantagenet" from the broom flower (planta genista) which he took as his emblem, hence the name of the line of English kings descended from him. The marriage was not a happy one, and Matilda separated from him and returned to her father. She returned to Geoffrey in 1131, and they were reconciled. They produced three sons, the eldest of whom, Henry, was born on March 5, 1133. The birth of her second son, Geoffrey, Count of Nantes, in 1134 was difficult and Matilda nearly died in childbed. Her father King Henry came to visit and took "great delight" in his grandsons. King Henry and Geoffrey quarreled, and so when her father died on December 1, 1135 in Normandy, Matilda was with Geoffrey in Anjou.<br />
 <br />
On the death of her father in 1135, Matilda expected to succeed to the throne of England, but her cousin, Stephen of Blois usurped the throne, breaking an oath he had previously made to defend her rights. The civil war which followed was bitter and prolonged, with neither side gaining the ascendancy for long, but it was not until 1139 that Matilda could command the military strength necessary to challenge Stephen within his own realm. Stephen's wife was another Matilda: Matilda, countess of Boulogne. During the war, Matilda's most loyal and capable supporter was her half-brother, Robert of Gloucester.<br />
 <br />
Matilda's greatest triumph came in April 1141, when her forces defeated and captured King Stephen, who was made a prisoner and effectively deposed. Although she now controlled the kingdom, Matilda never styled herself queen but took the title "Lady of the English". Her advantage lasted only a few months. By November, Stephen was free, and a year later, the tables were turned when Matilda was besieged at Oxford but escaped, supposedly by fleeing across the snow-covered land in a white cape. In 1141 she had escaped Devizes in a similarly clever manner, by disgusing herself as a corpse and being carried out for burial. In 1147, Matilda was finally forced to return to France, following the death of Robert of Gloucester.<br />
 <br />
All hope was not lost. Matilda's son, Henry (later, Henry II of England), was showing signs of becoming a successful leader. Although the civil war had been decided in Stephen's favour, his reign was troubled. In 1153, the death of his son Eustace, combined with the arrival of a military expedition led by Henry, led him to acknowledge the latter as his heir by the Treaty of Wallingford.<br />
 <br />
She retired to Rouen, in Normandy, during her last years, where she maintained her own court. She intervened in the quarrels between her eldest son Henry and her second son Geoffrey, but peace between the brothers was brief. Geoffrey rebelled against Henry twice before his sudden death in 1158. Relations between Henry and his youngest brother, William, were more cordial, and William was given vast estates in England. Archbishop Thomas Becket refused to allow William to marry the Countess of Surrey and the young man fled to Matilda's court at Rouen. William, who was his mother's favorite child, died there in January 1164, reportedly of disappointment and sorrow. She attempted to mediate in the quarrel between her son Henry and Thomas Becket, but was unsuccessful.<br />
 <br />
Despite her tenure as "Lady of the English", Matilda was never loved by the people of her native land, who found her too foreign and haughty. She spoke three languages: French, German, and Latin. Even though she gave up hope of being crowned Queen in 1141, her name always preceded that of her son Henry, even after he became king. Matilda died at Rouen, and was buried in the cathedral there; her epitaph reads: "Here lies the daughter, wife, and mother of Henry."<br />

DUNNIDEER FAMILY: The Dunnideer homestead was built by Jocelyn de Baliol,uncle of King John Baliol c. 1260 and probably was given to Tyrees aspayment for military services before 1292, certainly before 1296. Buttradition says the original use of the 300' hill ("dunn") was byGregorythe Great, primarily as a stronghold to protect the Valley ofInsch; and that it became his favorite residence; he died there in 892.Literature mentions "Donudoure" as one of the places King Arthur heldcourt. Today the 550A Dunnideer Main (farm) is located 30 miles fromAberdeen, near the town of Insch and on Chevic Burn (appears in somewritings as the Ouri River). Atop the dunn still are to be found thevitrionized vestiges of an old Pictic fort and abby with some attestingstone pillars ("fortalices") in place around its base. The Baliol castleretains only apart of its foundation and its 6' thick outer limit wallscontaining an entrance door with a sentry lookout -- all preserved underthe National Trust of Scotland. There is also the ruin of another(probable Tyree) homestead, northwest of the Castle. Three ash treesstand in front of this (customarily planted to keep away witches). Themodern dwelling that bears the name was built c.1796, well after theTyree's lost Dunnideer in 1724 as a penalty for their Jacobitecommittments. The property was first passed into the hands of the Leithsof Overhall and later, by purchase, came into the possession of theGordons of Wardhouse and Kildrummy. As a working and profitable farm(primarily for sheep), it has been easily marketable through the years<br />

Floyd Ralph Pierce, 90, of Willmar, Minnesota, and a former longtimeCrookston, Minnesota resident, died Tuesday morning, May 26, 2009, atRice Memorial Hospital in Willmar.<br />
Floyd was born on November 11, 1918 in Barnesville, Minnesota, the son of Harry and Ethel (Arms) Pierce. That happened to be Armistice Day, signaling the end of WWI, so bells and sirens were blaring as Floyd came into the world. In 1930 the Pierce family moved to Crookston where Floyd graduated from Crookston Central High School in 1936. On May 11, 1941 he was united in marriage to Fern Kinshella at Barnesville. The couple made their home in Crookston and together raised three children, Joan, Mike, and Lynn. Floyd began working for the Great Northern Railroad in 1942. His career was interrupted when he entered the U.S. Navy on April 20, 1944. During WWII he served aboard the USS Audubon as a Quartermaster, taking part in the Pacific Theater of Operations. He crossed the Pacific four times from Hawaii to Okinawa, the Philippines, New Guinea, Guadalcanal, and other destinations- transporting U.S. servicemen and women from one deployment to another. Following his honorable discharge from the Navy on January 4, 1946, Floyd returned home to his family and resumed his career. In 1978 he retired from the railroad, which by then was known as the Burlington Northern. Fern passed away on September 17, 2003, and a year later Floyd moved to Willmar, where his daughter and son-in-law, Joan and Bob, were living.<br />
Floyd was a longtime member of Crookston's VFW Post #1902 and American Legion Post #20. He was also a member of Crookston Eagles Aerie #873, and Crookston Masonic Lodge #141 AF & AM. Floyd and Fern had been longtime members of the First Presbyterian Church. He will be remembered for his kind and gentle spirit, and delightful sense of humor. He was passionate about reading, and was a lifelong learner to whom many turned for advice. Floyd will be greatly missed by his family and friends.<br />
Grateful to have been a part of Floyd's life are his daughter and son-in-law, Joan and Bob Glaesman of Willmar, MN; son and daughter-in-law, Mike and Jackie Pierce of Eagan, MN; son-in-law, Neal Stenlund and his wife, Pat, of Goodhue, MN; seven grandchildren and one step-grandchild; five great-grandchildren; and one step-great-grandchild; a brother and sister-in-law, Curtis and Alice Pierce of Benson, MN; and several nieces, nephews, and other relatives. Besides his beloved wife of sixty-two years, Floyd was preceded in death by a daughter, Lynn Stenlund, who died in 1994; his parents, Harry and Ethel; a sister and brother-in-law, Evelyn and Lloyd Johnson; and a brother and sister-in-law, Keith and Marjorie Pierce.

ELLEN PEELSTROM and FRITIOF SUNDSTROM<br />
My grandfather, Fritiof Sundstrom, was born in Gäddvik, Sweden in 1875. Several miles away in the city of Ostergotland, my grandmother, Ellen Euginia Peelstrom, was born four years later. They were destined to meet in a small city named Madrid, in the state of Iowa, in a land called America. They would then marry, have children, and grandchildren, of which I am one, and the last my grandfather was ever to see.<br />
In the year of his birth Minnesota was a vast land of progress and promise. James J. Hill, building the St. Paul and Pacific Railroad lines, laid track at the rate of less than one mile a month. Wheat became the most important agricultural crop, production rising and falling, troubled by invasions of grasshoppers. Lumbering flourished in the north. Immigrants poured into the state from Canada, Norway, Ireland, Scotland, and Sweden, looking for work and finding it in the thick forests of Minnesota. From 1870 to 1890 the majority of immigrants were Scandinavians. But not all of these foreigners were attracted by industry.<br />
Fritiof, nearly always called "Fritz", was a young man in search of a ministry when he set foot on American shores in 1891 at the age of 16. He had been raised as a member of the Lutheran Church of Sweden, being born into that membership as were all babies at that time. The State Church had become all but dead. It needed a revival spirit. That spirit came as a flood in the latter 1800's with the Swedish Free Church movement. Many Swedes, filled with a new spiritual zeal and vitality, and feeling constrained by the stale condition of the State Church, emigrated to the United States during the last decade of the nineteenth century. Fritz Sundstrom was among them.<br />
Fritz settled first in Brookings, SD. Brookings became most memorable for two reasons: it was there he became a citizen of the United States, renouncing all allegiance to King Oscar II of Sweden in the year 1900, the 5th day of April, having lived in the United States for nine years; and it was in Brookings he received his first call to be a minister of a church.<br />
His professional ministry actually began with his ordination. He received a "Minister's Certificate of Ordination" from the First Swedish Free Mission congregation in the city of Beresford, Brooklyn Township, Lincoln County, SD on January 14, 1905. This certified him as: "Called", "Ordained", and "Accredited" as Minister of the Gospel of Jesus Christ, to perform the office and duties of a Clergyman in the United States of America as long as (he) shall be found living and teaching in accordance with the Doctrine of the Lord Jesus Christ, and his Apostles.<br />
An accompanying certificate attests to the fact that Fritiof Sundstrom was "well know as possessing a good Christian character, as a true believer in God, Jesus Christ the Savior, and (had) been proved as well qualified for the ministry". He was ordained by prayer and the laying on of hands by the elders of the Swedish Free Mission Church.<br />
Fritz received his first "call" about three months following his ordination (April 1903) from the Meriden Swedish Free Church in Meriden, Iowa. It was the first of many interim pastorates he would take over the years. Serving as an itinerant pastor was difficult work. Most difficult was pulling up stakes after only a very short time and moving from one city to the next. Pay was extremely low, often times just whatever could be collected at a service offering. Fritz kept a record book of all monies received, with some entries showing as little as $3.50 for the week.<br />
During this time 29 year old Fritz Sundstrom, a handsome, young preacher in Meriden, met 25 year old Ellen Peelstrom, a spectacled, lovely woman with wavy brown hair, who attended the Free Church in Madrid, Iowa, a few miles away.<br />
Ellen Eugenia Peelstrom was born in Ostergotland, Sweden on April 21, 1879. She immigrated to America in 1895 at the age of 16, arriving by boat in Connecticut and soon moved to Des Moines, IA to live with her brother Carl, a professional photographer. To support herself she worked as a cook in the governor's mansion during the Cummings Administration in 1904.<br />
1904 was a busy year for Fritz. He decided to leave Iowa for one year of education and training at the Swedish Bible Institute in Chicago, Illinois. This was later to become the Moody Bible Institute. He was fortunate to receive an offer of employment to preach every third Sunday in nearby Stillman Valley Free Church for as long as he was in school.<br />
The Swedish Bible Institute offered about seventeen major subjects of study to its Bible students. Besides Bible courses, students were required to enroll in classes of the English language, arithmetic, literature as an art form and concentrating on fiction, common geography, nature lessons, and history.<br />
Fritz enrolled in a number of varied Bible courses. Bible geography, the Bible as history, which included study in the Old Testament, New Testament, and a study of the time of the Apostles. He also took classes on Bible teachers, interpretation and preaching, and a class on Bible insights, which included: a. What the Bible is.; b. How it was written.; c. Bible commentaries.; and d. Bible customs. He satisfactorily completed his studies and graduated from the Institute May 12, 1905. Prior to this graduation he had received a call to a pastorate in Colorado which he accepted May 22, 1905 and left Chicago for the city of Greeley.<br />
By the fall of 1905 his separation from Ellen Peelstrom had become an unbearable burden and he sent for her to become his wife, which she did on September 5th in Denver, CO.<br />
In that year, Minnesota, which was to become the Sundstrom's future and final home, was in a transitional period. It was awakening to the twentieth century. Governor Van Sant feared defeat for reelection by up-and-coming candidate John A. Johnson. Reforms in many areas, including the juvenile court system, were instituted, and the Minnesota Highway Commission was set in motion to control the ever increasing number of "horseless carriages" being driven on Minnesota's roads. Fritz and Ellen were never to own an automobile throughout their lives.<br />
While living in Colorado, Ellen gave birth to the first of their five daughters, Hildur Aldina, on July 11, 1906. Fritz had seen the word "Aldina" at the top of an English writing tablet in school and decided upon it as a name for his first child. Their second daughter, Naomi Eugenia, was born a year later on August 16, 1907.<br />
Itinerant preaching kept the family moving and growing for the next several years. It seemed each new pastorate brought a new baby girl. Ruth Margaret was born May 22, 1910 in Beresford, SD shortly after their daughter, Naomi, died at age 2 and a half of diphtheria. Frances Marie was born in Windom, MN January 10, 1912 and Florence Elizabeth on June 16, 1915 in Trade River, WI.<br />
 In 1919, Fritz became a District Superintendent of the Swedish Free Church in Wisconsin. This job entailed much traveling either walking, using the family horse and buggy, or quite often utilizing the Minneapolis, St. Paul and Sault Sainte Marie Railroad which issued Fritz a minister's pass that entitled him to free railroad passage between all stations in Wisconsin.<br />
As District Superintendent he started Free Church works in Wisconsin, Minnesota, and South Dakota, often meeting in schoolhouses, and the homes of farmers to preach and hold prayer meetings until church buildings could be erected. He continued as District Superintendent until 1924.<br />
In 1924, Fritz and Ellen with their four daughters headed west to Salt Lake City, Utah to begin a Free Church ministry there. The Evangelical Free Church had established a work among the Mormons in 1885, which contained a large Swedish population, largely through the works of Reverend Edw. Thorell. Fritz served the Lord there for three years, resigning in 1927 to return eastward to Minnesota<br />
Minnesota had Theodore Christianson as it's governor in 1927. The people of the state marveled at the medical and surgical expertise of the Mayo brothers in Rochester, and the state's Republicans were gearing up to place their votes for Herbert Hoover in the presidential election of1928.<br />
Minneapolis became the Sundstrom's permanent home. They moved from rented house to rented house, first 1518 - 18th Avenue South, and then 2306 - 11th Avenue South, to others. Fritz continued as an itinerant preacher during the years of 1927 to his retirement at age 65 in 1940. He would preach occasionally at the First Free Church in Minneapolis and as interim pastor and guest speaker in churches in and out of town.<br />
Ellen and Fritz owned their first home after retirement, a small but comfortable house at 4337 - 15th Avenue South, not far from Lake Nokomis, with two small pine trees to either side of the front steps. It was in this house Fritz lived alone following Ellen's death on February 27, 1951, at the age of 71. The following year on March 22, Fritiof Sundstrom died in his sleep of a heart attack at the age of 76.<br />

Son of Odo FitzGeoffry. In 1047 he saved young Duke William of Normandy'slife when he was fleeing from Valognes, where the conspirators of theCotentin were attempting to capture him. Hubert placed him on a freshhorse and giving misleading information to his pursuers, commanded histhree sons, Ralph, Hubert and Adam (4th son Eudo apparently too young) toconduct him to Falaise, which they succeeded in doing. Later on, DukeWilliam assembled some of his principal lords at a time when he wanted amessenger to go to England to attend Edward the Confessor, on behalf ofhis claim to the English crown. It was considered a very dangerousundertaking and Hubert alone of those present volunteered to make theperilous journey, on which he immediately departed. He returned with thepromise of the kingdom for William with tokens confirming it from KingEdward. Prior to 1060 he witnessed a donation to the abbey of Saint-Peterat Chartres. Hubert attended the Duke at the conquest of England with hissons, and a short ti me later was sent to Normandy to quell a disturbancethere and was not heard of again in England. He died bef. 1086, as he isnot mentioned in Domesday. His 4 sons were magnificently rewarded by theConqueror and appear in that survey. [Falaise Roll, pp. 16-17]<br />

Ichabod, youngest son of Elijah, Sen., born August 24, 1776, removed to Park Hill, and occupied the house built by Josiah Phelps. He married Mary Clapp, daughter of Jonathan Clapp. He was a prominent member of the church, an active, working Christian, ever ready to stand in his lot and bear his part in the work of the church. Often the weekly neighborhood prayer meeting was held at his house, and when it was at the schoolhouse, or elsewhere, he was almost always present, ready, by prayer and exhortation, to contribute to the interest and profit of the occasion. These neighborhood gatherings for social prayer and conference were a source of great spiritual profit, to those who attended them, and through them to the whole district, as well as to the church. His death occurred in 1 844. His children were Horace, Ichabod Strong, Edmund, J. Rockwell, and Russell M. Horace owned and worked a tannery for a number of years, at Roberts Meadow, in Northampton; afterwards removed to Syracuse, N. Y., and now resides in St. Louis, Mo. I. Strong resides in Brooklyn. Edmund graduated at Williams College in 1836; studied theology at East Windsor, Ct.; was ordained minister of the gospel; labored as a home missionary for many years in Weston, Mo.; afterwards was pastor of a church in St. Louis, Mo, and has been Secretary of the Home Missionary Society in that State. He is a faithful laborer, and has been the means of great good to those for whom he has labored. J. Rockwell lived on the old homestead for many years, but finally sold it, and removed to South Hadley, where he now resides. Russell M. graduated at Williams College in 1841, and was one of the early and efficient teachers of Williston Seminary. He afterwards removed to Georgia, where he was employed as Principal of a female educational institution, located at Athens.

Garcia Ramirez, called the Restorer, was Lord of Monzon, and in 1134became King of Navarre.<br />
 <br />
He was born in the 1110s as the grandson of a bastard son of Garcia V of Navarre. His parents were Ramiro Sanchez de Monzon (of bastard Navarrese royal ancestry) and Cristina Rodriguez Diaz de Vivar, daughter of Rodrigo Diaz de Vivar, El Cid Campeador, the recent lord of Valencia.<br />
 <br />
When Aragon, which had from 1076 taken over in Navarre, lost its warrior king Alfonso I of Aragon and fell into a succession crisis, Garcia managed to wrest Navarre from his also illegitimate Aragonese cousins in 1134.<br />
 <br />
He was obliged to surrender Rioja to Castile in 1136, and to declare himself a vassal of King Alfonso VII of Castile.<br />
 <br />
Garcia was utterly incompetent, and at various times was dependent upon the revenues of churches and convents. He was succeeded in 1150 by his more competent son, Sancho VI of Navarre (the Wise).<br />

GEORGE ARGALE HARROP, JR., M.D.<br />
BY CHARLES R. AUSTRIAN, M.D.<br />
The especial charm of this Association is at once its one shortcoming, for not only does it bring together men with a common interest but, more than do most similar organizations, it welds more closely the bonds of friendship between kindred spirits. Its fostering of social exchange and of camaraderie makes harder the inevitable depletion of its roster by time, a fact emphasized anew as we note now the death of George Argale Harrop, Jr.<br />
Born in Peru, Illinois, on November 5, 1890, the son of George Argale and Mary Belle Cole Harrop, he received his preliminary education in that town, then spent two years at the University of Wisconsin (1908-10), after which he transferred to Harvard University, where he received the degree of Bachelor of Arts in 1912. Following his graduation from college, he entered the Medical School of the Johns Hopkins University and was awarded his Doctorate of Medicine in 1916. From 1916 to 1920, he served as Intern and Assistant Resident in Medicine at the Johns Hopkins Hospital, and then for the year 1920-21, was engaged in investigative work with Professor Krogh in Copenhagen. From 1921 to 1923, he was Resident Physician and Instructor in Medicine at Columbia University, and in 1923- 24 he was an Associate Professor of Medicine at Peking Union Medical College, from which post he returned to Hopkins, where he remained as Associate and then as Associate Professor of Medicine from 1925 to 1938. During those years he demonstrated, in addition to his interest in clinical medicine, an especial aptitude for research in and for the teaching of disorders of nutrition and of metabolism, published many papers and established a reputation as an outstanding investigator. His busy schedule allowed time in 1921 for a trip to Peru under the auspices of The Royal Society leading to the establishment of good contacts that he renewed in 1939 when he journeyed again to Mexico and South America.<br />
In 1938, Harrop left Baltimore and his direct affiliation with academic medicine to become Director of Research of the Squibb Institute for Medical Research at New Brunswick, N. J., a post he held until his death. In this capacity, large administrative responsibilities left him relatively little time personally to carry on investigative work and deprived him of the opportunity to conduct clinics or classes, but his wealth of information was helpful to his associates, his enthusiasm and creative capacity were stimulating to them and he directed well the fruitful labor of many colleagues in diversified fields. Arduous duties and a crowded schedule left him little time or inclination for hobbies and he found his chief relaxation and pleasure in his home with his wife, Esther Caldwell, to whom he was married in China in 1924 and with their three sons and one daughter.<br />
He belonged to many scientific societies at home and abroad, was a member of several honorary fraternities and was the recipient of many honors. He was shy but genial, and, although by nature modest and retiring, was ready at all times not merely to express but stoutly to champion his views. He was tolerant and above all else kind, with a simplicity almost unique in one so wise as he. He was gregarious, an entertaining companion, a good friend. Although hampered by imperfect health for some time, he continued stoically to carry on without stint of effort, sustained or driven by his intellectual curiosity, ambition, determination and by an energy that was not to be denied. From January, 1945, on, grave symptoms prevented continuing activity and caused the invalidism that checked him until his death on August 4 of that year.<br />
A member of this Association since 1933, his companionship was enjoyed, his friendship esteemed and his passing is recorded with sorrow. Truly, in the words of the poet "he was lost too soon."<br />

She was the youngest daughter of Sancho VI of Navarre (who died 1194) and Sancha of Castile, the daughter of Alfonso VII.<br />
 <br />
Her eldest brother Sancho VII of Navarre succeeded their father as king of Navarre. Her brother Ramiro of Navarre was Bishop of Pamplona, and her elder sister Berengaria of Navarre married Richard I of England and Aquitaine, the northern neighbor of their kingdom.<br />
 <br />
She herself was married to Count Theobald III of Champagne, who died already in 1201. At that time, she was pregnant, and then gave birth to son, who immediately became count Theobald IV of Champagne (1201-53). Blanca ruled the county as regent until Theobald turned 21 in 1222.<br />
 <br />
The regency was plagued by a number of difficulties. Blanca's brother-in-law, count Henry II had left behind a great deal of debt, which was far from paid off when Theobald III died.<br />
 <br />
Further, their son Theobald's legitimacy was not unquestioned, and his right to the succession was challenged by Henry's daughter Philippa and her husband, Erard I of Brienne, count of Ramerupt and one of the more powerful Champagne nobles.<br />
 <br />
The conflict with the Briennes broke into open warfare in 1215, and was not resolved until after Theobald came of age in 1222. At that time Theobald and Blanca bought out their rights for a substantial monetary payment.<br />
 <br />
Blanca had also arranged the dowry to Henry II's elder daughter Alice, when she was married to the young king of Cyprus. In 1230's, in order to settle with Alice, Theobald IV had to sell his overlordship over the counties of Blois, Sancerre, and Chateaudun to the king of France.<br />
 <br />
Blanca's brother Sancho VII of Navarre was the last male-line descendant of the first dynasty of kings of Navarre, the Pamplona dynasty, and was childless.<br />
 <br />
Sancho went into retirement ("el Encerrado") at some point, when Blanca took administration of the kingdom.<br />
 <br />
Blanca died in 1229, her brother in retirement remaining as king of Navarre and her son Theobald continuing as count of Champagne.<br />
 <br />
Their eldest sister, Berengaria, queen of England, died 1232 childless, thus leaving Sancho alone as children of Sancho VI. When he died, Blanca's son Theobald of Champagne was recognized as the next monarch in Navarre in 1234. Count Theobald IV thus succeeded his uncle Sancho VII of Navarre as king of Navarre.<br />
 <br />
Theobald had married twice during Blanca's lifetime, but had not succeeded in producing children. Blanca went to grave not seeing future for her dynasty. However, afterwards, Theobald had children in his third marriage.<br />

Marie de France, or Marie Capet, Countess of Champagne (1145 - March 11,1198), was the elder daughter of Louis VII of France and his first wife,Eleanor of Aquitaine.<br />
 <br />
She was an older sister of Alix of France. She was an older paternal half-sister to Marguerite of France, Alys, Countess of the Vexin, Philip II of France and Agnes of France. She was also an older maternal half-sister to William, Count of Poitiers, Henry the Young King, Matilda of England, Richard I of England, Geoffrey II, Duke of Brittany, Leonora of Aquitaine , Joan Plantagenet and John of England.<br />
 <br />
Her parents divorced in 1152, and the custody of Marie and her sister Alix was awarded to their father, King Louis. Their mother Eleanor remarried to King Henry II of England, and so left France. In 1160, when her father King Louis married Adele of Champagne, he betrothed both Marie and Alix to Adele's brothers. After her betrothal, Marie was sent to the abbey of Avenay in Champagne for her education.<br />
 <br />
In about 1164, Marie married Henry I, Count of Champagne. They had four children:<br />
   1. Scholastique of Champagne (died 1219), married William V of Macon<br />
   2. Henry II (1166-1197)<br />
   3. Marie of Champagne (died 1204), married Baldwin I of Constantinople<br />
   4. Theobald (1179-1201)<br />
 <br />
After Henry I's death in 1181, Marie acted as regent from 1181 to 1187, when her son Henry came of age. However, Henry II left to go on Crusade, and so Marie once again served as regent in his absence from 1190 to Henry's death in 1197. She retired to the nunnery of Fontaines-les-Nones near Meaux, and died there in 1198.<br />
 <br />
Marie is remembered today mainly for her role in the heresy that was the target of the Albigensian Crusade. She was also a patron of literature, including Andreas Capellanus, who served in her court, and Chretien de Troyes. In her court, the institution of marriage was repelled and forbidden for being contrary to the rule of love.<br />

Theobald III of Champagne (d. 1201) was Count of Champagne from 1197 to1201.<br />
 <br />
Theobald was the younger son of Henry I of Champagne and Marie, a daughter of Louis VII of France. He succeeded as Count of Champagne in 1197 upon the death of his older brother Henry II.<br />
 <br />
In 1198, Pope Innocent III called the Fourth Crusade. There was little enthusiasm for the crusade at first, but in 1199 various nobles of France gathered at Theobald's court for a tournament, including the preacher Fulk of Neuilly. There, they "took the cross," and elected Theobald their leader, but he died the next year and was replaced by Boniface of Montferrat.<br />
 <br />
Theobald married Blanche of Navarre, and was succeeded by his posthumous son by Blanche, Theobald IV. She was to rule as regent for the following 21 years, during which the succession was contested by Theobald's nieces, Alice and Philippa of Champagne.<br />

Henry I of Champagne (died March 17, 1181), known as "the Liberal", wascount of Champagne from 1152 to 1181.<br />
 <br />
He was the eldest son of Count Thibaut II of Champagne (who was also Count Thibaut IV of Blois). On his father's death, Henry chose to take Champagne, leaving the family's older holdings (including Blois, Chartres, Sancerre, and Chateaudun) to his younger brothers. At the time this may have been surprising, for the other territories were richer and better developed. Henry must have had forseen the economic possibilities of Champagne, and it is during his rule that the county achieved its high place as one of the richest and strongest of the French principalities.<br />
 <br />
Henry established orderly rule over the nobles of Champagne, and could fairly reliably count on the aid of some 2,000 vassals, which just by itself made him a power few in France could equal. This order in turn made Champagne a safe place for merchants to gather, and under the count's protection the Champagne Fairs became a central part of long-distance trade and finance in medieval Europe.<br />
 <br />
In addition, the count's court in Troyes became a renowned literary center.<br />
 <br />
Henry married Marie of Champagne, daughter of Louis VII of France and Eleanor of Aquitaine. He was succeeded by their eldest son Henry II of Champagne. After Henry II became king of Jerusalem, the younger son Thibaut III became count.<br />

Fulk III (972-1040), called Nerra (that is, le Noir, "the Black") after his death, was count of Anjou from 987 to 1040. He was the son of Geoffrey Greymantle and Adelaide of Vermandois.<br />
 <br />
He was the founder of the Angevin dynasty. He had a violent nature and performed both cruelties and acts of penitence; he made four pilgrimages to the Holy Land. In probably his most notorious act, Fulk Nerra had his first wife (and cousin) Élisabeth de Vendôme burned to death at the stake in her wedding dress, after discovering her with a goatherd in December 999.<br />
 <br />
Erdoes says of him: "Fulk of Anjou, plunderer, murderer, robber, and swearer of false oaths, a truly terrifying character of fiendish cruelty, founded not one but two large abbeys. This Fulk was filled with unbridled passion, a temper directed to extremes. Whenever he had the slightest difference with a neighbor he rushed upon his lands, ravaging, pillaging, raping, and killing; nothing could stop him, least of all the commandments of God."<br />
 <br />
He fought against the claims of the counts of Rennes, defeating and killing Conan I of Rennes at the Battle of Conquereuil in 992. He then extended his power over the County of Maine and the Touraine. All of his enterprises came up against the no less violent ambition of the Odo II of Blois, against whom he made an alliance with the Capetians. In 1025, after capturing and burning the city of Saumur, Fulk reportedly cried, "Saint Florentius, let yourself be burned. I will build you a better home in Angers." But when the transportation of the saint's relics to Angers proved difficult, Fulk declared that Florentius was a rustic lout unfit for the city, and sent the relics back to Saumur.<br />
 <br />
Fulk also commissioned many buildings. From 987 to 1040, while he was count of Anjou and fighting against the Bretons and Blois, protecting his territory from Vendôme to Angers and from Angers to Montrichard, he had more than a hundred castles, donjons, and abbeys constructed. These numerous pious foundations, however, followed his many acts of violence against the church.<br />
 <br />
Fulk died in 1040 in Metz.<br />

Morphia of Melitene, or Morfia, (died c. 1126) was the wife of Baldwin II, king of the crusader Kingdom of Jerusalem.<br />
 <br />
Morphia was the daughter of an Armenian nobleman named Gabriel (or Khoril, in Armenian), the ruler of the city of Melitene. Although ethnically Armenian, the family practised the Greek Orthodox faith. Melitene was a neighbour of the crusader County of Edessa, and Gabriel soon became a vassal of the county. The future Baldwin II of Jerusalem was also count of Edessa after 1100, and he consolidated his position in the county by marrying Morphia around 1101. Gabriel, who was very wealthy, gave 50 000 gold bezants as a dowry. Baldwin and Morphia had four daughters: Melisende, Alice, Hodierna, and Ioveta.<br />
 <br />
When Baldwin became King of Jerusalem in 1118, Morphia and her children remained in Edessa. After the Muslim victory at the Battle of Ager Sanguinis in 1119, Baldwin returned to the north to respond to the threat. After having secured the crusader territories, he returned home in 1120 with his family, and Morphia was finally crowned as queen. Morphia went back north when Baldwin was taken captive while patrolling the borders of Edessa in 1123, and helped ensure his release by offering their young daughter Ioveta as a hostage.<br />
 <br />
According to the Melisende Psalter, Morphia died on October 1, but the year is unknown; it was either 1126 or 1127, more likely 1126. With no male heir, Baldwin II designated Melisende, his oldest daughter, as his heir, and married her to Fulk V of Anjou. Two of their other daughters also married influential crusader lords: Alice married Bohemund II of Antioch, and Hodierna married Raymond II of Tripoli. Ioveta became a nun.<br />
 <br />
Morphia was probably partially responsible for the Greek and Armenian cultural influences that appeared in the Latin kingdom. Art from the kingdom, such as the Melisende Psalter, often shows a mixture of eastern and western styles, just as the western crusaders had begun to accustom themselves to eastern culture. Morphia was buried at the abbey of St. Mary Josaphat, just outside of Jerusalem.<br />

Hugh took the cross for the first crusade, with his brothers Raymond and Berenger-Raymond; He also took part in the crusade of help in 1101<br />

Thomas Rogers became a citizen of Leyden on 25 June 1618 with sponsorsWilliam Jepson and Roger Wilson, and was called a Camlet-merchant. Twoyears later, on 1 April 1620, he sold his house in Leyden before comingto America on the Mayflower.<br />
 <br />
Thomas was the 18th signer of the Mayflower compact.<br />
 <br />
Thomas brought his son Joseph with him on the Mayflower. He died the first winter, but his son survived. William Bradford in his Of Plymouth Plantation writes of Thomas Rogers: "the rest of Thomas Rogers' [children] came over and are married and have many children."<br />
 <br />
In the 1622 poll tax for Leyden are listed his wife Elsgen (Alice), and daughters Lysbeth (Elizabeth) and Grietgen (Margaret), and son John. John Rogers is known to have come to America and married, but the whereabouts of Elizabeth and Margaret remain unknown, though Bradford seems to suggest they came to America and married.<br />

The name of his wife has not been determined. Thomas Rogers was a "Camlet" (a European n fabric of silk & wool) merchant in London and Leyden, Holland. His place in London seems t o have been in the parish of St. Bartholomew the Great where he was a taxpayer, together wit h Christopher Martin, Governor of the Mayflower, and John Hooke. He early became interested in the Pilgrim movement, and was a member of the Leyden, Holand congregation on or before June 25, 1618. He seems to have been fairly well off.<br />
In order to finance his trip on the Mayflower he sold his house on Barbara Lane in Leyden Apr 1, 1620, to a party by the name of Mordeca Cohen for 300 gilders.<br />
Thomas Rogers may be related to George Rogers-Student at Leyden University who lived wit h Thomas Blossom. George Rogers matriculated in Medicine Oct. 27, 1609, then 25. Accompanied by his youngest son Joseph, then about 12 years old, he crossed the ocean in the Mayflower, and became one of the signers of the famous compact. Unfortunately he died at an early age soon after landing at Plymouth in Feb., 1621, and his grave is on "Burial Hill" alongside t hose of his friends who died in that first winter of terrible hardship.<br />
Governor Bradford in his history of Plymouth Plantation states that the other children o f Thomas Rogers came over later.<br />
Incidentally his neighbor in London, Mr. Christopher Martin, was a member of the Merchant Adventurers, and appointed by them Governor of the Mayflower, and also Treasurer. There is good reason to suspect that Thomas Rogers was also a member of the Adventurers. He became a citizen of Leyden in 1618, guaranteed by Wm. Jepson and Roger Wilson.<br />
POSSIBLE CHILDREN OF THOMAS ROGERS BORN ENGLAND; I. Joseph, b.1607/8, II(?)Thomas, b.1600 /8(?) III. John, b.abt.1611, d. bet. August 26, 1691-Sept.20, 1692 IV.(?)William,b.1613(?) V.(? )James, b.1615(?) VI. dau. perhaps VII Noah(?) VIII Probably other children.<br />
NOTE: Of the above children the General Society of Mayflower Descendants has accepted a s clearly established as sons of THOMAS ROGERS, the Mayflower Passenger, I Joseph, b. 1607/8( ?) and III John, b.1611(?). However, William Bradford stated other members of his family came to America, and many good arguments have been, or could be advanced, especially in the case s of IV William, b. 1613(?) and V James, b. 1615<br />
 <br />
Thomas Rogers and his son Joseph came to the colonies at Plymouth Rock on December 21, 1620 aboard the "Mayflower".<br />
It seems that his wife and the rest of the family came over later, there were three other children all born in England or Wales I am not sure which, my dad "Elmer" claimed Wales.<br />
We believed he was one of the one who grew sick and were tended by William Brewster an d Miles Standish. We believe he and the 51 others who perished of scurvy and pneumonia were buried in the mass gravesite called Cole's Hill. They were buried there and all signs remove d to prevent desecration by the Indians. (Can find no further record of this person)<br />

 <br />
Before coming to the New World, Rogers was part of the Leiden congregation in the Netherlands. He came to the Plymouth colony on the Mayflower, in the company of his father, Thomas Rogers. By 1639 he had moved to Duxbury; he is noted as requesting land in that area in 1638 and is named on a committee for the Duxbury highway repair in 1638/39. He is mentioned as "of Duxborrow" in the records of a 1646 land sale. Rogers probably moved very soon after this mention, as he is named lieutenant of Nauset (later Eastham) in 1647. In Eastham, he might have taken up residence with Beriah Higgens, as in his will he mentions that he "lived with him a Greate while." Rogers lived in Eastham until his death.<br />
 <br />
Although his father did not survive the first winter, Joseph's brother John took his chances in the New World and at an unknown date joined his brother in Plymouth. It is uncertain whether Rogers' sisters Elizabeth and Margaret ever came to the colony; they were listed as living in Leiden in 1622.<br />

From Wikipedia<br />
 <br />
Joan of Acre (May 1271 - April 7, 1307) was a daughter of King Edward I of England and his first wife, Eleanor of Castile (1241-1290).<br />
 <br />
Joan got her name from her birthplace, Akko (Acre), Hazofan, Palestine. It differentiates her from an earlier Joan born to the couple, who died in infancy. Joan of Acre was born while her parents were traveling to the Middle East on the Seventh Crusade. At least part of her childhood she spent in France with her maternal grandmother, Jeanne de Dammartin, Countess of Ponthieu. She was betrothed as a child to Hartman, son of King Rudolph I of Germany, but he died in 1282 after drowning in the Rhine.<br />
 <br />
In 1290, at Westminster Abbey, Joan married Gilbert de Clare, 7th Earl of Hertford. He was nearly thirty years her senior. Their four children were:<br />
   1. Gilbert de Clare, 8th Earl of Hertford<br />
   2. Eleanor de Clare<br />
   3. Margaret de Clare<br />
   4. Elizabeth de Clare<br />
 <br />
Following her husband's death in 1295, Joan clandestinely married Ralph de Monthermer, 1st Baron Monthermer, a knight in her household, in 1297. Her father, King Edward I, was enraged by this lowly second marriage, especially since he was arranging a marriage for her to an Italian nobleman. He had Monthermer thrown in prison, and Joan had to plead for the release of her husband. According to the St. Albans chronicler, she told her father, "No one sees anything wrong if a great earl marries a poor and lowly woman. Why should there be anything wrong if a countess marries a young and promising man?" At last her father relented, released Monthermer from prison in August 1297, and allowed him to hold the title of Earl of Gloucester and Hereford during Joan's lifetime. Monthermer and Joan had four children:<br />
   1. Mary de Monthermer, born October 1297. In 1306 her grandfather King Edward I arranged for her to wed Duncan Macduff, 8th Earl of Fife.<br />
   2. Joan de Monthermer, born 1299, became a nun at Amesbury.<br />
   3. Thomas de Monthermer, 2nd Baron Monthermer, born 1301.<br />
   4. Edward de Monthermer, born 1304 and died 1339. He fought in the Scottish campaign in 1335, but spent much of his life in service to his half-sister Elizabeth, who provided for him during his last illness and buried him next to their mother.<br />
 <br />
Joan died in childbirth in 1307 at the manor of Clare in Suffolk, England, a family possession, and was buried at the Augustinian priory there. Her child was stillborn. Miracles were said to occur at her grave, especially the healing of toothache, back pain, and fever.<br />

"I visited Aunt Mary a few weeks ago.  She lives alone in her house in Farmington.  She has not been able to rent this summer to suit her.  I think she will sell her property there when she gets a good chance.  The boys are both living in St Paul now.  Aunt Mary and I made them a visit of a few days.  Thad has a home just out of the city limits.  He is working for the Hoist & Derrick Co, a large works.  Gets from 75 to 80 dollars a month.  They have two girls.  Arthur rents.  He only moved to St Paul this summer.  Is working for the same company.  I dont think Arthur is very rugged.  He had an operration last summer for appendicites.  Was in the Hunter Hospital here two weeks. "<br />

Henry II (March 5, 1133 - July 6, 1189) ruled as Count of Anjou, Duke ofNormandy, and as King of England (1154-1189) and, at various times,controlled parts of Wales, Scotland, eastern Ireland, and western France.His sobriquets include "Curt Mantle" (because of the practical shortcloaks he wore), "Fitz Empress," and sometimes "The Lion of Justice,"which had also applied to his grandfather Henry I. He ranks as the firstof the Plantagenet or Angevin Kings.<br />
 <br />
Following the disputed reign of King Stephen, Henry's reign saw efficient consolidation. Henry II has acquired a reputation as one of England's greatest medieval kings.<br />
 <br />
Biography<br />
He was born on March 5, 1133, at Le Mans to the Empress Matilda and her second husband, Geoffrey the Fair, Count of Anjou. Brought up in Anjou, he visited England in 1149 to help his mother in her disputed claim to the English throne.<br />
 <br />
Prior to coming to the throne he already controlled Normandy and Anjou on the continent; his marriage to Eleanor of Aquitaine in 1152 added her land holdings to his, including vast areas such as Touraine, Aquitaine, and Gascony. He thus effectively became more powerful than the king of France - with an empire (the Angevin Empire) that stretched from the Solway Firth almost to the Mediterranean and from the Somme to the Pyrenees. As king, he would make Ireland a part of his vast domain. He also maintained lively communication with the Emperor of Byzantium Manuel I Comnenus.<br />
 <br />
In August 1152, Henry, previously occupied in fighting Eleanor's ex-husband Louis VII of France and his allies, rushed back to her, and they spent several months together. Around the end of November 1152 they parted: Henry went to spend some weeks with his mother and then sailed for England, arriving on 6 January 1153. Some historians believe that the couple's first child, William, Count of Poitiers, was born in 1153.<br />
 <br />
During Stephen's reign the barons had subverted the state of affairs to undermine the monarch's grip on the realm; Henry II saw it as his first task to reverse this shift in power. For example, Henry had castles which the barons had built without authorization during Stephen's reign torn down, and scutage, a fee paid by vassals in lieu of military service, became by 1159 a central feature of the king's military system. Record keeping improved dramatically in order to streamline this taxation.<br />
 <br />
Henry II established courts in various parts of England, and first instituted the royal practice of granting magistrates the power to render legal decisions on a wide range of civil matters in the name of the Crown. His reign saw the production of the first written legal textbook, providing the basis of today's "Common Law".<br />
 <br />
By the Assize of Clarendon (1166), trial by jury became the norm. Since the Norman Conquest jury trials had been largely replaced by trial by ordeal and "wager of battel" (which English law did not abolish until 1819). Provision of justice and landed security was further toughened in 1176 with the Assize of Northampton, a build on the earlier agreements at Clarendon. This reform proved one of Henry's major contributions to the social history of England. As a consequence of the improvements in the legal system, the power of church courts waned. The church, not unnaturally, opposed this and found its most vehement spokesman in Thomas Becket, the Archbishop of Canterbury, formerly a close friend of Henry's and his Chancellor. Henry had appointed Becket to the archbishopric precisely because he wanted to avoid conflict.<br />
 <br />
The conflict with Becket effectively began with a dispute over whether the secular courts could try clergy who had committed a secular offence. Henry attempted to subdue Becket and his fellow churchmen by making them swear to obey the "customs of the realm", but controversy ensued over what constituted these customs, and the church proved reluctant to submit. Following a heated exchange at Henry's court, Becket left England in 1164 for France to solicit in person the support of Pope Alexander III, who was in exile in France due to dissention in the college of Cardinals, and of King Louis VII of France. Due to his own precarious position, Alexander remained neutral in the debate, although Becket remained in exile loosely under the protection of Louis and Pope Alexander until 1170. After a reconciliation between Henry and Thomas in Normandy in 1170, Becket returned to England. Becket again confronted Henry, this time over the coronation of Prince Henry (see below). The much-quoted, although probably apocryphal, words of Henry II echo down the centuries: "Who will rid me of this turbulent priest?" Although Henry's violent rants against Becket over the years were well documented, this time four of his knights took their king literally (as he may have intended for them to do, although he later denied it) and travelled immediately to England, where they assassinated Becket in Canterbury Cathedral on December 29, 1170.<br />
 <br />
As part of his penance for the death of Becket, Henry agreed to send money to the Crusader states in Palestine, which the Knights Hospitaller and the Knights Templar would guard until such time as Henry arrived to make use of it on pilgrimage or crusade. Henry delayed his crusade for many years and in the end never went at all, despite a visit to him by Patriarch Heraclius of Jerusalem in 1184 and being offered the crown of the Kingdom of Jerusalem. In 1188 he levied the Saladin tithe to pay for a new crusade; the chronicler Giraldus Cambrensis suggested his death was a divine punishment for the tithe, imposed to raise money for an abortive crusade to recapture Jerusalem, which had fallen to Saladin in 1187.)<br />
 <br />
Henry's first son, William, Count of Poitiers, had died in infancy. In 1170, Henry and Eleanor's fifteen-year-old son, Henry, was crowned king, but he never actually ruled and does not figure in the list of the monarchs of England; he became known as Henry the Young King to distinguish him from his nephew Henry III of England.<br />
 <br />
Henry and his wife, Eleanor of Aquitaine, had five sons and three daughters: William, Henry, Richard, Geoffrey, John, Matilda, Eleanor, and Joan. Henry's attempts to wrest control of her lands from Eleanor (and from her heir Richard) led to confrontations between Henry on the one side and his wife and legitimate sons on the other.<br />
 <br />
Henry's notorious liaison with Rosamund Clifford, the "fair Rosamund" of legend, probably began in 1165 during one of his Welsh campaigns and continued until her death in 1176. However, it was not until 1174, at around the time of his break with Eleanor, that Henry acknowledged Rosamund as his mistress. Almost simultaneously he began negotiating to divorce Eleanor and marry Alys, daughter of King Louis VII of France and already betrothed to Henry's son Richard. Henry's affair with Alys continued for some years, and, unlike Rosamund Clifford, Alys allegedly gave birth to one of Henry's illegitimate children.<br />
 <br />
Henry also had a number of illegitimate children by various women, and Eleanor had several of those children reared in the royal nursery with her own children; some remained members of the household in adulthood. Among them were William de Longespee, 3rd Earl of Salisbury, whose mother was Ida, Countess of Norfolk; Geoffrey, Archbishop of York, son of a woman named Ykenai; Morgan, Bishop of Durham; and Matilda, Abbess of Barking.<br />
 <br />
Henry II's attempt to divide his titles amongst his sons but keep the power associated with them provoked them into trying to take control of the lands assigned to them (see Revolt of 1173-1174), which amounted to treason, at least in Henry's eyes. Gerald of Wales reports that when King Henry gave the kiss of peace to his son Richard, he said softly, "May the Lord never permit me to die until I have taken due vengeance upon you."<br />
 <br />
When Henry's legitimate sons rebelled against him, they often had the help of King Louis VII of France. Henry the Young King died in 1183. A horse trampled to death another son, Geoffrey, Duke of Brittany (1158-1186). Henry's third son, Richard the Lionheart (1157-1199), with the assistance of Philip II Augustus of France, attacked and defeated Henry on July 4, 1189; Henry died at the Chateau Chinon on July 6, 1189, and lies entombed in Fontevraud Abbey, near Chinon and Saumur in the Anjou Region of present-day France. Henry's illegitimate son Geoffrey, Archbishop of York also stood by him the whole time and alone among his sons attended on Henry's deathbed.<br />
 <br />
Richard the Lionheart then became king of England. He was followed by King John, the youngest son of Henry II, laying aside the claims of Geoffrey's children Arthur of Brittany and Eleanor.<br />

Elizabeth de Clare (September 16, 1295-1360) was the heiress to the lordships of Clare, Suffolk in England and Usk in Wales. She was one of three daughters of Gilbert de Clare, 7th Earl of Hertford and Joan of Acre, and sister of the infant fourth earl, also Gilbert de Clare. She accompanied her brother Gilbert to Ireland for their double wedding to two siblings -- the son and daughter of the Earl of Ulster. Elizabeth married John de Burgh on September 30, 1308.<br />
 <br />
He was the heir to the Earl of Ulster, and Elizabeth could expect to be a countess. She gave birth to their only child, a son, in 1312; he would become William Donn de Burgh, 3rd Earl of Ulster. Only a year later, her husband John was suddenly killed in a minor skirmish. Now a widow, Elizabeth remained in Ireland until another family tragedy demanded her return.<br />
 <br />
Her brother Gilbert was killed at the Battle of Bannockburn, and as he left no surviving issue and had no brothers, his property was equally divided between his sisters, Elizabeth, Eleanor and Margaret. Suddenly Elizabeth was one of the greatest heiresses in England. Her uncle, King Edward II of England, recalled her to the land of her birth so he could select a husband for her. She left Ireland in 1316, leaving behind her son William. Elizabeth never returned.<br />
 <br />
Edward II placed her in Bristol Castle, but his plans to marry her to one of his supporters were dashed in February 1316, when Elizabeth was abducted from Bristol by Theobald II de Verdun, the former Justiciar of Ireland. He and Elizabeth had been engaged before she was called back to England. She was Lady Verdun for only five months however, for Theobald died in September 1316 of typhoid. He left behind three daughters from a prior marriage and Elizabeth, who was pregnant. She fled to Amesbury Priory, where she stayed under the protection of her aunt Mary, who was a nun there. There she gave birth to her daughter, Isabella de Verdun, named for the queen, in February 1317. Just a few weeks later, Edward II married Elizabeth to Sir Roger D'Amory.<br />
 <br />
D'Amory had been a knight in her brother's service who rose to prominence as a favorite of Edward II. Now married to him, Elizabeth was caught up in the political upheavals of her uncle's reign. She gave birth to another daughter, Elizabeth D'Amorie, in May 1318. Roger was reckless and violent, and made a deadly enemy of his brother-in-law, Hugh the younger Despenser. He switched sides over to Thomas, Earl of Lancaster, and died in March 1322, having been captured by royalist forces. He left Elizabeth defenseless, and she was captured and imprisoned at Barking Abbey with her children.<br />
 <br />
Elizabeth supported her friend, Queen Isabella, when she invaded England and she benefited greatly from the reign of Isabella's son, King Edward III of England. She took a vow of chastity after Roger's death, effectively removing herself from the aristocratic marriage market. She enjoyed a long and fruitful widowhood, becoming patroness of many religious houses. Elizabeth is best remembered for having used much of her fortune to found Clare College, Cambridge.<br />

Richard Og de Burgh, also known as Richard de Burgh, was the 2nd Earl ofUlster, 3rd Lord of Connacht. Born about 1259, died 1326. His name,"Richard Og" meant Richard the Young, probably a reference to his youthwhen he became earl in 1271, or to differenciate him from hisgrandfather, Richard Mor. He was also known as the Red Earl.<br />
 <br />
Richard Og was the most powerful of the de Burgh Earls of Ulster. He was a friend of King Edward I of England, and ranked first among the Earls of Ireland. Richard's wife Marguerite de Guines was the cousin of King Edward's queen. He pursued expansionist policies that often left him at odds with fellow Ango-Irish lords; he sucessfully defeated the King Felim mac Aedh Ua Conchobair of Connacht at the Second Battle of Athenry in 1316.<br />
 <br />
His sister, Egidia de Burgh, was wife of James the Stewart of Scotland. His second son, John de Burgh, was husband to Elizabeth de Clare, a granddaughter of Edward I. Of his daughters, Catherine married the Earl of Desmond; Joan married the Earl of Kildare; Avelina married John Earl of Louth; Matilda married Gilbert de Clare, 8th Earl of Gloucester; and Elizabeth married Robert the Bruce, later Robert I of Scotland. His son John died in 1313, leaving the succession to his infant son, William.<br />

Gilbert de Clare, 7th Earl of Hertford and 3rd Earl of Gloucester was born 2 September 1243, at Christchurch, Hampshire. He was a powerful Norman noble. Also known as "Red" Gilbert de Clare, probably because of his hair colour, he built Caerphilly Castle.<br />
 <br />
Gilbert de Clare was the son of Richard de Clare, Earl of Gloucester and Hertford, and Maud de Lacy, Countess of Lincoln, daughter of John de Lacy and Margaret de Quincy. Gilbert inherited his father's estates he inherited in 1262. He took on the titles, including Lord of Glamorgan, from 1263.<br />
 <br />
Being under age at his father's death, he was a ward of Humphrey de Bohun, 2nd Earl of Hereford. In April 1264, he led the massacre of the Jews at Canterbury, as Simon de Montfort had done in London. Gilbert de Clareʼs castles of Kingston and Tonbridge were taken by the King. However, the king allowed his Countess, who was in the latter, to go free because she was his niece; and on 12 May he and Montfort were denounced as traitors. Two days later, just before the battle of Lewes, on 14 May, Montfort knighted the Earl and his brother Thomas. The Earl commanded the second line of the battle and took the King prisoner, having hamstrung his horse. As Prince Edward had also been captured, Montfort and the Earl were now supreme. On 20 October 1264, the Gilbert and his associates were excommunicated by the Papal Legate, and his lands placed under an interdict.<br />
 <br />
In the following month, by which time they had obtained possession of Gloucester and Bristol, the Prince and the Earl were proclaimed to be rebels. They at once entered on an active campaign, the Earl, in order to prevent Montfort's escape, destroying ships at Bristol and the Bridge over the Severn. He shared the Prince's victory at Kenilworth on 16 July, and in the battle of Evesham, 4 August, in which Montfort was slain. He commanded the second division and contributed largely to the victory. The castle of Abergavenny was committed to his charge on 25 October and on the 29th the honor of Brecknock was added.<br />
 <br />
On 24 June 1268 he took the Cross at Northampton At Michaelmas his disputes with Llewelyn were submitted to arbitration, but without a final settlement. At the end of the year 1268 he refused to obey the King's summons to attend parliament, alleging that, owing to the constant inroads of Llewelyn, his Welsh estates needed his presence for their defense. At the death of Henry III, 16 November 1272, the Earl took the lead in swearing fealty to Edward I, who was then in Sicily on his return from the Crusade. The next day, with the Archbishop of York, he entered London and proclaimed peace to all, Christians and Jews, and for the first time, secured the acknowledgment of the right of the King's eldest son to succeed to the throne immediately. Thereafter he was joint Guardian of England, during the King's absence, and on his arrival in England, in August 1274, entertained him at Tonbridge Castle.<br />
 <br />
His first marriage was to Alice de Lusignan, the daughter of Hugh XI of Lusignan. They were married in 1253, when Gilbert was ten-years-old. She was of high birth, being a niece of King Henry, but the marriage floundered. They produced two daughters before separating in 1267; allegedly, Alice's affections lay with her cousin, Prince Edward. Previous to this, Gilbert and Alice had produced two daughters:<br />
   1. Isabel de Clare (10 March 1262-1333), married (1) Guy de Beauchamp, 10th Earl of Warwick; (2) Maurice de Berkeley, 2nd Baron Berkeley<br />
   2. Joan de Clare (1264-after 1302), married (1) Duncan Macduff, 7th Earl of Fife; (2) Gervase Avenel<br />
 <br />
After his marriage to Alice de Lusignan was finally anulled in 1285, he married Joan of Acre, a daughter of King Edward I of England and his first wife, Eleanor of Castile. By the provisions of the marriage contract, their joint possessions could only be inherited by a direct descendant. On 3 July 1290 the Earl gave a great banquet at Clerkenwell to celebrate his marriage of 30 April 1290 with the Joan of Acre (1272 - 23 April 1307). Thereafter he and she are said to have taken the Cross and set out for the Holy Land, but in September he signed the Barons' letter to the Pope, and on 2 November surrendered to the King his claim to the advowson of the bishopric of Llandaff. In the next year, 1291, his quarrels with the Earl of Hereford about Brecknock culminated in a private war between them. Both were imprisoned by the King, and the Earl of Gloucester, as the aggressor, was fined 10,000 marks, and the Earl of Hereford 1,000 marks. He died at Monmouth Castle on 7 December 1295, and was buried at Tewkesbury, on the left side of his grandfather Gilbert de Clare.<br />

 <br />
King Theobald I of Navarre, also Theobald IV of Champagne (1201-1253), known as "the Troubadour," "the Chansonnier," and "the Posthumous," was Count of Champagne and the King of Navarre from 1235. He was the son of Theobald III of Champagne and Blanca of Navarre who herself was the youngest daughter of king Sancho VI of Navarre. His father died before he was born, and Theobald's mother ruled the county as regent until Theobald turned 21 in 1222.<br />
 <br />
The first half of Theobald's life was plagued by a number of difficulties. His uncle, Count Henry II, had left behind a great deal of debt, which was far from paid off when Theobald's father died. Further, Theobald's legitimacy was not unquestioned, and his right to the succession was challenged by Henry's daughter Philippa and her husband, Erard I of Brienne, Count of Ramerupt and one of the more powerful nobles of Champagne.<br />
 <br />
The conflict with Erard and Philippa broke into open warfare in 1215, and was not resolved until after Theobald came of age in 1222. At that time he bought out their rights for a substantial monetary payment. Some years later, in 1234, he had to spend still more to buy off Philippa's elder sister Alice, Queen of Cyprus. The 1222 settlement did not end Theobald's problems, for in the following years he antagonized Louis VIII.<br />
 <br />
At the death of Louis VIII, his political situation was difficult: he had abandoned the king in his campaigns, there were rumors that he had poisoned him, and he was barred from the coronation of Louis IX. At the beginning of the regency of Blanche of Castile, he abandoned a conspiracy against the French king, which also included Hugues de Lusignan and Pierre Mauclerc, and cemented a strong relation with the regent. Many have hinted at a possible love for Blanche, and he wrote a poetical homage to her. He became so influential at court, that other barons resented him and started a rebellion in 1229.<br />
 <br />
In the following years, however, he antagonized the young king of France Louis IX, which lead to an invasion of Champagne by a group of French barons. They were driven off at the cost of further expense and hardship in Champagne. Thus in order to settle with Alice, Theobald had to sell his overlordship over the counties of Blois, Sancerre, and Chateaudun to the king.<br />
 <br />
He experienced a reversal of his fortunes in 1234, when he succeeded his uncle Sancho VII of Navarre as King of Navarre. This greatly increased his resources (not to mention his prestige), and the remaining years of his rule were far more peaceful and prosperous.<br />
 <br />

King Henry I of Navarre (c. 1244-1274), nicknamed le Gros (that is, theFat), was as Henry III the Count of Champagne and Brie, and, as Henry Iof Navarre, King of Navarre 1270-1274.<br />
 <br />
He was born as the youngest son of Theobald I of Navarre and Champagne (who had in 1234 became King Theobald I of Navarre) and Margaret of Bourbon. In December 1270 Henry succeeded his eldest brother Theobald V of Champagne (Theobald II of Navarre) as King of Navarre and Count of Champagne.<br />
 <br />
His proclamation at Pamplona, however, did not take place till March of the following year, and his coronation was delayed until May 1273. After a brief reign, characterized, it is said, by dignity and talent, he died in July 1274, suffocated, according to the generally received accounts, by his own fat.<br />
 <br />
After his death with no male heir, the male line of the counts of Champagne and kings of Navarre became extinct.<br />
 <br />
In 1269 Henry married Blanche, daughter of Robert, Count of Artois, and niece of King Louis IX. He was succeeded by his only legitimate child, Joan I of Navarre; her 1284 marriage to Philip IV (who became King of France in the same year) united the crown of Navarre to that of France, with Champagne becoming part of the French royal domain.<br />
