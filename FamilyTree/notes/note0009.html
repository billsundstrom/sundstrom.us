Egbert (also Ecgberht or Ecgbert) (c. 770- July 839) was King of Wessex from 802 until his death. Under Egbert, Wessex rose to become the most powerful of the Anglo-Saxon kingdoms, overthrowing the supremacy of Mercia.<br />
 <br />
A somewhat difficult question has arisen as to the parentage of Egbert. Under the year 825, the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle states that in his eastern conquests Egbert recovered what had been the rightful property of his kin. The father of Egbert was called Ealhmund, and we find an Ealhmund, king in Kent, mentioned in a charter dated 784, who is identified with Egbert's father in a late addition to the Chronicle under the date 784. It is possible, however, that the Chronicle in 825 refers to some claim through Ine of Wessex from whose brother Ingeld Egbert was descended.<br />
 <br />
After the murder of King Cynewulf in 786, Egbert may have contested the succession, but the throne went to Beorhtric, an ally of Offa of Mercia. Starting probably in 789, Egbert went into exile after being expelled by Offa and Beorhtric. He spent this exile with the Franks on the continent, and although it is said to have lasted three years, some historians have suggested that this period may have actually lasted thirteen years (789-802), as this would account for Egbert's whereabouts during the whole period preceding Beorhtric's death.<br />
 <br />
Beorhtric ruled subject to the Mercian kings (Offa and, from 796, Coenwulf), and Egbert probably sought greater independence for Wessex. He was acknowledged as king by the West Saxons following Beorhtric's death in 802, but on the same day as his accession to the throne, Ælthelmund, earl of the Hwicce, led a raid into Wessex. Ælthelmund was defeated and killed by Weoxtan, earl of Wiltshire, who also lost his life in the battle.<br />
 <br />
In 815 Egbert ravaged the whole of the territories of the West Welsh, which probably at this time did not include much more than Cornwall; it is probably from his reign that Cornwall can be considered subject to Wessex. The next important occurrence in the reign was the defeat of Beornwulf of Mercia at a place called Ellandun in 825. After this victory, Kent, Surrey, Sussex and Essex submitted to Wessex; while the East Anglians, who rose against Mercian rule and slew Beornwulf shortly afterwards, acknowledged Egbert as overlord. In 829 the king conquered Mercia, and Northumbria accepted him as overlord after refusing to fight his forces at Dore (now a suburb of Sheffield). In 830 he led a successful expedition against the Welsh, and it was in the same year that Mercia regained its independence under Wiglaf, although it is uncertain whether this was achieved through a rebellion or was the result of a grant by Egbert to Wiglaf. In 836 Egbert was defeated by the Danes, but in 838 he won a battle against them and their allies the West Welsh at Hingston Down in Cornwall.<br />
 <br />
Egbert married Redburga, a Frankish princess (possibly a sister-in-law of the emperor Charlemagne), and had two sons and a daughter. Egbert died in about 839, and was buried at Winchester. He was succeeded by his son, King Ethelwulf of Wessex.<br />

 <br />
Ethelwulf was the elder son of King Egbert of Wessex. He was born some time around 800 AD, and succeeded his father as King of Wessex in 839. He fought the invading Danes, whose raids had increased considerably. A major victory for Ethelwulf was archived at "Acleah", probably Ockley. Ethelwulf also defeated Cyngen ap Cadell of Wales together with Mercia. In 855, after his wife's death, he went in a pilgrimage to Rome with a younger son, Alfred. In the return journey in 856, he was deposed by his eldest son, Ethelbald. He died January 13, 858 and was buried first at Steyning and then later transferred to Winchester. The image here is an imaginary portrait drawn by an unknown artist in the 18th century, who probably was the same artist who did many other portraits of other Saxon kings.<br />

Probably early approaching deafness influenced him in the choice of a course in agriculture, and he returned to Hawaii in 1850 an educated farmer.  He bought land in Waialua and engaged in agriculture and grazing till 1867, being the pioneer sugar planter there,  After leaving Waialua he was Superintendent of Grounds at Punahou, taking charge of the boys in their outdoor lessons, as Mr. Rice, his predecessor, had done.

Ealhmund (d. 785?), also known as Alckmund of Wessex, was a King of Kent (c. 784 - c. 785). The 784 entry of the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle mentions Ealhmund as the father of Egbert, but this is uncertain.<br />
 <br />
Ealhmund probably became king following the death of Egbert II around the year 784. There is little historical evidence for his reign. A charter of 784 survives, in which Ealhmund granted land to the Abbot of Reculver. Significantly, this charter makes no mention of Offa of Mercia, who had ruled Kent directly or indirectly for most of the 760s and 770s; we may consider this as evidence that Ealhmund was acting independent of Offa's authority, perhaps as a consequence of a possible Kentish victory at the Battle of Otford in 776.<br />
 <br />
If this was the case, however, it did not last: Offa invaded Kent again around the year 785 and Ealhmund was probably killed in battle. After this, Offa ruled Kent directly.<br />

Edmund FitzAlan, 9th Earl of Arundel (May 1, 1285 - November 17, 1326) was an English nobleman prominent in the contention between Edward II and his barons and second de facto Earl of the FitzAlan line. He was born 1 May 1285 in the Castle of Marlborough. He was the son of Richard FitzAlan, 8th Earl of Arundel and Alisia de Saluzzo (also known as Alice), daughter of Thomas I, marquis of Saluzzo in Italy. He succeeded to his father's estates and titles in 1302. He was summoned to Parliament, 9 November 1306, as Earl of Arundel, and took part in the Scottish wars of that year.<br />
 <br />
Arundel bore the royal robes at Edward II's coronation, but he soon fell out with the king's favorite Piers Gaveston. In 1310 he was one of the Lords Ordainer, and he was one of the 5 earls who allied in 1312 to oust de Gaveston. Arundel resisted reconciling with the King after de Gaveston's death, and in 1314 he along with some other earls refused to help the king's Scottish campaign, which contributed in part to the English defeat at Bannockburn.<br />
 <br />
A few years later Arundel allied with king Edward's new favorites, Hugh le Despenser and his son of the same name, and had his son and heir Richard married to a daughter of the younger Hugh le Despenser. He reluctantly consented to the Despenser's banishment in 1321, and joined the king's efforts to restore them in 1321. Over the following years Arundel was one of the king's principal supporters, and after the capture of Roger Mortimer in 1322 he received a large part of the forfeited Mortimer estates. He also held the two great offices governing Wales, becoming justice of Wales in 1322 and warden of the Welsh marches in 1325.<br />
 <br />
After Mortimer's escape from prison and invasion of England in 1326, amongst the barons only Arundel and his brother-in-law Warenne remained loyal to the king. Their defensive efforts were ineffective, and Arundel was captured and executed at the behest of Queen Isabella.<br />
 <br />
Arundel married Alice Warenne, sister and eventual heiress of John de Warenne, 8th Earl of Surrey or Warenne and daughter of William de Warenne and Joan de Vere. Alice was living in 1330 but died before 23 May 1338. His estates and titles were forfeited when was executed, but they were eventually restored to his eldest son Richard FitzAlan, 10th Earl of Arundel.<br />

Redburga or Raedburh was the wife of king Egbert of Wessex and may have been the sister-in-law of Charlemagne as the sister of his fourth wife, Luitgarde; other sources describe her as his sister (although Charlemagne's only sister was named Gisela) or his great-granddaughter (which would be difficult to accomplish in the forty-six years after Charlemagne's birth) or the daughter of his sister-in-law or his niece. Some genealogies identify her as the granddaughter of Pepin the Short and great-granddaughter of Charles Martel; other scholars doubt that she existed at all, other than as a name in a much later manuscript.<br />
 <br />
She appears in a medieval manuscript from Oxford and is described as "regis Francorum sororia" which translates as "sister to the King of the Franks". More specifically, sororia means "pertaining to someone's sister", hence sister-in-law.<br />
 <br />
According to some accounts, Charlemagne arranged Raedburh's marriage to Egbert in the year 800. Egbert, who had been forced into exile at Charlemagne's court by Offa, King of Mercia, returned to England in 802, where he became King of Wessex and later king of all England. Raedburh's son Ethelwulf succeeded Egbert. Raedburh was also, according to this version of events, the grandmother of Thyra Dannebod Queen of Denmark, who was the wife of the Viking King Gorm "the Old" of Denmark and the mother of Harald Bluetooth Blataand King of Denmark.<br />
 <br />
Confusing matters still further is the rival tradition that Raedburh survived Egbert, who by these accounts died in 811. This individual devoted her life to helping the poor and became known as "Saint Ida of Herzfeld". Among her reported acts of kindness were filling a stone coffin with food each day, then giving it to the poor; she also reportedly founded the church at Hofstadt, Westphalia, and the convent of Herzfeld, sometimes recorded as Herford or Hervorden. where she is buried. She was canonized on November 26, 980, is the patron saint of brides and widows and is frequently depicted either as carrying a church or with a dove hovering over her head.<br />
 <br />
It appears, however, that this Saint Ida was married to a different Egbert, a duke of all Saxony between the Rhine and the Weser appointed by Charlemagne. Unless the Egbert reported in the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle to have regained his throne in Wessex in 802 was, in fact, serving instead as a feudal supporter of Charlemagne in Saxony for many of the years following his return to Wessex, Saint Ida was not the Raedburh who married Egbert of Wessex. Given the irreconcilable differences in the dates of death given for these two Egberts, that conclusion appears more likely.<br />
 <br />
This Egbert and Saint Ida are reported to be the parents of Warin, the abbot of Corvey from 826 to 856, Count Cobbo the Elder, and Addila or Mathilde, the abbess of Herzfeld; others suggest that a Saxon duke Liudolf, grandfather of Henry the Fowler, was also a son of Egbert and Ida and that Mathilde was their granddaughter.<br />

Ranulph "le Briquessart" le Meschin, Vicomte of Bayeux, 1st Earl of Chester:<br />
 <br />
After the Norman conquest of the North of England, he received large grants, including the honor of Appleby, and the city of Carlisle. Some have maintained that he was earl of Carlisle or of Cumberland, but this is probably an error.<br />
 <br />
Ranulph also became the largest landholder in Lindsey due to his marriage (ca. 1093) to a woman referred to as "Countess Lucy", (ca. 1079-1138), daughter of (poss) Turold, Sheriff of Lincoln, and (prob) daughter of William Malet, Seigneur de Graville. Her parentage, and who else she married, have been much disputed.<br />

July 12, 1900 - Obituary. - Mrs. Craig - Died at Cambridge on July 4th,1900, Mrs. Mary Craig, widow of Deacon William Craig, who some twenty-twoyears ago preceded his wife to the better land. Mrs. Craig was a daughterof Mr. Francis Tupper, and was born in Horton, not far from Kentville, onMay 2nd, 1805, and was therefore at the time of her death in her 96thyear. When she was but a child the family removed to Aylesford, where shespent over fifty years of her long life. At about the age of twenty sheengaged in school teaching, which she followed for several years. In 1830she went to Morristown and took charge of the first school organized inthat settlement. Here she met Mr. Craig, then a young man, making a homein what was then almost an unbroken forest. In 1832 they were married andmade their home in what is now one of the finest parts of our County. Mr.and Mrs. Craig were industrious, honest Christians. Their character andhabits gave tone to the whole settlement, the influence of which stillremains. In 1858 the family removed to Cornwallis, where the father andmother resided until removed by death.<br />
 <br />
Mrs. Craig was in many respects a remarkable woman. She possessed those qualities that made her the true woman, the faithful wife, the devoted mother, and the genuine home-maker. In some respects she might be considered a worldly woman in so far as to provide for the support and comfort of her family was concerned. But to any in need she gave generously for her means. "She stretched out her hand to the poor; yea she reached forth her hand to the needy." Indeed "her house was known to all the vagrant train," and food and shelter were always afforded.<br />
Especially was she careful to care for any who professed to be laboring for the Saviour whom she loved. During the early years of her residence at Morristown her house was the home of the clergymen of all denomination while preaching there. With a small house and a numerous family she gave all a hearty welcome because of her love for the Master. Naturally a lover of books she was a great reader, especially of the Bible, always finding time to read a chapter every day, and reading the Book through in course a great number of times. She raised and equipped for life eight children, seven of whom were present at her funeral. One had preceded her to the better land. The four sons acted as pall-bearers, and with loving hearts and careful hands laid the remains of their venerable mother beside the dust of the husband for whom she had so long mourned.<br />
The funeral was large, for although she had outlived her own generation her heart was comparatively young, and both young and old came and to show respect for the memory of "Grandma Craig." Pastor Read conducted the funeral services assisted by Rev. Mr. Simpson and Rev. Mr. Morse. Besides the seven surviving children there are now living thirty-two grandchildren and 35 great-grand-children.<br />

Alfred (b. 849, d. 899)<br />
also spelled AELFRED, byname ALFRED THE GREAT king of Wessex (871-899), a Saxon kingdom in southwestern England. He prevented England from falling to the Danes and promoted learning and literacy. Compilation of the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle began during his reign, c. 890.<br />
 <br />
When he was born, it must have seemed unlikely that Alfred would become king, since he had four older brothers; he said that he never desired royal power. Perhaps a scholar's life would have contented him. His mother early aroused his interest in English poetry, and from his boyhood he also hankered after Latin learning, possibly stimulated by visits to Rome in 853 and 855. It is possible also that he was aware of and admired the great Frankish king Charlemagne, who had at the beginning of the century revived learning in his realm. Alfred had no opportunity to acquire the education he sought, however, until much later in life.<br />
 <br />
He probably received the education in military arts normal for a young man of rank. He first appeared on active service in 868, when he and his brother, King Aethelred (Ethelred) I, went to help Burgred of Mercia (the kingdom between the Thames and the Humber) against a great Danish army that had landed in East Anglia in 865 and taken possession of Northumbria in 867. The Danes refused to give battle, and peace was made. In this year Alfred married Ealhswith, descended through her mother from Mercian kings. Late in 871, the Danes invaded Wessex, and Aethelred and Alfred fought several battles with them. Aethelred died in 871 and Alfred succeeded him. After an unsuccessful battle at Wilton he made peace. It was probably the quality of the West Saxon resistance that discouraged Danish attacks for five years.<br />
 <br />
In 876 the Danes again advanced on Wessex: they retired in 877 having accomplished little, but a surprise attack in January 878 came near to success. The Danes established themselves at Chippenham, and the West Saxons submitted "except King Alfred." He harassed the Danes from a fort in the Somerset marshes, and until seven weeks after Easter he secretly assembled an army, which defeated them at the Battle of Edington. They surrendered, and their king, Guthrum, was baptized, Alfred standing as sponsor; the following year they settled in East Anglia.<br />
 <br />
Wessex was never again in such danger. Alfred had a respite from fighting until 885, when he repelled an invasion of Kent by a Danish army, supported by the East Anglian Danes. In 886 he took the offensive and captured London, a success that brought all the English not under Danish rule to accept him as king. The possession of London also made possible the re-conquest of the Danish territories in his son's reign, and Alfred may have been preparing for this, though he could make no further advance himself. He had to meet a serious attack by a large Danish force from the European continent in 892, and it was not until 896 that it gave up the struggle.<br />
 <br />
The failure of the Danes to make any more advances against Alfred was largely a result of the defensive measures he undertook during the war. Old forts were strengthened and new ones built at strategic sites, and arrangements were made for their continual manning. Alfred reorganized his army and used ships against the invaders as early as 875. Later he had larger ships built to his own design for use against the coastal raids that continued even after 896. Wise diplomacy also helped Alfred's defense. He maintained friendly relations with Mercia and Wales; Welsh rulers sought his support and supplied some troops for his army in 893.<br />
 <br />
Alfred succeeded in government as well as at war. He was a wise administrator, organizing his finances and the service due from his thanes (noble followers). He scrutinized the administration of justice and took steps to ensure the protection of the weak from oppression by ignorant or corrupt judges. He promulgated an important code of laws, after studying the principles of lawgiving in the Book of Exodus and the codes of Aethelbert of Kent, Ine of Wessex (688-694), and Offa of Mercia (757-796), again with special attention to the protection of the weak and dependent. While avoiding unnecessary changes in custom, he limited the practice of the blood feud and imposed heavy penalties for breach of oath or pledge.<br />
 <br />
Alfred is most exceptional, however, not for his generalship or his administration but for his attitude toward learning. He shared the contemporary view that Viking raids were a divine punishment for the people's sins, and he attributed these to the decline of learning, for only through learning could men acquire wisdom and live in accordance with God's will. Hence, in the lull from attack between 878 and 885, he invited scholars to his court from Mercia, Wales, and the European continent. He learned Latin himself and began to translate Latin books into English in 887. He directed that all young freemen of adequate means must learn to read English, and, by his own translations and those of his helpers, he made available English versions of "those books most necessary for all men to know," books that would lead them to wisdom and virtue. The Ecclesiastical History of the English People, by the English historian Bede, and the Seven Books of Histories Against the Pagans, by Paulus Orosius, a 5th-century theologian--neither of which was translated by Alfred himself, though they have been credited to him--revealed the divine purpose in history. Alfred's translation of the Pastoral Care of St. Gregory I, the great 6th-century pope, provided a manual for priests in the instruction of their flocks, and a translation by Bishop Werferth of Gregory's Dialogues supplied edifying reading on holy men. Alfred's rendering of the Soliloquies of the 5th-century theologian St. Augustine of Hippo, to which he added material from other works of the Fathers of the Church, discussed problems concerning faith and reason and the nature of eternal life. This translation deserves to be studied in its own right, as does his rendering of Boethius' Consolation of Philosophy. In considering what is true happiness and the relation of providence to faith and of predestination to free will, Alfred does not fully accept Boethius' position but depends more on the early Fathers. In both works, additions include parallels from contemporary conditions, sometimes revealing his views on the social order and the duties of kingship. Alfred wrote for the benefit of his people, but he was also deeply interested in theological problems for their own sake and commissioned the first of the translations, Gregory's Dialogues, "that in the midst of earthly troubles he might sometimes think of heavenly things." He may also have done a translation of the first 50 psalms. Though not Alfred's work, the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, one of the greatest sources of information about Saxon England, which began to be circulated about 890, may have its origin in the intellectual interests awakened by the revival of learning under him. His reign also saw activity in building and in art, and foreign craftsmen were attracted to his court.<br />
 <br />
In one of his endeavours, however, Alfred had little success; he tried to revive monasticism, founding a monastery and a nunnery, but there was little enthusiasm in England for the monastic life until after the revivals on the European continent in the next century.<br />
 <br />
Alfred, alone of Anglo-Saxon kings, inspired a full-length biography, written in 893, by the Welsh scholar Asser. This work contains much valuable information, and it reveals that Alfred labored throughout under the burden of recurrent, painful illness; and beneath Asser's rhetoric can be seen a man of attractive character, full of compassion, able to inspire affection, and intensely conscious of the responsibilities of kingly office. This picture is confirmed by Alfred's laws and writings.<br />
 <br />
Alfred was never forgotten: his memory lived on through the middle ages and in legend as that of a king who won victory in apparently hopeless circumstances and as a wise lawgiver. Some of his works were copied as late as the 12th century. Modern studies have increased knowledge of him but have not altered in its essentials the medieval conception of a great king. (D.W.)<br />

 <br />
From Wikipedia<br />
 <br />
Alfred (849? - 26 October 899) (sometimes spelt Ælfred) was king of the southern Anglo-Saxon kingdom of Wessex from 871 to 899. Alfred is famous for his defence of the kingdom against the Danes (Vikings), becoming as a result the only English monarch to be awarded the epithet "the Great" by his people. Details of his life are known as a result of a work by the Welsh scholar, Asser. A learnèd man, Alfred encouraged education and improved the kingdom's law system.<br />
 <br />
Childhood<br />
Alfred was born sometime between 847 and 849 AD at Wantage in Berkshire (alterations to county borders in 1974 mean that Wantage is now part of Oxfordshire), the fourth son of King Ethelwulf of Wessex (or Æthelwulf), most likely by his first wife, Osburh. He succeeded his brother, Ethelred I, as King of Wessex and Mercia in 871.<br />
 <br />
He seems to have been a child of singular attractiveness and promise, and tales of his boyhood were remembered. At five years old, in 853, he is said to have been sent to Rome, where he was confirmed by Pope Leo IV, who is also said to have "anointed him as king." Later writers took this as an anticipatory crowning in preparation for his ultimate succession to the throne of Wessex. That, however, could not have been foreseen in 853, as Alfred had three elder brothers living. It is likely to be understood either of investiture with the consular insignia or possibly with some titular royalty such as that of the under-kingdom of Kent.<br />
 <br />
This tale is likely apocryphal, though in 854?855 Alfred almost certainly did go with his father on a pilgrimage to Rome, spending some time at the court of Charles the Bald, King of the Franks. In 858, Ethelwulf died.<br />
 <br />
Public life<br />
During the short reigns of his two eldest brothers, Ethelbald and Ethelbert, nothing is heard of Alfred. But with the accession of the third brother, Ethelred, in 866 the public life of Alfred began, and he began his great work of delivering England from the Danes. It is in this reign that Asser applies to Alfred the unique title of secundarius, which seems to show a position akin to that of the Celtic tanist, a recognized successor, closely associated with the reigning prince. It is likely that this arrangement was sanctioned by the Witenagemot, to guard against the danger of a disputed succession should Aethelred fall in battle. The arrangement of crowning a successor as co-king, however, is well-known among Germanic tribes, such as the Swedes, and the Franks, with whom the Anglo-Saxons had close ties (see diarchy and Germanic king).<br />
Alfred the Great's birthplace Wantage boasts a statue of its greatest son.<br />
 <br />
In 868 Alfred married Ealhswith, daughter of Aethelred Mucill, who is called ealdorman of the Gaini, a folk who dwelt in Lincolnshire about Gainsborough. She was the granddaughter of a former King of Mercia, and they had five or six children, one a daughter, Ethelfleda, who would become queen of Mercia in her own right.<br />
 <br />
The same year Alfred, fighting beside his brother Ethelred, made an unsuccessful attempt to relieve Mercia from the pressure of the Danes. For nearly two years Wessex had a respite. But at the end of 870 the storm burst; and the year which followed has been rightly called "Alfred's year of battles."<br />
 <br />
Nine general engagements were fought with varying fortune, though the place and date of two of them have not been recorded. A successful skirmish at Battle of Englesfield, Berkshire (31 December 870), was followed by a severe defeat at the Battle of Reading (4 January 871), and this, four days later, by the brilliant victory of Battle of Ashdown, near Compton Beauchamp in Shrivenham Hundred.<br />
 <br />
On 22 January 871 the English were again defeated at Basing, and on 22 March 871 at Marton, Wiltshire, the two unidentified battles having perhaps occurred in the interval.<br />
 <br />
Accession<br />
In April Ethelred died, and Alfred succeeded to the whole burden of the contest. While he was busied with the burial and associated ceremonies for his brother, the Danes defeated the English in his absence at an unnamed spot, and once more in his presence at Wilton in May. After this peace was made, and for the next five years the Danes were occupied in other parts of England, Alfred merely keeping a force of observation on the border. But in 876, the Danes, under a new leader, Guthrum, slipped past him and attacked Wareham. From there, early in 877 and under the pretext of talks, they made a dash westwards and took Exeter. Here Alfred blockaded them, and a relieving fleet having been scattered by a storm, the Danes had to submit and withdraw to Mercia. But in January 878 they made a sudden swoop on Chippenham, a royal stronghold in which Alfred had been keeping his Christmas, "and most of the people they reduced, except the King Alfred, and he with a little band made his way  by wood and swamp, and after Easter he  made a fort at Athelney, and from that fort kept fighting against the foe" (Chronicle).<br />
 <br />
A legend tells how, while a fugitive in the marshes of Athelney near North Petherton in Somerset, after the first Danish invasion, he was given shelter by a peasant woman who, ignorant of his identity, left him to watch some cakes she had left cooking on the fire. Preoccupied with the problems of the kingdom, Alfred let the cakes burn, and was taken to task by the woman on her return. Upon realizing the king's identity, the woman apologized profusely, but Alfred insisted that he was the one who needed to apologize. The thought that Alfred, during his retreat at Athelney, was a helpless fugitive rests upon the legend of the cakes. In truth he was organizing victory. At about the same time, he is supposed to have disguised himself as a harpist to gain entry to Guthrum's camp and discover his plans.<br />
 <br />
By the middle of May, his preparations were complete and he moved out of Athelney, being joined on the way by the levies of Somerset, Wiltshire and Hampshire. The Danes on their side moved out of Chippenham, and the two armies met at the Battle of Edington in Wiltshire. The result was a decisive victory for Alfred. The Danes submitted. Guthrum, the Danish king, and twenty-nine of his chief men took baptism. As a result, England became split into two, the south-western half kept by the Saxons and the north-eastern half becoming known as the Danelaw. By the next year (879) not only Wessex, but Mercia, west of Watling Street, was cleared of the invader. This is the arrangement known to historians as the peace of Wedmore (878), though no document embodying its provisions is in existence.<br />
 <br />
Though for the time being the north-eastern half of England, including London, was in the hands of the Danes, in truth the tide had turned. For the next few years there was peace, the Danes being kept busy in Europe. A landing in Kent in 884 or 885, though successfully repelled, encouraged the East Anglian Danes to rise up. The measures taken by Alfred to repress this uprising culminated in the taking of London in 885 or 886, and the treaty known as Alfred and Guthrum's peace, whereby the boundaries of the treaty of Wedmore (with which this is often mistaken) were materially modified to Alfred's gain.<br />
 <br />
Once more for a time there was a lull; but in the fall of 892 or 893 the last storm burst. The Danes, finding their position in Europe becoming more and more precarious, crossed to England in two divisions, amounting in the aggregate to 330 sail, and entrenched themselves, the larger body at Appledore, Kent, and the lesser under Haesten at Milton also in Kent. The fact that the new invaders brought their wives and children with them shows that this was no mere raid, but a meaningful attempt, in concert with the Northumbrian and East Anglian Danes, to conquer England. Alfred, in 893 or 894, took up a position whence he could observe both forces. While he was in talks with Haesten the Danes at Appledore broke out and struck north-westwards, but were overtaken by Alfred's eldest son, Edward, and defeated in a general engagement at Farnham, and driven to take refuge in Thorney Island in the Hertfordshire Colne, where they were blockaded and ultimately compelled to submit. They then fell back on Essex, and after suffering another defeat at Benfleet coalesced with Haesten's force at Shoebury.<br />
 <br />
Alfred had been on his way to relieve his son at Thorney when he heard that the Northumbrian and East Anglian Danes were besieging Exeter and an unnamed stronghold on the North Devon shore. Alfred at once hurried westward and raised the siege of Exeter; the fate of the other place is not recorded. Meanwhile the force under Haesten set out to march up the Thames Valley, possibly with the idea of assisting their friends in the west. But they were met by a large force under the three great ealdormen of Mercia, Wiltshire and Somerset, and made to head off to the north-west, being finally overtaken and blockaded at Buttington, which some identify with Buttington Tump at the mouth of the Wye River, others with Buttington near Welshpool. An attempt to break through the English lines was defeated with loss; those who escaped retreated to Shoebury. Then after collecting reinforcements they made a sudden dash across England and occupied the ruined Roman walls of Chester. The English did not attempt a winter blockade, but contented themselves with destroying all the supplies in the neighbourhood. And early in 894 (or 895) want of food obliged the Danes to retire once more to Essex. At the end of this year and early in 895 (or 896) the Danes drew their ships up the Thames and Lea and fortified themselves twenty miles above London. A direct attack on the Danish lines failed, but later in the year Alfred saw a means of obstructing the river so as to prevent the egress of the Danish ships. The Danes realized that they were out-maneuvred. They struck off north-westwards and wintered at Bridgenorth. The next year, 896 (or 897), they gave up the struggle. Some retired to Northumbria, some to East Anglia; those who had no connections in England withdrew to the continent. The long campaign was over.<br />
 <br />
The result testifies to the confidence inspired by Alfred's character and generalship, and to the efficacy of the military reforms initiated by him. These were:<br />
   1. the division of the fyrd or national militia into two, relieving each other at set intervals, so as to ensure continuity in military operations;<br />
   2. the building of strongholds (burgs) and garrisons at certain points;<br />
   3. the enforcement of the obligations of thanehood on all owners of five hides of land, thus giving the king a nucleus of highly equipped troops.<br />
 <br />
Reorganization<br />
After the dispersal of the Danish invaders Alfred turned his attention to the increase of the royal navy, and ships were built according to the king's own designs, partly to repress the ravages of the Northumbrian and East Anglian Danes on the coasts of Wessex, partly to prevent the landing of fresh hordes. This is not, as often asserted, the beginning of the English navy. There had been earlier naval operations under Alfred. One naval engagement was certainly fought under Æthelwulf (in 851), and earlier ones, possibly in 833 and 840. The partisan Anglo-Saxon Chronicle credits Alfred with the construction of a new type of boat, 'swifter, steadier and also higher/more responsive (hierran) than the others'; but these new ships were not a great success, as we hear of them grounding in action and foundering in a storm. Nevertheless both the Royal Navy and the United States Navy claim Alfred as the founder of their traditions.<br />
 <br />
Alfred's main fighting force was separated into two, 'so that there was always half at home and half out' (Anglo-Saxon Chronicle). The level of organization required to mobilise his large army in two shifts of which one was feeding the other must have been considerable. The complexity which Alfred's administration had attained by 892 is demonstrated by a reasonably reliable charter whose witness list includes a thesaurius, cellararius and pincerna-treasurer, food-keeper and butler. Despite the irritation which Alfred must have felt in 893, when one division, which had 'completed their call-up (stemn)' gave up the siege of a Danish army even as Alfred was moving to relieve them, this system seems to have worked remarkably well on the whole.<br />
 <br />
One of the weaknesses of pre-Alfredian defences had been that, in the absence of a standing army, fortresses were largely left unoccupied, making it very possible for a Viking force quickly to secure a strong strategic position. Alfred substantially upgraded the state of many of Wessex's fortresses, as has been demonstrated by systematic excavation of four West Saxon boroughs (at Wareham, Cricklade, Lydford and Wallingford) that "in every case the rampart associated by the excavators with the borough of the Alfredian period was the primary defence on the site" (N.P. Brooks The Development of Military Obligations in Eighth and Ninth Century England). We know that such defences were not constructed by the occasional Danish occupiers, thanks to surviving transcripts of the formidable 11th Century administrative manuscript known as the Burghal Hidage, dated within 20 years of Alfred's death-it may well date to Alfred's reign, and it almost certainly reflects Alfredian policy. This documents the established position of these four burhs, among many others, as permanently garrisoned and maintained fortress-towns. By comparing town plans of Wallingford and Wareham with that of Winchester, one can see 'that they were laid out in the same scheme' (P. Wormald in J. Campbell, ed., The Anglo-Saxons). This supports the proposition that these newly established burhs were planned as centers of habitation and trade as well as a place of safety in moments of immediate danger.<br />
 <br />
The 'Burghal Hidage' sets out the obligations for the upkeep and defense of these towns; in this way, the English population and its wealth was drawn into towns where it was not only safer from Viking soldiers, but also taxable by the King.<br />
 <br />
Alfred is thus credited with a significant degree of civil re-organization, especially in the districts ravaged by the Danes. Even if one rejects the thesis crediting the 'Burghal Hidage' to Alfred, what is undeniable is that, in the parts of Mercia acquired by Alfred from the Vikings, the shire system seems now to have been introduced for the first time. This is at least one grain of truth in the legend that Alfred was the inventor of shires, hundreds and tithings. The finances also needed attention; but the subject is obscure, and we cannot accept Asser's description of Alfred's appropriation of his revenue as more than an ideal sketch. Alfred's care for the administration of justice is testified both by history and legend; and the title "protector of the poor" was his by unquestioned right. Of the action of the Witangemot we do not hear very much under Alfred. That he was anxious to respect its rights is conclusively proved, but both the circumstances of the time and the character of the king would tend to throw more power into his hands. The legislation of Alfred probably belongs to the later part of the reign, after the pressure of the Danes had relaxed.<br />
 <br />
Foreign relations<br />
Asser speaks grandiosely of Alfred's relations with foreign powers, but little definite information is available. He certainly corresponded with Elias III, the patriarch of Jerusalem, and probably sent a mission to India. Embassies to Rome conveying the English alms to the Pope were fairly frequent; while Alfred's interest in foreign countries is shown by the insertions which he made in his translation of Orosius.<br />
 <br />
Around 890 Wulfstan of Haithabu undertook a journey from Haithabu on Jutland along the Baltic Sea to the Prussian trading town Truso. Wulfstan reported details of his trip to Alfred the Great.<br />
 <br />
His relations to the Celtic princes in the southern half of the island are clearer. Comparatively early in his reign the Welsh princes, owing to the pressure on them of North Wales and Mercia, commended themselves to Alfred. Later in the reign the North Welsh followed their example, and the latter co-operated with the English in the campaign of 893 (or 894). That Alfred sent alms to Irish as well as to European monasteries may be taken on Asser's authority; the visit of the three pilgrim "Scots" (i.e., Irish) to Alfred in 891 is undoubtedly authentic; the story that he himself in his childhood was sent to Ireland to be healed by St. Modwenna, though mythical, may show Alfred's interest in that island.<br />
 <br />
Christianity and literature<br />
The history of the church under Alfred is most obscure. The Danish inroads had told heavily upon it; the monasteries had been special points of attack, and though Alfred founded two or three monasteries and imported foreign monks, there was no general revival of monasticism under him.<br />
 <br />
To the ruin of learning and education wrought by the Danes, and the practical extinction of the knowledge of Latin even among the clergy, the preface to Alfred's translation into Old English of Pope Gregory's Pastoral Care bears eloquent witness. It was to remedy these evils that he established a court school, after the example of Charlemagne; for this he imported scholars like Grimbald and John the Saxon from Europe and Asser from South Wales; for this, above all, he put himself to school, and made the series of translations for the instruction of his clergy and people, most of which yet survive. These belong unquestionably to the latter of his reign, likely to the last four years, during which the chronicles are almost silent.<br />
 <br />
Apart from the lost Handboc or Encheiridion, which seems to have been merely a commonplace-book kept by the king, the earliest work to be translated was the Dialogues of Gregory, a book greatly popular in the Middle Ages. In this case the translation was made by Alfred's great friend Werferth, Bishop of Worcester, the king merely furnishing a foreword. The next work to be undertaken was Gregory's Pastoral Care, especially for the good of the parish clergy. In this Alfred keeps very close to his original; but the introduction which he prefixed to it is one of the most interesting documents of the reign, or indeed of English history. The next two works taken in hand were historical, the Universal History of Orosius and Bede's Ecclesiastical History of the English People. The priority should likely be given to the Orosius, but the point has been much debated. In the Orosius, by omissions and additions, Alfred so remodels his original as to produce an almost new work; in the Bede the author's text is closely stuck to, no additions being made, though most of the documents and some other less interesting matters are omitted. Of late years doubts have been raised as to Alfred's authorship of the Bede translation. But the sceptics cannot be regarded as having proved their point.<br />
 <br />
We come now to what is in many ways the most interesting of Alfred's works, his translation of The Consolation of Philosophy of Boethius, the most popular philosophical handbook of the middle ages. Here again Alfred deals very freely with his original and though the late Dr. G. Schepss showed that many of the additions to the text are to be traced not to Alfred himself, but to the glosses and commentaries which he used, still there is much in the work which is solely Alfred's and highly characteristic of his genius. It is in the Boethius that the oft-quoted sentence occurs: "My will was to live worthily as long as I lived, and after my life to leave to them that should come after, my memory in good works." The book has come down to us in two manuscripts only. In one of these the poems with which the original is interspersed are rendered into prose, in the other into alliterating verse. The authorship of the latter has been much disputed; but likely they also are by Alfred. Of the authenticity of the work as a whole there has never been any doubt.<br />
 <br />
The last of Alfred's works is one to which he gave the name Blostman, i.e., "Blooms" or Anthology. The first half is based mainly on the Soliloquies of St Augustine of Hippo, the remainder is drawn from various sources, and contains much that is Alfred's own and highly characteristic of him. The last words of it may be quoted; they form a fitting epitaph for the noblest of English kings. "Therefore he seems to me a very foolish man, and truly wretched, who will not increase his understanding while he is in the world, and ever wish and long to reach that endless life where all shall be made clear."<br />
 <br />
Beside these works of Alfred's, the Saxon Chronicle almost certainly, and a Saxon Martyrology, of which fragments only exist, probably owe their inspiration to him. A prose version of the first fifty Psalms has been attributed to him; and the attribution, though not proved, is perfectly possible. Additionally, Alfred appears as a character in The Owl and the Nightingale, where his wisdom and skill with proverbs is attested. Additionally, The Proverbs of Alfred, which exists for us in a 13th century manuscript, contain sayings that very likely have their origins partly with the king. In honor of Alfred, the University of Liverpool now has a King Alfred Chair of English Literature.<br />
 <br />
Famous historical fiction author Bernard Cornwell has recently started a retelling saga about Alfred's life.<br />

Thomas I or Tommaso I (1178 - March 1, 1233) was Count of Savoy from 1189 - 1233. He was the son of Humbert III of Savoy and Beatrice of Viennois. His birth was seen as miraculous; his monkish father had despaired of having a male heir after three wives. Count Humbert sought counsel from St. Anthelm, who blessed Humbert three times, and it was seen as a prophecy come true when Thomas was born shortly after Anthelm himself died on June 26, 1178. He was named in honor of St. Thomas Becket.<br />
 <br />
Thomas possessed the martial abilities, energy, and brilliance that his father lacked, and Savoy enjoyed a golden age under his leadership. He had taken over effective rule of Savoy by August 1191, and despite his youth he began the push north-west into new territories. He conquerored Vaud, Bugey, and Carignano. He supported the Hohenstaufens, and was known as "Thomas the Ghibelline" due to his career as Imperial Vicar of Lombardy.<br />
 <br />
In 1195 he ambushed the party of Count William I of Geneva, which was escorting the count's daughter, Marguerite, to France for her intended wedding to King Philip II of France. Thomas carried off Marguerite and married her himself, producing some eight sons and six daughters.<br />

Christopher Avery, the emigrant ancestor and progenitor of the Averyfamily, was born in England about 1590. He was a weaver by trade, andcame to this country and located at Gloucester, Massachusetts, where hewas selectman in 1646, 1652 and 1654. At a court in Salem he took thefreeman's oath, June 29, 1692, and was chosen clerk of the band,constable, and clerk of the market. His wife did not come to thiscountry. In 1658 he sold lands at Gloucester and removed to Boston, whereon the 16th of March, 1658-9 he purchased land, a small lot, abouttwenty-six by forty-six feet. It was located in what is now the centre ofthe post-office building, facing on Devonshire street. The famous oldspring, which gave the name to Spring Lane and which is now preservedunder the post-office, was near. This Avery plot was a part of, or atleast adjoined, the site of two notable resorts of later days--the wellknown restaurant whence first came the famous "Julien soup", and the"Stackpole House," not much less famous. The Winthrop estate was not faraway, and near by , in after years, Benjamin Franklin was born.Christoper Avery did not long retain this property, for March 22, 1663,he sold land to Ambrose Dew, for forty pounds. There had evidently beenno increase of value in the five years that he had held possession. Afterbeing owned by two or three different persons, it was bought by Mr.Stackpole about 1790. Christopher Avery now followed his son James toConnecticut, and August 8 1665, purchased a house, orchard and lot ofRobert Burrows in New London. Here he claimed exemption from watching andtraining, on account of age, in June 1667, and was made freeman of thecolony October, 1669. He died March 12, 1670, by Minor diary.<br />

Alfonso II of Aragon (Alfons I of Provence and Barcelona, 1152-1196), known as the Chaste or the Troubadour was king of Aragon and count of Barcelona from 1162 to 1196. He was the son of Ramon Berenguer IV of Barcelona and Petronila of Aragon.<br />
 <br />
Born Ramon Berenguer, he ascended the united thrones of Aragon (1164) and Barcelona (1162) as Alfonso, changing his name in compliment to the Aragonese, to honor King Alfonso I of Aragon. He was the first ruler to be both king of Aragon and count of Barcelona. He was also Count of Provence from 1181 to 1185.<br />
 <br />
For most of his reign he was allied with King Alfonso VIII of Castile, both against Navarre and against the Moorish taifa kingdoms of the south. In his Reconquista effort Alfonso pushed as far as Teruel, conquering this important stronghold on the road to Valencia in 1171. The same year saw him capturing Caspe.<br />

Apart from common interests, kings of Aragon and Castile were united by a formal bond of vassalage the former owed to the latter. Besides, on January 18, 1174 in Saragossa Alfonso married infanta Sancha of Castile, sister of the Castilean king.<br />
 <br />
Another milestone in this alliance was a formal treaty the two kings concluded at Cazorla in 1179, delineating zones of conquest in the south along the watershed of rivers Júcar and Segura. Southern areas of Valencia including Denia were thus secured to Aragon.<br />
 <br />
During his reign Catalonian influence north of the Pyrenees reached its zenith. His realms incorporated not only Provence, but also the counties of Cerdagne and Roussillon (inherited in 1172). Béarn and Bigorre paid hommage to him in 1187. Alfonso's involvement in the affairs of Languedoc, which will cost the life of his successor, Peter II of Aragon, for the moment proved highly beneficial, strengthening Catalonian trade and stimulating emigration from the north to colonise the newly reconquered lands in Aragon.<br />
 <br />
King Alfonso died in 1196. He was a noted poet of his time and a close friend of King Richard the Lionheart.<br />

A patroness of troubadours such as Giraud de Calanson and Peire Raymond, the queen became involved in a legal dispute with her husband concerning properties which formed part of her dower estates. In 1177 she entered the county of Ribagorza and took forcible possession of various castles and fortresses which had belonged to the crown there.<br />
After her husband died at Perpignan in 1196, Sancha was relegated to the background of political affairs by her son Pedro II, and she retired from court, withdrawing to the abbey of Nuestra Senora, at Sijena, which she had founded. There she assumed the cross of the Order of St John of Jerusalem which she wore till the end of her life. The queen mother entertained her widowed daughter Queen Constanza of Hungary (1179-1222) at Sijena prior to her leaving Aragon for her marriage with the emperor Frederick II in 1208. She died soon afterwards, aged fifty-four, and was interred before the high altar of the church at Sijena.<br />

Renard (no 32) is not attested as member of the family. He is named as a count in a trial about Tonnerrois and fit at the good place for the missing generation in the family (to justify Renard IIʼs name, wich was no more inherited from a pseudo ʻBar-sur-Seineʼ dynasty, and because Milo IIʼs daughter was a Ren-trude).<br />

Eleanor of Lancaster (sometimes called Eleanor Plantagenet1) (about 1315 - 11 January 1372) was born in Arundel, West Sussex, England, the fifth daughter of Henry, Earl of Lancaster (c. 1281-1345) and his wife Maud Chaworth (1282-1322).<br />
 <br />
First marriage and offspring<br />
Sometime between September 1 and November 6, 1330, she married John Beaumont, 2nd Lord Beaumont, son of Henry Beaumont, 4th Earl of Buchan (c. 1288 - 1340) and his wife Alice Comyn (c. 1291-1349). They had two children:<br />
   1. Henry Beaumont, 3rd Lord Beaumont, born late 1339<br />
   2. Matilda Beaumont (died July 1467), married Hugh de Courtenay<br />
 <br />
Eleanor was a lady-in-waiting to Queen Philippa, and was in service to her in Ghent when her son Henry was born. John de Beaumont died in a tournament on 14 April 1342.<br />
 <br />
Second marriage<br />
On 5 February 1344 at Ditton Church, Stoke Poges, Buckinghamshire, she married Richard Fitzalan, 10th Earl of Arundel, 4th Earl of Surrey, known by the soubriquet of "Copped Hat", Justiciar of North Wales, Governor of Carnarvon Castle, Admiral of the West.2<br />
 <br />
His previous marriage, to Isabel le Despenser, had taken place when they were children. It was annulled by Papal mandate as she, since her father's attainder and execution, had ceased to be of any importance to him. The Pope obligingly annulled the marriage, bastardized the issue, and provided a dispensation for his second marriage to the woman with whom he had been living in adultery (the dispensation, dated 4 March 1344/5, was required because his first and second wives were first cousins).<br />
 <br />
The children of Eleanor's second marriage were:<br />
   1. Richard (1346-1397), who succeeded as Earl of Arundel<br />
   2. John Fitzalan(bef 1349-1379)<br />
   3. Thomas Arundel, Archbishop of York (c. 1350-February 19, 1413)<br />
   4. Joan Fitzalan (bef. 1351-April 17, 1419), married Humphrey de Bohun, 7th Earl of Hereford<br />
   5. Alice Fitzalan (1352-March 17, 1416), married Thomas Holland, 2nd Earl of Kent<br />
 <br />
Eleanor died at Arundel and was buried at Lewes Priory in Lewes, Sussex, England. Her husband was buried beside her; in his will Richard requests to be buried "near to the tomb of Eleanor de Lancaster, my wife; and I desire that my tomb be no higher than hers, that no men at arms, horses, hearse, or other pomp, be used at my funeral, but only five torches...as was about the corpse of my wife, be allowed."<br />

Richard of Autun (ca.867-September 1, 921) was Count of Autun and the first Duke of Burgundy.<br />
 <br />
Richard was reportedly son to either Theodore, Count of Ardennes or Boso, Count of Metz by his wife Richilde the Frank. Either of the two men may have been his paternal uncle. Richard was brother or possibly first cousin to Richilde, second wife of Charles the Bald.<br />
 <br />
The duchy was entrusted upon him by king Charles the Bald, his brother-in-law, in 887. The lands of Burgundy initially comprised the counties of Autun, Macon, Chalon-sur-Sane, Langres, Nevers, Auxerre and Sens, but in the following centuries, the duchy would expand far beyond these counties.<br />
 <br />
Richard married Adelaide of Auxerre in 888. She was daughter to Conrad II, Count of Auxerre and Ermentrude of Alsace. They had several sons and daughters including:<br />
    * Rudolph, Duke of Burgundy.<br />

Richard FitzAlan, 10th Earl of Arundel (c. 1313-January 24, 1376) was an English nobleman and military leader.<br />
 <br />
Fitzalan was the eldest son of Edmund FitzAlan, 9th Earl of Arundel, and Alice Warenne. His birthdate is uncertain, but could not have been before 1307. Around 1321, FitzAlan's father allied with King Edward II's favorites, the Hugh le Despenser, 1st Earl of Winchester and his namesake son, and Richard was married to the daughter of Hugh the Younger. Fortune turned against the Despenser party, and in 1326, FitzAlan's father was executed, and he did not succeed to his father's estates or titles.<br />
 <br />
However, political conditions had changed by 1330, and over the next few years Richard was gradually able to reacquire the Earl of Arundel as well as the great estates his father had held in Sussex and in the Welsh Marches. Beyond this, in 1334 he was made justice of North Wales (later his term in this office was made for life), sheriff for life of Caernarvonshire, and governor of Caernarfon Castle.<br />
 <br />
Despite his high offices in Wales, in the following decades Arundel spent much of his time fighting in Scotland (during the Second Wars of Scottish Independence) and France (during the Hundred Years' War). In 1337, Arundel was made joint commander of the English army in the north, and the next year he was made the sole commander.<br />
 <br />
In 1340 he fought at the Battle of Sluys, and then at the siege of Tournai. After a short term as warden of the Scottish Marches, he returned to the continent, where he fought in a number of campaigns, and was appointed Joint Lieutanant of Aquitaine in 1340.<br />
 <br />
Arundel was one of the three principal English commanders at the Battle of Crécy. He spent much of the following years on various military campaigns and diplomatic missions.<br />
 <br />
In 1353 he succeeded to the Earldom of Surrey (or Warenne), which even further increased his great wealth. (He did not however use the additional title until after the death of the Dowager Countess of Surrey in 1361.) He made very large loans to King Edward III but even so on his death left behind a great sum in hard cash.<br />
 <br />
Arundel married twice. His first wife (as mentioned above), was Isabella Despenser. He repudiated her, and had the marriage annulled on the grounds that he had never freely consented to it. After the annulment he married Eleanor of Lancaster, daughter of Henry, 3rd Earl of Lancaster and Maud Chaworth.<br />
 <br />
By his first marriage he had one daughter. By the second he had 3 sons: Richard, who succeeded him as Earl; John Fitzalan, who was a Marshall of England, and drowned in 1379; and Thomas Arundel, who became Archbishop of Canterbury. He also had 2 surviving daughters by his second wife: Joan, who married Humphrey de Bohun, 7th Earl of Hereford, and Alice, who married Thomas Holland, 2nd Earl of Kent.<br />

Mrs. J. H. Webster of Cambridge: passed away after a lingering illness onWednesday morning, 5th inst. in the 58th year of her age. She leaves ahusband and two children to mourn the loss of a faithful loving wife anda kind and christian mother. During her illness, which was of a verydistressing nature, she exhibited remarkable patience and fortitude, andan implicit trust in the Savior, whom she loved, and without a regret,except for the loved ones left behind, she passed away without a struggleto the rest beyond. The funeral took place on Friday and although the daywas very unpleasant there was a large attendance. The sermon was preachedby Rev E.O. Read, Rev Mr. Freeman, and Rev Mr. Hawley (Presbyterian) werein attendance and took part in the service. Mrs. Webster was the daughterof the late William Craig, of Brooklyn St., Cornwallis, who some twentyyears ago preceded his daughter to the better land. Mrs. Webster was bornat Morristown, Aylesford, in a house which her father, then a young man,built with his own hands about seventy years ago, in what was then analmost unbroken forest. This house, which is one of the oldest in thecounty, is still occupied, and is the comfortable home of Mr. RobertNichols. In this house and on this farm in Morristown Mr. and Mrs. Craigraised a family of eight children, in which this death makes the firstbreak. The venerable mother still lives, and at the advanced age of 92years and 8 months was able to attend the funeral of her daughter. In1857 Mr. Craig, with his family, removed from Morristown to BrooklynStreet, Cornwallis, and in 1860 Miss Catherine Craig was united inmarriage to Mr. John H. Webster, of Cambridge, with whom she resideduntil her death. By honest toil and econmy, and good luck that generallygoes with these characteristics, Mr. and Mrs. Webster, althoughcommencing with but little, soon became forehanded, and Mr. W. has for anumber of years been reckoned among our successful men. Last summer, theson, Mr. J.G. Webster married, and his father gave him the homestead, andbuilt a new house near the station for a home for himself and wife, inwhich they hoped to spend a number of quiet years of rest in their oldage. But an all-wise Providence has disarranged their plans, and Mr.Webster is left alone.<br />

Judith (c. 844-870), also called Judith Martel, was the wife of Ethelwulf of Wessex and Ethelbald of Wessex.<br />
 <br />
Judith was born probably in October of 844, the daughter of Charles the Bald, king of the Franks, and Ermentrude. She was forced by her father to marry Æthelwulf, King of Wessex on October 1, 856 at Verberie sur Oise, France; when he was 51, and she was 13.<br />
 <br />
After Æthelwulf's death on January 13, 858, she was married to his son, Æethelbald, sometime after February 858. Æethelbald was 18 and she was then 14. After Æethelbald's death, the marriage was annulled (in 860), and she was confined at Senlis.<br />
 <br />
She eloped with Baldwin I, Count of Flanders, in January 862. He was 23, she was 19. They were probably married at the monastery of Senlis before they eloped. They hid until October, when they went to her uncle Lothair for protection. From there they fled to Pope Nicholas I for protection. They were then officially married at Auxerre.<br />
 <br />
They had a son, Baldwin II, Count of Flanders, born in 864. Oddly enough, he was also called the Bald.<br />
 <br />
Judith died in 870.<br />

The Saint Peter Woolen Mill is a family-owned and operated woolen mill.It is located in the beautiful Minnesota River Valley, where it continueson to a fourth generation.<br />
In 1912, John Charles and Margaret Brinker purchased the Saint Peter Woolen Mill buildings and machinery from Edward Borneman. John Charles and his son John Henry continued in business together until John Charles Brinker's death in 1931. Charles Henry then inherited the Mill and continued in business along with his wife, Evelyn. In 1954, their son Charles Eugene Brinker and his wife Mary Lue purchased the Saint Peter Woolen Mill.<br />
The original Woolen Mill building, too old for safety, was torn down in 1960 and the machinery was moved to its present location adjacent to where the old Mill stood.<br />
Today, Charles E. Brinker's daughter Patricia Johnson continues to manage the Mill operations for a fourth generation. His son, Joel Brinker, is Sales Manager for the Mill. Another daughter, Peggy Brinker, manages Mary Lue's Yarn Shop and the Sheep Delights gift shop. The tradition of the Saint Peter Woolen Mill continues in the Brinker family.<br />

After an illness of severe intensity and of a years duration, rest cameMonday morning at 3: A.M., May 8th, 1944.<br />
Thomas Henry Scott was born March 17, 1904 to Thomas and Harriet Scott at Rockford, Minnesota.<br />
He joined the Baptist Church at Anoka when he was about twenty years of age. May 29th, 1929 he was united in Holy Wedlock with Marguerite Cook of Osseo, Minnesota. To this union were added four children: Shirley Arlene, David Arnold, Harriet Irene, and Nancy Nell.<br />
The Scotts lived at Maple Plain until last fall when Mr. Scott's health had failed so much he could not continue his work. The cause of his illness proved to be a tumor lodged inside the skull. He was at his home during the latter part of his illness and passing.<br />
He is survived by his wife and children, by his parents; by five sisters; Lillian [Mrs Earl Snodgrass] of Buffalo, Minnesota; Mae at home; Zella [Mrs Ennis Batdorf], Wayzata; Florence [Mrs. Albert Titus], Robbinsdale; Myrtle [Mrs John Schleifer] and brother, Donald both of Minneapolis.<br />
Funeral services were held Wednesday afternoon at 2 o'clock at the Osseo Methodist Church, Rev. Upton Dahle officiating, assisted by Rev. Roy Stinlund of Armstrong.<br />

Thomas Henry Scott Jr. was born 17 Mar 1904, at the home of his parents, on Lake Sarah, near Rockford, Minnesota, in Hennepin County. He was the first son of Thomas and Mary Harriet [Prestidge] Scott. He grew up and went to school in the Rockford area, but did not complete grade school.<br />
At one time my dad [Tom] had a ferret. He kept the ferret in a barrel of straw in the basement. Sometimes the ferret would bite the fingers of one of us kids. A ferret will not release their bite until they draw blood, so the only way we could get our finger out of it's mouth was to spit on the ferrets nose so it couldn't breath, or put it's head under water.<br />
The ferret was used to flush rabbits out of their burrow. He would put the ferret into the burrow and then it would chase the rabbits out. The kids had to stand guard and let him know which hole the rabbit came out of, so he could shoot it. He had a problem with the ferret killing the rabbits, and eating them, then the ferret's hunger would be satisfied and it would not come back out of the burrow. He took care of that problem by taking the ferret to the dentist, and having it's teeth cut off, so it could not hurt the rabbits. My brother David went to the Dentist with him, and watched as Daddy held down the Ferret and the Dentist took care of his teeth. He first went to a dentist in Delano, who refused to do the job, and then to the Dentist in Rockford, who didn't mind working on the teeth of a ferret.<br />
Until Tom became ill with a malignant brain tumor, he farmed with his father Thomas Scott Sr. The family then moved to Osseo, Minnesota. Tom is remembered for an outstanding sense of humor, a remarkably good singing voice, his drive toward hard work, and best of all: his love for his children.<br />

Robert, 1st Earl of Gloucester (~1090 - October 31, 1147) was an illegitimate son of Henry I of England, and one of the dominant figures of the English Anarchy period.<br />
 <br />
Robert was probably the eldest of Henry's many illegitimate children. He was born at Caen in Normandy before his father's accession to the English throne. His mother is not known for certain, though recent scholarship suggests she was a member of the Gay family, minor nobility in Oxfordshire. William of Malmesbury refers to Robert's "Norman, Flemish, and French" ancestry, but this may be a reference only to his father's side of the family. Robert was acknowledged at birth, and raised at his father's court. He had a reputation of being an educated man, not altogether surprising considering his father's scholarly inclinations. He was a patron of William of Malmesbury and Geoffrey of Monmouth.<br />
 <br />
He married in 1107 to Mabel of Gloucester, daughter of Robert Fitzhamon, thereby receiving lordship of Gloucester and Glamorgan. She died in 1157. Their children were:<br />
   1. William Fitz Robert, 2nd Earl of Gloucester, died 1183<br />
   2. Roger Fitz Robert, Bishop of Worcester, died 1179<br />
   3. Hamon Fitz Robert, slain at the siege of Toulouse in 1159<br />
   4. Philip Fitz Robert, Castellan of Cricklade, died after 1147<br />
   5. Richard Fitz Robert, lord of Creully, died 1175<br />
   6. Maud of Gloucester, died 1189, wife of Ranulph de Gernon, 2nd Earl of Chester<br />
 <br />
In 1119, Robert fought at the Battle of Bremule; he was already one of King Henry's foremost military captains. In 1122, he was created Earl of Gloucester.<br />
 <br />
At his father's death, in the struggle between the Empress Matilda and Stephen for the English throne, he at first declared for Stephen, but subsequently left Stephen's service and was loyal to Matilda, his half-sister, until his death. According to the Gesta Stephani:<br />
 <br />
    "Among others came Robert, Earl of Gloucester, son of King Henry, but a bastard, a man of proved talent and admirable wisdom. When he was advised, as the story went, to claim the throne on his father's death, deterred by sounder advice he by no means assented, saying it was fairer to yield it to his sister's son (the future Henry II of England), than presumptuously to arrogate it to himself."<br />
 <br />
At the Battle of Lincoln, he captured Stephen, whom he imprisoned in the custody of his wife, Mabel. This advantage was lost, however, when Robert fell into the hands of Stephen's partisans at Winchester, covering Matilda's escape from a failed siege. Robert was so important to Matilda's cause that she released Stephen to regain Robert's services. In 1142 she sent Robert to convince her husband Geoffrey of Anjou to join her cause. Geoffrey refused to go to England until he conquered Normandy, so Robert stayed in France to help him until he learned of Matilda being besieged at Oxford. He hastened back to England, along with Matilda's young son Henry. In 1144 one of Robert's own sons, Philip, declared for Stephen and so Robert found himself and his son on opposite sides.<br />
 <br />
Robert fought tirelessly on Matilda's behalf until his death in 1147 from a fever at Bristol. One of his illegitimate sons was Richard, Bishop of Bayeux (died 1142).<br />

Edward I is sometimes referred to as "the English Justinian" He had alove for justice, honor, and order in his affairs. At one point in hisreign, he faced a declaration of war with France and rebellions from theWelsh and Scots. He decided that the only way to overcome hisdifficulties would be to solicit the support of his people. In 1295 hecalled together a parliament consisting of representatives of thenobility, the church, and the common people. This "Model Parliament"marked the beginning of parliamentary government in England, a systemthat has continued to the present day. "What touches all," Edwardproclaimed, "should be approved by all, and it is also clear that commondangers should be met by measures agreed upon in common." He restrictedthe power of the king by accepting the rule that taxes could not belevied or laws made except by the consent of parliament.<br />

Edward the Elder (871? - July 17, 924) was King of England (899 - 924). He was the son of Alfred the Great and became King of Wessex upon his father's death in 899.<br />
 <br />
Edward arguably exceeded Alfred's military achievements, restoring the Danelaw to Saxon rule and reigning in Mercia from 918, after the death of his sister, Ethelfleda. He spent his early reign fighting his cousin Aethelwald, son of Ethelred I. He had about eighteen children from his three marriages, and may have had an illegitimate child, too. He died in 924 and was buried at Winchester. Edmund I, or Edmund the Deed-Doer (921-May 26, 946) who was King of England from 939 was a son of Edward the Elder, and a half-brother to Athelstan.  Athelstan died on October 27, 939, and Edmund succeeded him as King.<br />
 <br />
His daughter, Eadgifu married King Charles III of France. Her son became King Louis IV of France.<br />

"My father was Carl W. Rulien and his store was Rulien Office Equipment. He started his business in Hudson in 1940. As a young girl, my friends and I also had several rummage sales in the store in the late 40s. At that time my Dadʼs business was in one large open room," she said.<br />
"He had a wonderful slogan he used on his business cards. It said, ʻ"C Rulien for your next machine.ʼ He sold, rented and repaired adding machines, typewriters and cash registers along with selling office furniture and other office equipment," McConaughey said.<br />
"Dad ran his business in Hudson until 1956, the year Gwin and Petersen purchased the building. He and my mother then moved to Florida for three years. They got lonesome for their daughters and families and returned to Hudson in 1959. He reopened Rulien Office Equipment at a new location at 322 Second St." She said.<br />

King of Austrasia, King of France, Greatest of Merovingian Kings<br />
 <br />
Dagobert I, King des Francs. Born: in 603, son of Clotaire = Chlothar II, King de Soissons and Bertrude, Some sources assert that Dagobert I was born in the year 606. Note - between 623 and 629: Dagobert I became King of Austrasie in 623 and King of the Franks in 629. At the age of about 25 years, Dagobert, son of Clotaire II and of Bertrade, takes over the succession without difficulty. He must first determine the fate of his half-brother Charibert (son of Queen Sichilde), for whom his uncle Brodulf wanted to yield at least Neustria. Dagobert does not cimply and purely eliminate his half-brother, but he sends him to Aquitaine by yielding to him the cities of Saintes, Perigeux, Toulouse, Cahors, Agen and the countryside between Garonne and the Pyrenees whose residents had taken advantage of the troubles in the kingdom to ally themselves with the Basques. Dagobert wins Dijon and also Saint-Jean-de-Losne where he lives for a few days and meets out justice. The day of his departure from Losne to Chalon, as he bathes before sunrise, he has Brodulf, Uncles of his half-brother Charibert, assassinated, the murder being executed by two of Dagobert's sons and the patrician Guillebaud. In 630, he negotiates a Treaty with the Emperor of Byzantium, Heraclius, a perpetual peace through the intermediary of his envoys, Servais and Paterne. Upon his return to Paris, Dagobert repudiates his wife Gomatrude, sister of Queen Sichilde, herself married to the deceased Clotaire II, Dagobert's father. He immediately, in 631, marries Nanthilde, a simple housekeeper. The reign of Nantilde lasts only a few years. Dagobert surrounds himself with other women, Vulfegonde, then Berthilde, finally Raintrude, an Austrasian, whom he took as concubine in the eighth year of his reign. He was skillfully taught and supported by his Ministers Saint Eloi [who was Dagobert's treasurer and then became Bishop after Dagobert died] and Dadon [alias Saint Ouen, who became Bishop of Rouen in 641 and who was instrumental in the founding of several monasteries including those of Saint-Wandrille, Rebais, and of Jumieges]. He fought the Austrasians and gave them his son, Sigebert, as next king at age 3 [in fact the Bishop of Cologne and a Duke will govern in his name] . With the Austrasian armies and the support of the Saxons and the Lombards, Dagobert overwhelms the Wendes [Slavic resident of the area between the Oder, the Elbe and the superior branch of the Danube] at Wogalisbourg (in Styria, near Gratz) in 632]. He fought the Gascons, the Slavs and the Saxons. He was the last direct Merovingien King, he was able to delay the dissolution of the Frankish Empire. In December of 638, Dagobert is stricken with an intestinal disease in his domaine of Epinay-sur-Seine, and trusts his Mayor of Neustria, Aega, the fate of his wife Nanthilde as well as that of his son Clovis II. On 19 January 639, Dagobert has himself transported to Saint-Denis, where he dies in one of the buildings adjoing the Basilica. He is the first Monarch of France to have chosen Saint-Denis as the final restiing place. It is there that Saint Denis was martyred in the third century, along with his companions Saint Rustique and Saint Eleuthere. In the fifth century, the Gallo-Roman cemetery was levelled and the basilica built. Married before 626: Gomatrude; Gomatrude was the first of five wives. Married before 629: Ragnetrud d'Austrasie; Ragnetrud was the third of Dagobert I's five wives. Married before 634: Nantechild. Died: in 639.<br />
 <br />
 <br />
From Wikipedia<br />
 <br />
Dagobert I (c. 603 - January 19, 639) was the king of the Franks from 629 to 639.<br />
 <br />
The son of King Clotaire II, Dagobert became king of Austrasia and on the death of his father, the sole king of the Franks. By 632 he had Bourgogne and Aquitaine under his rule, becoming the most powerful of the Merovingian kings and the most respected ruler in the West. He married five times.<br />
 <br />
As king, Dagobert I made Paris his capital. During his reign, he built the Altes Schloss Castle in Meersburg, Germany which today is the oldest inhabited castle in that country. Devoutly religious, Dagobert was also responsible for the construction of the Saint Denis Basilica at the site of a Benedictine Monastery in Paris.<br />
 <br />
Dagobert was the last of the Merovingian kings to wield any real royal power. In 632 the nobles of Austrasia revolted under Mayor of the Palace Pepin I, and Dagobert appeased the rebellious nobles by putting his three-year-old son Sigebert III on the Austrasian throne, thereby ceding royal power in all but name. When Dagobert died in 639, another son, Clovis II, inherited the rest of his kingdom at age five.<br />
 <br />
This pattern continued for the next century until Pippin III finally deposed the last Merovingian king in 751, establishing the Carolingian dynasty. The Merovingian boy-kings remained ineffective rulers who inherited the throne as young children and lived only long enough to produce a male heir or two, while real power lay in the hands of the noble families (the Old Noblesse) who exercised feudal control over most of the land.<br />
 <br />
Dagobert was the first of the French kings to be buried in the Royal tombs at Saint Denis Basilica.<br />
 <br />
King Dagobert was immortalized by the song Le bon roi Dagobert (The good king Dagobert), a nursery rhyme featuring exchanges between the king and his chief adviser, St. Eligius (Eloi in the French text). The satirical rhymes place Dagobert in various ridiculous positions, from which Eligius' good advice manages to extract him. The text, which probably originated in the 18th century, became extremely popular as an expression of the anti-monarchist sentiment of the French Revolution. Other than placing Dagobert and Eligius in their respective roles, it has no historical accuracy.<br />

(Redirected from Bela III of Hungary)<br />
 <br />
Béla III of Hungary (Hungarian III. Béla, Slovak: Belo III), born in 1148, was King of Kingdom of Hungary circa 1172-1196. He was the son of King Geza II of Hungary and Euphrosyne (daughter of Grand Duke Mstislav of Kiev).<br />
 <br />
As a boy he was sent to Constantinople to be educated in the court of the Emperor, Manuel I Comnenus, who intended Béla to succeed him and betrothed him to his daughter, Maria. However, when a son was born to the Emperor this engagement was broken, but another marriage was arranged between Béla and Agnes de Chatillon, a princess of Antioch. She was also the half-sister of the Empress Maria.<br />
 <br />
Béla III succeeded his brother Stephen III of Hungary and was crowned under the influence of the Byzantine Emperor Manuel I Comnenus. As the new king, Béla adopted Catholicism and crowned his son Emeric as his successor. He was a powerful ruler, and his court was counted among the most brilliant in Europe.<br />
 <br />
Béla was a warrior by nature and training, and the death of the Emperor Manuel I Comnenus in 1180 left him free to expand Hungarian power in the Balkans. His attempt to recover Dalmatia led Hungary into two wars against Venice, and ultimately faltered. He also aided the Serbs against the Byzantine Empire. At the time of his death Béla was assisting the Emperor Isaac II Angelus in a war against Bulgaria. He was succeeded by both of his sons in turn, Emeric and Andrew.<br />
[edit]<br />
 <br />
Family<br />
Béla III was engaged once and married twice.<br />
    * Maria Porphyrogenita Comnena, daughter of Emperor Manuel I Comnenus, with no issue. They were engaged in 1163, separated in 1169.<br />
    * Agnes de Chatillon (1154-1184), daughter of Raynald of Chatillon and Constance of Antioch (joint princes of Antioch). They married in 1172 with issue:<br />
      1. King Emeric of Hungary (1174-1204)<br />
      2. Margaretaé of Hungary (1175-1223), married Emperor Isaac II Angelus and Boniface of Montferrat.<br />
      3. King Andrew II of Hungary (1176-1235)<br />
      4. Soloman, died young<br />
      5. István, died young<br />
      6. Konstancia of Hungary (1180-1198), married King Otakar II of Bohemia<br />
    * Marguerite of France, daughter of King Louis VII of France, married in 1186, with no issue.<br />
 <br />
Béla is interred at the Mathias Church Cemetery in Budapest, with his second wife Agnes.<br />

Upon Clotaire's birth, his mother had his father assassinated and ruledNeustrie in his name. He became King of Soissons in 584, and was soleKing of the Franks in 613. He had his aunt Brunehaut (sister of hisfather's second wife) killed. In the year 596, through his motherFredegonde, Clotaire II's territories were extended in the East. In 599,King Theodebert II of Austrasia and King Thierry II of Burgundy joinedforces to take revenge upon Clotaire II. The Army of Neustria is beattenand the entire valley of the Seine is devastated. As a result, ThierryII's territory increased by taking away from Clotaire II, the landsbetween the Seine and the Loire. Theodebert II takes the lands of theDuchy of Dentelin. In 604, the Mayor of the Palace, Bertaut arouses thesubjects against the King of Burgundy and they call on Clotaire II forhelp. On Christmas Day, 604, Clotaire rushes to their aid and crosses theSeine and pushes all to way to Orleans. On his return, he encounters anArmy of Bourgogne, and is defeated at Etampes at which battle Bertaut iskilled. Because Theodebert had not intervened, actually he had made peacein Compiegne with Clotaire II, Thierry II took offense and the twobrothers became less than thrilled with each other. Brunehaut, unhappywith Theodebert, names as next Mayor of the Palace a Gallo-Roman namedProtadius. In 607, she pushed Thierry II to take up arms against hisbrother. During the battle, Protadius is killed and the two brothers makepeace, humiliating their mother, Brunehaut. By 612, the brothers againwere at war and Thierry II purchases Clotaire's neutrality by offeringhim the Duchy of Dentelin. In 613 Clotaire II invades Austrasia upon thedeath of Thierry II, kills two of Thierry's sons [the other twodisappear] , and has Brunehaut killed after the lords of Burgundy seizeher and give her to him. At her "trial" Clotaire II had accused Brunehautof having caused the death of ten frankish Kings:<br />
1. Sigebert her first spouse, who was assassinated [though through no fault of Brunehaut] ;<br />
2. Merovee, the son of Chilperic I [who was actually assassinated on the orders of Fredegonde] ;<br />
3. Chilperic [killed in 584, and through no part from Brunehaut] ;<br />
4. Theodebert II<br />
5. of his son Clotaire [it is possible that Brunehaut had Cloraire assassinated after he deserted her] ;<br />
6. Merovee, son of Clotaire II [highly doubtful that Brunehaut had a part in this murder] ;<br />
7. Thierry II and his three sons [Thierry died of dysentery, and 8-10. his three sons were massacred on the order of Clotaire II himself]. For 3 days, Clotaire II personally tortures Brunehaut, then he parades her tied cross-wise to the back of a camel in front of his entire assembled army. Finally, he had her hair, and limbs tied to a wild horse which was allowed to run within a confined space while being beaten, therebye causing every limb to be broken and shortly thereafter she died at age 60 to 65. At this time, Clotaire II becomes the only surviving descendant of the sons of Clovis. He governs the Frankish Kingdom from the Pyrenees to the Rhine and beyond all the way to the Elbe, and the germanic peoples must pay him tribute. However, his power is limitted as in each of the three ancient kingdoms [Austrasia, Neustria and Burgundy] the Major Domus [Mayor of the Palace] becomes progressively more important. Submitting to the pressure of these mayors, Clotaire, Clotaire II on 23 January 623 makes his son Dagobert, King of occidental Austrasia [West of the Vosges and the Ardennes] as well as of Aquitaine. Again under pressure, in 626, Clotaire gives Dagobert Gomatrude [his wife's sister] as spouse. Three days after the wedding, Dagobert claims all of Austrasia was his, but Clotaire keeps control over Provence and Aquitaine. Married before 603: Bertrude . Married before 604: Haldetrude ; Haldetrude was one of three wives.<br />
 <br />
 <br />
From Wikipedia<br />
 <br />
Clotaire II (584-629), King of Neustria, and from 613-629 King of all the Franks, was not yet born when his father, King Chilperic I died in 584. His mother, Queen Fredegonde, was regent until her death in 597, at which time the thirteen year old Clotaire II began to rule for himself. As King, he continued his mother's feud with Queen Brunhilda of Austrasia with equal viciousness and bloodshed.<br />
 <br />
In 613 Clotaire II became the first king of all the Franks since his grandfather Clotaire I died in 561 by ordering the murder of the infant Sigebert II, whom the aging Brunhilda had attempted to set on the thrones of Austrasia and Burgundia, causing a rebellion among the nobility. This led to the delivery of Brunhilda into Clotaire's hands, his thirst for vengeance leading to his formidable old aunt enduring the agony of the rack for three whole days, before suffering a horrific death, chained between four horses that were goaded in separate directions, eventually tearing her apart.<br />
 <br />
In 615, Clotaire II promulgated the Edict of Paris, a sort of Frankish Magna Carta that reserved many rights to the Frankish nobles while it excluded Jews from all civil employment for the Crown. The ban effectively placed all literacy in the Merovingian monarchy squarely under ecclesiastical control and also greatly pleased the nobles, from whose ranks the bishops were ordinarily exclusively drawn.<br />
 <br />
In 623 he gave the kingdom of Austrasia to his young son Dagobert I. This was a political move as repayment for the support of Bishop Arnulf of Metz and Pepin I, Mayor of the Palace of Austrasia, the two leading Austrasian nobles, who were effectively granted semi-autonomy.<br />
 <br />
Clotaire II died in 629.<br />

Gertrude von Meran (1185-September 24, 1213) was the first wife of AndrásII, king of Hungary. She was the daughter of Bertold IV, Duke of Meran.Her sister was Agnes of Meran, a famous beauty, who married King PhilippeAuguste of France. Yet another sister was St. Hedwig of Andechs.<br />
 <br />
She and Andrew married before 1203, and she was the mother of his successor Bela IV of Hungary and Elisabeth the Saint of Hungary, wife of Louis, margrave of Thuringia. Gertrude was killed in 1213, by the Hungarian noblemen, who were jealous over the advancement of her relatives at court.<br />

Andrew II (1175-1235) (Hungarian: II. András or II. Endre, Slovak: Ondrej II) was a son of Bela III of Hungary and succeeded his nephew, the infant Ladislaus III, in 1205.<br />
 <br />
No other king of Hungary, perhaps, was so mischievous to his country. Valiant, enterprising, pious as he was, all these fine qualities were ruined by a reckless good nature which never thought of the morrow. He declares in one of his decrees that the generosity of a king should be limitless, and he acted up to this principle throughout his reign. He gave away everything, money, villages, domains, whole counties, to the utter impoverishment of the treasury, thereby rendering the crown, for the first time in Hungarian history, dependent upon the great feudatories, who, in Hungary as elsewhere, took all they could get and gave as little as possible in return. In all matters of government, Andrew was equally reckless and haphazard. He is directly responsible for the beginnings of the feudal anarchy which well-nigh led to the extinction of the monarchy at the end of the 13th century. The great feudatories did not even respect the lives of the royal family, for Andrew was recalled from a futile attempt to reconquer Galicia (which really lay beyond the Hungarian sphere of influence), through the murder of his first wife Gertrude of Meran (1185 - September 24, 1213), by rebellious nobles jealous of the influence of her relatives.<br />
 <br />
In 1215 he married Iolanthe (Yolande) of France, but in 1217 was compelled by the pope to lead the Fifth Crusade to the Holy Land, which he undertook in hopes of being elected Latin emperor of Constantinople. The crusade excited no enthusiasm in Hungary, but Andrew contrived to collect 15,000 men together, whom he led to Venice; whence, not without much haggling and the surrender of all the Hungarian claims upon Zara, about two-thirds of them were conveyed to Acre. Nevertheless the whole expedition was a forlorn hope. The Christian kingdom of Palestine was by this time reduced to a strip of coast about 440 sq. m. in extent, and after a drawn battle with the Turks on the Jordan (November 10), and fruitless assaults on the fortresses of the Lebanon and on Mount Tabor, Andrew started home (January 18, 1218) through Antioch, Iconium, Constantinople and Bulgaria. On his return he found the feudal barons in the ascendant, and they extorted from him the Golden Bull.<br />
 <br />
Andrew's last exploit was to defeat an invasion of Frederick of Austria in 1234. The same year he married his third wife, Beatrice of Este.<br />
 <br />
Family<br />
Andrew had five children by his first wife, Gertrude:<br />
   1. Maria of Hungary (1203-1221), married Tsar Ivan Asen II of Bulgaria<br />
   2. Bela IV of Hungary (1206-1270)<br />
   3. Saint Elizabeth of Hungary (1207-1231)<br />
   4. Kálmán, Duke of Croatia (1208-1241)<br />
   5. András, King of Halicz (1210-1234)<br />
 <br />
From his second marriage to Yolande de Courtney, he had one daughter:<br />
   1. Jolán (Yolande) of Hungary (1215-1251), married James I of Aragon<br />
 <br />
Andrew's third marriage to Beatrice d'Este produced one posthumous son:<br />
   1. István (1236-1271), who was himself father of King Andrew III of Hungary<br />

Constance Hopkins was baptized on 11 May 1606 in Hursley, Hampshire,England, to parents Stephen Hopkins and his first wife Mary.  It shouldbe noted that the long-standing Constance Dudley myth was disproven in1998: the Hopkins family of the Mayflower was not from Wortley,Gloucester as had been previously speculated and published.<br />
 <br />
Constance came with her father Stephen, step-mother Elizabeth, brother Giles, and step-sister Damaris on the Mayflower in 1620, at the age of 14.  Constance's future husband, Nicholas Snow, arrived on the ship Anne in 1623.  Nicholas and Constance Snow were married shortly before the 1627 Division of Cattle, and lived in Plymouth for a time.  Around 1645, the family moved to Eastham.<br />
 <br />
William Bradford, writing in 1651, stated that Constance Hopkins had 12 children "all of them living".  Only 9 can be documented with existing records.  Constance, wife of Daniel Doane, is quite probably one of the three "missing" children, but unfortunately there is no conclusive proof.<br />

Balthild or Bathilde (Anglo-Saxon meaning "bold battle") (c. 627 -January 30, 680), queen of Neustria and Burgundy, was born in Anglia, butwas sold into slavery in the French royal court. She may originally havebeen related to Ricbehrt, the last pagan king of East Anglia.<br />
 <br />
She was a member of the household of King Clovis II's chief administrator, Echinoald, who intended her to be his wife. Under these conditions of slavery, she came into contact with, and eventually married, King Clovis II. She bore him three sons who all became king after his death: Chlotar, Childeric and Theuderic.<br />
 <br />
When Clovis died in 655, she took over as regent until Chlotar came of age in 664 and thereafter was forced into a convent for the remainder of her life. During her reign, mindful of her own slavery, she managed to outlaw the practice in Francia. She was later canonised as a saint by Pope Nicholas I.<br />

 <br />
Bohemund I of Antioch (c. 1058 - March 3, 1111), prince of Taranto and afterwards prince of Antioch, was one of the leaders of the First Crusade.<br />
 <br />
Bohemund was the eldest son of Robert Guiscard, Duke of Apulia and Calabria, by his first marriage (which was later annulled) to Alberada of Buonalbergo. He was christened "Mark" but came to be known as Bohemund, after a legendary giant of that name.<br />
 <br />
He served under his father in the great attack on the Byzantine Empire (1080-1085), and commanded the Normans during Guiscard's absence (1082-1084), penetrating into Thessaly as far as Larissa, but being repulsed by Alexius I Comnenus. This early hostility to Alexius had a great influence in determining the course and policy of his reign from time of Bohemund (whom his father had destined for the throne of Constantinople) to King Roger.<br />
 <br />
When Robert Guiscard died in 1085, Bohemund inherited his father's Adriatic possessions, which were soon lost to the Greeks, while his younger half-brother Roger Borsa inherited Apulia and the Italian possessions. The war was finally resolved by the mediation of Pope Urban II and the award of Taranto and other possessions to Bohemund. Though Bohemund received a small principality (an allodial possession) for himself in the heel of southern Italy, as compensation from Sikelgaita after renouncing his rights to the Duchy, he sought a greater status for himself. The chronicler Romoald of Salerno said of Bohemund that "he was always seeking the impossible."<br />
 <br />
In 1096 Bohemund, along with his uncle Roger I of Sicily the great count of Sicily, was attacking Amalfi, which had revolted against Duke Roger, when bands of crusaders began to pass, on their way through Italy to Constantinople. The zeal of the crusader came upon Bohemund: it is possible, too, that he saw in the First Crusade a chance of realizing his father's policy of a Drang nach Osten, and hoped from the first to carve for himself an eastern principality. Geoffrey Malaterra bluntly states that Bohemund took the Cross with the intention of plundering and conquering Greek lands.<br />
 <br />
He gathered a fine Norman army (perhaps the finest division in the crusading host), at the head of which he crossed the Adriatic Sea, and penetrated to Constantinople along the route he had tried to follow in 1082-1084. He was careful to observe a "correct" attitude towards Alexius, and when he arrived at Constantinople in April 1097 he did homage to the emperor. He may have negotiated with Alexius about a principality at Antioch; if he did so, he had little encouragement. From Constantinople to Antioch Bohemund was the real leader of the First Crusade; and it says much for his leadership that the First Crusade succeeded in crossing Asia Minor, which the Crusade of 1101, the Second Crusade in 1147, and the Third Crusade in 1189 failed to accomplish.<br />
 <br />
The Emperor's daughter, Anna Comnena, leaves a good portrait of him in her The Alexiad; she met him for the first time when she was fourteen, and was quite fascinated by him. She left no similar portrait of any other Crusader prince. Of Bohemund, she wrote:<br />
 <br />
    "Now [Bohemund] was such as, to put it briefly, had never before been seen in the land of the Romans, be he either of the barbarians or of the Greeks (for he was a marvel for the eyes to behold, and his reputation was terrifying). Let me describe the barbarian's appearance more particularly -- he was so tall in stature that he overtopped the tallest by nearly one cubit, narrow in the waist and loins, with broad shoulders and a deep chest and powerful arms. And in the whole build of the body he was neither too slender nor overweighted with flesh, but perfectly proportioned and, one might say, built in conformity with the canon of Polycleitus... His skin all over his body was very white, and in his face the white was tempered with red. His hair was yellowish, but did not hang down to his waist like that of the other barbarians; for the man was not inordinately vain of his hair, but had it cut short to the ears. Whether his beard was reddish, or any other colour I cannot say, for the razor had passed over it very closely and left a surface smoother than chalk... His blue eyes indicated both a high spirit and dignity; and his nose and nostrils breathed in the air freely; his chest corresponded to his nostrils and by his nostrils...the breadth of his chest. For by his nostrils nature had given free passage for the high spirit which bubbled up from his heart. A certain charm hung about this man but was partly marred by a general air of the horrible... He was so made in mind and body that both courage and passion reared their crests within him and both inclined to war. His wit was manifold and crafty and able to find a way of escape in every emergency. In conversation he was well informed, and the answers he gave were quite irrefutable. This man who was of such a size and such a character was inferior to the Emperor alone in fortune and eloquence and in other gifts of nature."<br />
 <br />
A politique, Bohemund was resolved to engineer the enthusiasm of the crusaders to his own ends; and when his nephew Tancred left the main army at Heraclea, and attempted to establish a footing in Cilicia, the movement may have been already intended as a preparation for Bohemund's eastern principality. Bohemund was the first to get into position before Antioch (October 1097), and he took a great part in the siege of the city, beating off the Muslim attempts at relief from the east, and connecting the besiegers on the west with the port of St Simeon and the Genoese ships which lay there.<br />
 <br />
The capture of Antioch was due to his connection with Firuz, one of the commanders in the city; but he would not bring matters to an issue until the possession of the city was assured him (May 1098), under the terror of the approach of Kerbogha with a great army of relief, and with a reservation in favour of Alexius, if Alexius should fulfill his promise to aid the crusaders. But Bohemund was not secure in the possession of Antioch, even after its surrender and the defeat of Kerbogha; he had to make good his claims against Raymond of Toulouse, who championed the rights of Alexius. He obtained full possession in January 1099, and stayed in the neighbourhood of Antioch to secure his position, while the other crusaders moved southward to the capture of Jerusalem.<br />
 <br />
He came to Jerusalem at Christmas 1099, and had Dagobert of Pisa elected as Patriarch, perhaps in order to check the growth of a strong Lotharingian power in the city. It might seem that Bohemund was destined to found a great principality in Antioch, which would dwarf Jerusalem; he had a fine territory, a good strategical position and a strong army. But he had to face two great forces--the Byzantine Empire, which claimed the whole of his territories and was supported in its claim by Raymond of Toulouse, and the strong Muslim principalities in the north-east of Syria. Against these two forces he failed. In 1100 he was captured by Danishmend of Sivas, and he languished in prison until 1103. Tancred took his place; but meanwhile Raymond established himself with the aid of Alexius in Tripoli, and was able to check the expansion of Antioch to the south.<br />
 <br />
Ransomed in 1103 by the generosity of the Armenian prince Kogh Vasil, Bohemund made it his first object to attack the neighbouring Muslim powers in order to gain supplies. But in heading an attack on Harran, in 1104, he was severely defeated at Balak, near Rakka on the Euphrates (see Battle of Harran). The defeat was decisive; it made impossible the great eastern principality which Bohemund had contemplated. It was followed by a Greek attack on Cilicia; and despairing of his own resources, Bohemund returned to Europe for reinforcements in order to defend his position. His attractive personality won him the hand of Constance, the daughter of the French king, Philip I, and he collected a large army. Of this marriage wrote Abbot Suger:<br />
 <br />
    "Bohemund came to France to seek by any means he could the hand of the Lord Louis' sister Constance, a young lady of excellent breeding, elegant appearance and beautiful face. So great was the reputation for valour of the French kingdom and of the Lord Louis that even the Saracens were terrified by the prospect of that marriage. She was not engaged since she had broken off her agreement to wed Hugh, count of Troyes, and wished to avoid another unsuitable match. The prince of Antioch was experienced and rich both in gifts and promises; he fully deserved the marriage, which was celebrated with great pomp by the bishop of Chartres in the presence of the king, the Lord Louis, and many archbishops, bishops and noblemen of the realm."<br />
 <br />
Dazzled by his success, Bohemund resolved to use his army not to defend Antioch against the Greeks, but to attack Alexius. He did so; but Alexius, aided by the Venetians, proved too strong, and Bohemund had to submit to a humiliating peace (the Treaty of Devol, 1108), by which he became the vassal of Alexius, consented to receive his pay, with the title of Sebastos, and promised to cede disputed territories and to admit a Greek patriarch into Antioch. Henceforth Bohemund was a broken man. He died without returning to the East, and was buried at Canosa in Apulia, in 1111.<br />

King of the Salic Franks (481-511), King of France. (Came to throne atabout age 15.<br />
 <br />
SOURCES:<br />
Founder of the Empire of the Franks<br />
"Rulers of the World" by R.F.Tapsell<br />
 <br />
Born: circa 466, son of Childeric I, King des Francs and Basine Andovera de Turinge , Clovis I became King between the Summer of 481 and Autumn of 482. According to Gregoire de Tours, he was only about 15 years of age at the time. In any case he was quite young as he was called "juvenis". Timelines here are bound to be fraught with error since the custom of counting years from the time of Jesus Christ was not established until the 8th Century. Thus, both the Larousse and the History of France assert a birth date circa 466 whereas Stuart's "Royalty for Commoners" claims Clovis I was alive in the year 420! That date is necessary to claim that Sigebert I is the son of Childebert, son of Clovis, since Stuart claims Sigebert I was King of the Salic Francs from 481 to 511.<br />
 <br />
Significant-Other: Evochilde before 486 - Evochilde was a concubine. Note - between 486 and 507: King of the Franks, Clovis I vanquished the Romans at Soissons in 486. Syagrius, the "Roman King" takes refuge in Toulouse under the protection of the King of the Wisigoths, Alaric [who had just become King in 484]. By the end of the year, Clovis I forced Alaric to give up Syagrius, and Clovis I secretly has Syagrius put to death. From 487 to 490, Clovis I extended his kingdom all the way to the Loire River, however, he respects the border of the Wisigoths to the South and of the Burgundians to the South-West, as well as that of the riparian Francs to the East. From 490 to 495, Clovis is occupied with the liquidation of the Salic Franc dynasty North of Gaule. King Chararic of Tongres is decapitated, and King Ragnacaire of Cambrai is executed. Upon the request for aid from the Riparian Francs, Clovis I defeats the Alamans (Germans) at the Battle of Tolbiac in 496 thus bringing Champagne under his jurisdiction. In 500, he wages war against Gondebaud, King of Burgundy defeating him near Dijon. Gondebaud retreats to Avignon. In 502, on the Cure and the Cousin, Clovis I and Gondebaud seal an alliance. From April to June 507, the French Army attack the Wisigoths, whose Kingdom extends from the Mediterranean to the ocean, and cross the Loire, going up the Valley of Calin toward Poitiers and encounter the Visigoth Army in the plain of Vouille, 15 km West of Clain. Alaric II, King of the Visigoths is killed and the Wisigoths thus are defeated. By 507, thanks to the efforts of his son, Thierry, the entire Meridional Gaule falls into Clovis I's control. In 508, the Franc Army lays siege on Arles in order to secure Provence. Theodoric, King of the Ostrogoths, occupies Provence, and his general, Ibbas, crosses the Alps to deliver Arles from Clovis I's clutch. Theodoric conquers the Burgundians at Avignon and Orange and makes Amalaric, his grandson and son of Alaric II, King of the Wisigoths. Clovis I loses the Bas-Languedoc, then called Septimania.<br />
 <br />
Around 510, Clovis has Cloderic, King of the Riparian tribes who had fought in his support at Vouille, assassinated, and proclaims himself King of the Riparians. Thus, the Kingdom extends from the Pyrenees, to the ocean to beyond the Rhine. Upon his death, according to Frankish custom, his kingdom was divided among his four sons: Thierry, Clodomir, Childebert and Clotaire. Married circa 493: Sainte Clotilde de Bourgogne , daughter of Chilperic, King de Bourgogne and N?; Clotilde was a Merovingien. By the time Clovis I married her, he already had a son through his concubine. Clotilde contributed to the conversion of Clovis to Christianity. After his death, she retired to the monastery of Saint-Martin in Tours (France). Her Feast Day is 3 June. Baptized: on 25 December 496; When the Queen, Clotilde, convinced Clovis I to have their son Ingomer baptized, he relented. Shortly afterwards, the son died.<br />

 <br />
Béla IV (1206-1270) was the king of Hungary between 1235 and 1270.<br />
 <br />
Béla was the son of King András II and Gertrude of Meran. His mother was murdered by Hungarian magnates in 1213, when he was a boy. His father having failed to avenge Queen Gertrude, it was left to Béla to track down and punish his mother's murderers, a campaign which he finally completed some thirty years after her death.<br />
 <br />
In 1218 he was married to Maria Laskarina, the daughter of Emperor Theodore I Lascaris Nicaea. Their children were:<br />
   1. Kinga, married King Boleslaus V of Poland<br />
   2. King István V<br />
   3. Erzsébet, married Duke Henry XIII of Lower Bavaria<br />
   4. Margit, later canonized as St. Margaret in 1943. She lent her name to Margaret Island.<br />
 <br />
In 1238, Hungary was invaded by Kuman tribes fleeing the advancing Mongol hordes. Béla sought to ally with the Kumans, and so he granted them asylum and betrothed his son and heir Stephen to the daughter of a Kuman khan named Kuthen. The Kumans (originally a pagan shamanist people) converted to Christianity and were baptised. They fought beside the Hungarians against the Mongols.<br />
 <br />
Béla tried with little success to reestablish royal preeminence by reacquiring lost crown lands. His efforts, however, created a deep rift between the crown and the magnates just as the Mongols were sweeping westward across Russia toward Europe. Aware of the danger, Béla ordered the magnates and lesser nobles to mobilize. Few responded, and the Mongols routed Bela's army at Mohi on April 11, 1241. His ally Kuthen had been killed by mistrustful Hungarian lords in Pest just prior to the invasion.<br />

Béla fled first to Austria, where Duke Frederick of Babenberg held him for ransom, then to Dalmatia. The Mongols reduced Hungary's towns and villages to ashes and slaughtered half the population before news arrived in 1242 that the Great Ögedei Khan had died in Karakorum.

Richard Warren appears to have been a merchant, who resided in London,and became associated with the Pilgrims and the Mayflower through theMerchant Adventurers. Richard Warren participated in several of the earlyexplorations made by the Pilgrims in 1620, while looking for a place tosettle. He appears by land records to have been fairly well-to-do.<br />
 <br />
When he came over on the Mayflower, he left behind his wife and five daughters, planning to have them sent over after things were more settled in the Colony. His wife and daughters arrived in America in 1623, on the ship Anne.<br />
 <br />
Nathaniel Morton wrote in his book New England's Memorial, first published in 1669, the following about Richard Warren:<br />
 <br />
This year [1628] died Mr. Richard Warren, who was a useful instrument and during his life bare a deep share in the difficulties and troubles of the first settlement of the Plantation of New Plymouth.<br />
 <br />
Richard Warren is an ancestor to many famous Americans. Among them are Presidents Ulysses S. Grant and Franklin D. Roosevelt; and Alan B. Shepard, Jr., the first American in space and fifth man to walk on the moon.<br />

Information from Seymour Paul (originally from Don Abbott, Southern California Genealogical Society):<br />
Richard Warren of London, England; merchant, "a useful instrument."<br />
Member of exploration parties along Cape Cod; Probably Assistant Governor 1624-8. The 12th signer of the Mayflower Compact. Married Elizabeth Jouett Marsh in 1605 in London, England. Born 1580 to Christopher Warren and Alice Webb. Elizabeth Jouett Marsh was born 1583 and died 1673.<br />
An article, "Richard Warren and his Descendants" appearing in MD 3:45-51 covers all known records of him and his wife Elizabeth. Also a booklet published by the Mayflower Society covers him and his descendants to 4 generations. Little is known about Richard Warren, owing most probably to his death so shortly after settling in Plymouth. His wife Elizabeth was quite prominent in the colony afterwards. The only provably known source for his place of origin (according to [MD 3:45-6]) is from Mourt's Relations, where a short quote on p.15 says he was "a Londoner".<br />

 <br />
Richard Warren's parents have not been identified. Therefore, he does not have any known or proven royal ancestry as often claimed. A report on some of the searches for Richard Warren's parents can be found in MQ 51:109+. His wife Elizabeth's maiden name is unknown--it is not Marsh, Evans, or Jewett, three commonly thrown around myths. Richard's wife Elizabeth came to America on the Anne, 1623, bringing their five daughters.<br />

RICHARD WARREN AND HIS DESCENDANTS.<br />
Compiled from Original Sources, by GEORGE ERNEST BOWMAN.<br />
 <br />
Richard Warren was from London and joined the Leyden Pilgrims in July 1620 at Southampton, whence the Mayflower and the Speedwell first set sail for America. He was married in England, before 1611, to Elizabeth-, whose maiden name is unknown, and had by her five daughters, Mary, Anna (born about 1612), Sarah, Elizabeth and Abigail, who were left in England and came to Plymouth with their mother in 1623. Nothing more is known of his life before he joined the Pilgrims on the Mayflower, and there are very few references to him in the Plymouth Colony records and the works of contemporary writers, doubtless owing to his early death in 1628.Bradford's History mentions him only in the list of the Mayflower passengers,* and includes him among the few who were of enough importance to be distinguished by the title of "Mr." Nathaniel Morton, in the New England's Memorial, published at Cambridge, Mass., in 1669, was the first to print the names of the forty-one men who signed the Compact in the cabin of the Mayflower on Saturday, 11/21 November, 1620, and Richard Warren's name appears in this list. The following extract from Mourt's Relation contains the only reference yet found to the place from which Richard Warren came. It also shows us that he was a member of the third exploring party sent out while the Mayflower lay at anchor in Cape Cod Harbor. This party set out in the shallop on Wednesday, 6/16 December, 1620, and after many hardships, including a fight with the Indians early Friday morning, landed at Plymouth on the following Monday, 11/21 December, 1620.Wednesday the sixt of December, it was resolved our discoverers should set forth, for the day before was too fowle weather, and so they did, though* Mayflower Descendant, 1: 10, 24.

Chilpéric I of Neustria was born c.539 and died in September of 584. Hewas one of the sons of Clotaire I, a king of the Franks.<br />
 <br />
Immediately after the death of his father in 561 he endeavoured to take possession of the whole kingdom, seized the treasure amassed in the royal town of Berny and entered Paris. His brothers, however, compelled him to divide the kingdom with them, and Soissons, together with Amiens, Arras, Cambrai, Thérouanne, Tournai and Boulogne fell to Chilperic's share, but on the death of Charibert in 567 his estates were augmented.<br />
 <br />
When his brother Sigebert I married Brunhilda, Chilperic also wished to make a brilliant marriage. He had already repudiated his first wife, Audovera, and had taken as his concubine a serving-woman called Fredegund. He accordingly dismissed Fredegond, and married Brunhilda's sister, Galswintha. But he soon tired of his new partner, and one morning Galswintha was found strangled in her bed. A few days afterwards Chilperic married Fredegund.<br />
 <br />
This murder was the cause of long and bloody wars, interspersed with truces, between Chilperic and Sigebert. In 575 Sigebert was assassinated by Fredegond at the very moment when he had Chilperic at his mercy. Chilperic retrieved his position, took from Austrasia Tours and Poitiers and some places in Aquitaine, and fostered discord in the kingdom of the east during the minority of Childebert II. One day, however, while returning from the chase to the town of Chelles, Chilperic was stabbed to death.<br />
 <br />
Chilperic may be regarded as the type of Merovingian sovereigns. He was exceedingly anxious to extend the royal authority. He levied numerous imposts, and his fiscal measures provoked a great sedition at Limoges in 579. He wished to bring about the subjection of the church, and to this end sold bishoprics to the highest bidder, annulled the wills made in favour of the bishoprics and abbeys, and sought to impose upon his subjects a rationalistic conception of the Trinity.<br />
 <br />
He pretended to some literary culture, and was the author of some halting verse. He even added letters to the Latin alphabet, and wished to have the manuscripts rewritten with the new characters. The wresting of Tours from Austrasia and the seizure of ecclesiastical property provoked the bitter hatred of Gregory of Tours, by whom Chilperic was stigmatized as the Nero and the Herod of his time.<br />
 <br />
Chilpéric I died in September of 584 at Chelles, Île-de-France, France.<br />

Fredegund, or Frédégonde, (d. 597) was the Queen consort of Chilperic I,the Merovingian Frankish king of Soissons.<br />
 <br />
Originally a servant, Fredegund became Chilperic's mistress after he had murdered his wife and queen, Galswintha (c. 568). But Galswintha's sister, Brunhilda, in revenge against Chilperic, began a feud which lasted more than 40 years.<br />
 <br />
Fredegund is said to be responsible for the assassination of Sigebert I in 575 and made attempts on the lives of Guntram (her brother-in-law and the king of Burgundy), Childebert II (Sigebert's son), and Brunhilda.<br />
 <br />
After the mysterious assassination of Chilperic (584), Fredegund seized his riches and took refuge in the cathedral at Paris. Both she and her surviving son, Clotaire II, were protected by Guntram until he died in 592.<br />
 <br />
Said to be ruthlessly murderous and sadistically cruel, Fredegund perhaps has few rivals in monstrousness. And although she did not live to see it, her son's execution of Brunhilda bore the mark of Fredegund's hatred: Clotaire had the old queen, now in her sixties, stretched in agony upon the rack for three entire days, then watched her meet her death chained between four horses that were goaded to the four points of the compass, tearing her body asunder.<br />

Robert Guiscard (i.e. "the resourceful") (c. 1015 - 1085) was the most remarkable of the Norman adventurers who conquered Southern Italy and Sicily.<br />
 <br />
From 999 to 1059 the Normans were pure mercenaries, serving either Greeks or Lombards. Then Sergius of Naples, by installing the leader Rainulf in the fortress of Aversa in 1029, gave them their first pied-à-terre, allowing them to begin an organized conquest of the land.<br />
 <br />
In 1035 there arrived William Iron-Arm and Drogo, the two eldest sons of Tancred of Hauteville, a petty noble of Coutances in Normandy. The two joined in the organized attempt to wrest Apulia from the Greeks, who by 1040 had lost most of that province. In 1042 Melfi was chosen as the Norman capital, and in September of that year the Normans elected as their count William Iron-Arm, who was succeeded in turn by his brothers Drogo, "Comes Normannorum totius Apuliae e Calabriae", and Humphrey, who arrived about 1044. 1047 saw the arrival of Robert, the sixth son of Tancred of Hauteville, who was tall in stature, and had blonde colouring, blue eyes, and a powerful voice.<br />
 <br />
Guiscard soon rose to distinction. The Lombards turned against their allies and Leo IX determined to expel the Norman freebooters. The army which he led towards Apulia in 1053 was, however, overthrown at Civitate on the Fortore by the Normans, united under Humfrey, Guiscard, and Richard of Aversa. In 1057 Robert succeeded Humfrey as count of Apulia and, in company with Roger, his youngest brother, carried on the conquest of Apulia and Calabria, while Richard conquered the principality of Capua.<br />
 <br />
The Papacy, foreseeing the breach with the emperor over investitures, then resolved to recognize the Normans and secure them as allies. Therefore at Melfi, on August 23, 1059, Nicholas II invested Robert with Apulia, Calabria, and Sicily, and Richard with Capua. Guiscard, "by Grace of God and St Peter duke of Apulia and Calabria and future lord of Sicily", agreed to hold by annual rent of the Holy See and to maintain its cause.<br />
 <br />
In the next twenty years he made an amazing series of conquests. Invading Sicily with Roger, the brothers captured Messina (1061) and Palermo (1072). Bari was reduced (April 1071), and the Greeks finally ousted from southern Italy. The territory of Salerno was already Robert's; in December 1076 he took the city, expelling its Lombard prince Gisulf, whose sister Sikelgaita he had married. The Norman attacks on Benevento, a papal fief, alarmed and angered Gregory VII, but pressed hard by the emperor, Henry IV, he turned again to the Normans, and at Ceprano (June 1080) reinvested Robert, securing him also in the southern Abruzzi, but reserving Salerno.<br />
 <br />
Guiscard's last enterprise was his attack on the Greek Empire, a rallying ground for his rebel vassals. He contemplated seizing the throne of the Basileus and took up the cause of Michael VII, who had been deposed in 1078 and to whose son his daughter had been betrothed. He sailed with 16,000 men against the empire in May 1081, and by February 1082 had occupied Corfu and Durazzo, defeating the emperor Alexius before the latter (the Battle of Dyrrhachium, October 1081). He was, however, recalled to the aid of Gregory VII, besieged in San Angelo by Henry IV (June 1083).<br />
 <br />
Marching north with 36,000 men he entered Rome and forced Henry to retire, but an émeute of the citizens led to a three days' sack of the city (May 1084), after which Guiscard escorted the pope to Rome. His son Bohemund, for a time master of Thessaly, had now lost the Greek conquests. Robert, returning to restore them, occupied Corfu and Kephalonia, but died of fever in the latter on July 15 1085, in his 70th year. He was buried in S. Trinità at Venosa.<br />
 <br />
Guiscard was succeeded by Roger "Borsa", his son by Sikelgaita; Bohemund, his son by an earlier Norman wife Alberada, being set aside. At his death Robert was duke of Apulia and Calabria, prince of Salerno and suzerain of Sicily. His successes had been due not only to his great qualities but to the "entente" with the Papal See. He created and enforced a strong ducal power which, however, was met by many baronial revolts, one being in 1078, when he demanded from the Apulian vassals an "aid" on the betrothal of his daughter. In conquering such wide territories he had little time to organize them internally. In the history of the Norman kingdom of Italy Guiscard remains essentially the hero and founder, as his nephew Roger II is the statesman and organizer.From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia.<br />

Note - between 523 and 560: In accordance with Salic Law, upon Clovis I's death, his four sons [Thierry, the eldest and born from an unknown concubine before Clovis was married, and the other three, Clodomir, Childebert and Clotaire, divided the kingdom not unlike a cake, but with unequal parts. Clotaire, the youngest, received the most primitive lands, extending from the charbonniere forest [the North of Gaule] to the Somme River and beyond to include Noyon, Soissons and Laon. Soissons was its capital. The brothers constantly engaged in bloody fights in order to augment their holdings. In 523, three of Clovis I's sons, Clotaire, Childebert and Clodomir, launch their first campaign against the Burgundians. They catch Sigismond=Zygmund, out of the Monastery of Agaune, as well as his wife and his children. They are given to the custody of Clodomir. He has the entire family murdered by throwing them into a well at Saint-Peravy-la-Coulombe [near Patay] . Clotaire I became King of Orleans in 526 and King of Austrasie in 555. He was known for his cruelty and plotted and implemented the murder of his brother's (Clodomir) sons with Childebert, his other brother. In July through December 524, two of Clodomir's sons thus are murdered. Clodomir himself had died at the Battle of Vezeronce [in Isere] on 25 June 524. Clotaire gets Tours and Poitiers. In 531 Thierry and Clotaire I are occupied in battle against the Thuringians. Their King, Hermanefried died in combat by falling from a rempart in Tolbiac [with a little push] . His mother, Radegonde, who is among the captives, becomes Clotaire's third wife. In 532, Clotaire and Childebert begin their third campaign against the Burgundians. This time, they take Autun. Upon Thierry;s death in 534, his lands are divided, and Clotaire gets the entire southern portion of Thierry's holdings including Grenoble, Die and neighboring cities.<br />
 <br />
In 536, Clotaire obtains the northern part of Provence encompassing Orange, Carpentras and Gap from Vitiges, King of the Ostrogoths. When Theobald dies in 555, Clotaire gives the Auvergne to his son, Chramne. The next year, Clotaire would fail in his campaign against the Saxons, but they will continue to pay him an annual tribute of 500 cows. Chramne rebels and fights against his father. Upon Childebert's death 23 December 558, he reunited all parts of the Frankish kingdom, and Clotaire becomes sole King of the Francs. The following year, his son, Chramne again rebels, but has to seek refuge with the Count of Brittany, Conober who is established in Vannes. In 560, they lose to Clotaire and Chramne, his wife and their children are burnt alive on the orders of Clotaire. Married circa 547: Radegonde, Princess de Turinge , daughter of Hermanefried, King de Turinge (8164) and N? ; The Thuringians had been submitted to the Francs. Clotaire and his half-brother Thierry had led a brutal campaign against them and had crushed them on the banks of the Saale in 531. Among Clotaire's share of the bounty was a beautiful young girl, the Christian Princess Radegonde. Radegonde was Clotaire I's third legitimate wife, and fifth mate. Clotaire I was about 50 years old.<br />

 <br />
From Wikipedia<br />
 <br />
Clotaire I (or Chlothar or Chloderic) (497 - 561), a king of the Franks, was one of the four sons of Clovis. He was born about 497 in Soissons in the Aisne, département, Picardie, France.<br />
 <br />
On the death of his father in 511 he received as his share of the kingdom the town of Soissons, which he made his capital, the cities of Laon, Noyon, Cambrai and Maastricht, and the lower course of the Meuse River. But he was very ambitious, and sought to extend his domain.<br />
 <br />
He was the chief instigator of the murder of his brother Chlodomer's children in 524, and his share of the spoils consisted of the cities of Tours and Poitiers. He took part in the various expeditions against Burgundy, and after the destruction of that kingdom in 534 obtained Grenoble, Die and some of the neighbouring cities.<br />
 <br />
When Provence was ceded to the Franks by the Ostrogoths, he received the cities of Orange, Carpentras and Gap. In 531 he marched against the Thuringii with his brother Theuderich (Thierry) I, and in 542 with his brother Childebert I against the Visigoths of Spain. On the death of his great-nephew Theodebald in 555, Clotaire annexed his territories; and on Childebert's death in 558 he became king of all Gaul.<br />
 <br />
He also ruled over the greater part of Germany, made expeditions into Saxony, and for some time exacted from the Saxons an annual tribute of 500 cows. The end of his reign was troubled by internal dissensions, his son Chram rising against him on several occasions. Following Chram into Brittany, where the rebel had taken refuge, Clotaire shut him up with his wife and children in a cottage, to which he set fire. Overwhelmed with remorse, he went to Tours to implore forgiveness at the tomb of St Martin, and died shortly afterwards.<br />

Baldwin of Bourcq (died August 21, 1131) was the second count of Edessafrom 1100 to 1118, and the third king of Jerusalem from 1118 until hisdeath.<br />
 <br />
Ancestry<br />
Baldwin was the son of Hugh, count of Rethel, and his wife Melisende; Hugh, son of Baldwin of Rethel and Ida of Boulogne, was a first cousin of Eustace III of Boulogne, Godfrey of Bouillon, and Baldwin of Boulogne, who were sons of Ida of Lorraine and Eustace II, Ida of Boulogne's brother. Baldwin of Bourcq was thus the first cousin (once removed) of the brothers Eustace III, Godfrey, and Baldwin, whom he followed on the First Crusade in 1096.<br />
 <br />
Count of Edessa<br />
In the aftermath of the crusade, Baldwin of Boulogne became the first count of Edessa, while Baldwin of Bourcq entered the service of Bohemund of Taranto, Prince of Antioch, acting as an ambassador between Antioch and Edessa. Baldwin of Bourcq also became regent of the Principality, when Bohemund was taken prisoner by the Danishmends in 1100. That year, Baldwin of Boulogne was elected king of Jerusalem upon the death of Godfrey, and Baldwin of Bourcq was appointed count of Edessa in his stead. As count, in 1101 Baldwin married Morphia of Melitene, the daughter of the Armenian prince Gabriel of Melitene. He also helped ransom Bohemund from the Danishmends, preferring Bohemund to his nephew Tancred, who was now regent.<br />
 <br />
In 1102 Baldwin and Tancred assisted King Baldwin against the Egyptians at Ascalon. In 1104 the Seljuk Turks invaded Edessa, and with help from Antioch Count Baldwin met them at the Battle of Harran. The battle was disastrous and Count Baldwin was captured; Tancred became regent of Edessa in his absence. Tancred and Bohemund preferred to ransom their own Seljuk prisoners for money rather than an exchange for Baldwin, and the count remained in captivity in Mosul until 1108, when he was ransomed for 60 000 dinars by Joscelin of Courtenay. Tancred refused to restore Edessa to him, but with the support of the Armenians, Byzantines, and even the Seljuks, Tancred was forced to back down. In 1109, after reconciling with Tancred, the two participated in the capture of Tripoli.<br />
 <br />
King of Jerusalem<br />
Upon the death of Baldwin I in 1118, the crown was offered to the king's elder brother Eustace III, but Joscelin of Courtenay insisted that the crown pass to Baldwin of Bourcq, despite Count Baldwin having exiled Joscelin from Edessa in 1113. Baldwin of Edessa accepted and was crowned king of Jerusalem as Baldwin II on Easter Sunday, April 14, 1118. Almost immediately, the kingdom was simultaneously invaded by the Seljuks from Syria and the Fatimids from Egypt, although by showing himself ready and willing to defend his territory, Baldwin forced the Muslim army to back down without a battle. In 1119, the crusader Principality of Antioch was invaded, and Baldwin hurried north with the army of Jerusalem. Roger of Salerno, prince of Antioch, would not wait for Baldwin's reinforcements, and the Antiochene army was destroyed in a battle the crusaders came to call Ager Sanguinis (the Field of Blood). Although it was a crushing blow, Baldwin helped Antioch recover and drove out the Seljuks later that year.<br />
 <br />
Around this time, the first two military orders were created. In 1118, Hughes de Payens founded the Knights Templar in Jerusalem, while the Knights Hospitaller, which had been founded in 1113, evolved into a military order from the charitable order that they had originally been. Baldwin also called the Council of Nablus in 1120, where he probably established the first written laws for the kingdom, and extended rights and privileges to the growing bourgeois communities.<br />
 <br />
In 1122 Joscelin, who had been appointed count of Edessa when Baldwin became king, was captured in battle. Baldwin returned to the north to take over the regency of the county, but he too was taken captive by the Ortoqids while patrolling the borders of Edessa 1123, and was held captive with Joscelin. Eustace Grenier acted as regent in Jerusalem, and defeated an Egyptian invasion hoping to take advantage of the king's absence. Baldwin and Josceling escaped from captivity with help from the Armenians in 1124. Meanwhile, the crusaders besieged and captured Tyre, with help from a Venetian fleet. This would lead to the establishment of Venetian and other Italian trading colonies in the coastal cities of the kingdom, which were autonomous and free from taxes and military duties.<br />
 <br />
In 1125 Baldwin assembled the knights from all the crusader territories and met the Seljuks at the Battle of Azaz. Although the Seljuk army was much larger, the crusaders were victorious, and they restored much of the influence they had lost after the Ager Sanguinis. Had Antioch and Edessa not been fighting amongst themselves after the battle, Baldwin may have been able to attack Aleppo; however, Aleppo and Mosul were soon united under Zengi in 1128. Unable to attack either of those cities, Baldwin attempted to take Damascus in 1129 with the help of the Templars, but the attempt failed.<br />
 <br />
Succession<br />
Also assisting Baldwin during the attack on Damascus was his new son-in-law, Fulk V of Anjou. Baldwin had no sons with Morphia, but four daughters: Melisende, Alice, Hodierna, and Ioveta. In 1129 Baldwin named Melisende his heir, and arranged for her to marry Fulk. His daughters Alice and Hodierna also married important princes, Bohemund II of Antioch and Raymond II of Tripoli respectively (his fourth daughter Ioveta became a nun in Bethany). In 1131 Baldwin fell sick and died on August 21, and was buried in the Church of the Holy Sepulchre. Melisende, by law the heir to the kingdom, succeeded him with Fulk as her consort. The new queen and king were crowned on September 14.<br />

Theodore Lascaris (d. 1222), emperor of Nicaea, was born of a nobleByzantine family.<br />
 <br />
He became the son-in-law of the Byzantine Emperor Alexius III and distinguished himself during the sieges of Constantinople by the Latins (1203-1204). After the capture of the city he gathered a band of fugitives in Bithynia and established himself in the town of Nicaea, which became the chief rallying-point for his countrymen.<br />
 <br />
Relieved of the danger of invasion by a Latin force which had defeated him in 1204 but was recalled to Europe by a Bulgarian invasion, he set to work to form a new Byzantine state in Asia Minor, and in 1206 assumed the title of emperor.<br />
 <br />
During the next years Theodore was beset by enemies surrounding his fledgling state. He maintained himself stubbornly in defensive campaigns against the Latin emperor Henry of Flanders, defeated his rival Alexius I, emperor of Trebizond, and carried out a successful counter-attack upon Kay Khusrau I, the sultan of Rüm (also called the sultan of Iconium or Konya), who had been instigated to war by the deposed Alexius III.<br />
 <br />
Theodore's crowning victory was gained in 1210, when in a battle near Pisidian Antioch he captured Alexius and wrested the town itself from the Turks.<br />
 <br />
At the end of his reign he ruled over a territory roughly conterminous with the old Roman provinces of Asia and Bithynia. Though there is no proof of higher qualities of statesmanship in him, by his courage and military skill he enabled the Byzantine nation not merely to survive, but ultimately to beat back the Latin invasion.<br />
 <br />
Family<br />
By his first wife, Anna Komnena Angelina, the daughter of the Emperor Alexius III, Theodore Lascaris had two daughters: Eirene Laskarina (married John III Ducas Vatatzes) and Maria Laskarina (married King Bela IV of Hungary).<br />
 <br />
After Anna Angelina died in 1212, Theodore Lascaris remarried to Philippa of Armenia, the daughter of King Ruben III of Armenia. This marriage was annuled a year later, and the son born to them, Constantine, was disinherited.<br />
 <br />
Theodore Lascaris married thirdly Marie de Courtney, the daughter of Peter of Courtenay and Yolanda of Flanders, but they had no children.<br />

Radegund was born to King Berthar, one of the three kings of Thuringia (akingdom located in present day Germany), some time in the first half ofthe 6th century.<br />
 <br />
Radegund's uncle, Hermanfrid, killed Berthar in battle, orphaning her. Then, after allying with the Frankish King Theuderic, Hermanfrid defeated his other brother Baderic. However, having crushed his brothers and seized control of Thuringia, Hermanfrid reneged on his deal with Theuderic to share sovereignty.<br />
 <br />
In 531 Theuderic returned to Thuringia with his brother Clotaire I. Together they defeated Hermanfrid and conquered his kingdom. Clotaire I also took charge of Radegund, taking her back to Merovingian Gaul with him and making her his wife.<br />
 <br />
Radegund was one of Clotaire Iʼs four wives (the other three being Chunsina, Ingund and Ingundʼs sister Aregund). She bore him no children, and, after Clotaire I had her brother assassinated, she turned to God, founding a nunnery in Poitiers.<br />
 <br />
She was a friend of the poet Venantius Fortunatus and a contemporary of Gregory of Tours. She died on 13 August 586 and her funeral, which both men attended, was three days later.<br />

Alfonso VII of Castile (March 1, 1104/5 - August 21, 1157), nicknamed theEmperor, was the king of Castile and Leon since 1126, son of Urraca ofCastile and Count Raymond of Burgundy.<br />
 <br />
Alfonso was a dignified and somewhat enigmatic figure. A vague tradition had always assigned the title of emperor to the sovereign who held Leon. This sovereign was considered the most direct representative of the Visigoth kings, who were themselves the representatives of the Roman empire. But though given in charters, and claimed by Alfonso VI of Castile and Alfonso I of Aragon, the title had been little more than a flourish of rhetoric.<br />
 <br />
In 1128 he married Berenguela of Barcelona, daughter of Ramon Berenguer III, Count of Barcelona. She died in 1149; their children were:<br />
   1. Sancho III of Castile (1134-1158)<br />
   2. Ferdinand II of Leon (1137-1188)<br />
   3. Sancha (1137-1179), married Sancho VI of Navarre<br />
   4. Constanza (1141-1160), married Louis VII of France<br />
 <br />
Alfonso remarried in 1152 to Richeza of Poland, the daughter of Wladislaus II the Exile of Poland. Their daughter was Sancha (1155-1208), the wife of Alfonso II of Aragon. His illegitimate daughter, Urraca, married Garcia IV of Navarre.<br />
 <br />
Alfonso VII was crowned emperor in 1135 after the death of Alfonso I. The weakness of Aragon enabled him to make his superiority effective. He appears to have striven for the formation of a national unity, which Spain had never possessed since the fall of the Visigoth kingdom. The elements he had to deal with could not be welded together.<br />
 <br />
Alfonso was at once a patron of the church, and a protector if not a supporter of the Muslims, who formed a large part of his subjects. His reign ended in an unsuccessful campaign against the rising power of the Almohades. Though he was not actually defeated, his death in the pass of Muradel in the Sierra Morena, while on his way back to Toledo, occurred in circumstances which showed that no man could be what he claimed to be -- "king of the men of the two religions."<br />

She had been married as a child to Raymond of Burgundy, who died in September 1107. They had two small children: Infante Alfonso Raḿırez (born 1104) and the Infanta Sancha (born before 1095). Now a widow, Urraca was ruler of Galicia. She was also her father's only surviving legitimate child, and now the heiress to Castile. King Alfonso VI selected a a new husband for her, and his choice fell on Alfonso I of Aragon. Urraca and Alfonso of Aragon were married in 1109.<br />
 <br />
Alfonso was renowned as a great warrior; according to the chronicler Ibn al-Athir, he once remarked that a real soldier lives with men, not with women. Urraca accused him of being physically abusive to her, and their inability to produce a child created a further rift between them. She took a lover, Count Gómez González, and the royal couple were separated by 1111.<br />
 <br />
Her reign was disturbed by strife among the powerful nobles and especially by constant warfare with her husband, who had seized her lands. Their marriage was annulled in 1114, and Urraca never remarried, though she took several lovers. Another thorn in her side was her brother-in-law Henry, the husband of her half-sister Teresa of Leon. He alternatively allied with Alfonso I of Aragon, then betrayed Alfonso a better offer came from Urraca's court. After his death in 1112 his widow Teresa still contested ownership of lands with Urraca. With the aid of her son, Alfonso Raimúndez, Urraca was able to win back much of her domain and ruled successfully for many years.<br />
 <br />
According to the Chronicon Compostellanum, Urraca died in childbirth in 1126. The father was her lover, Count Pedro González of Lara. She was succeeded by her legitimate son, Alfonso VII.<br />

From Wikipedia<br />
 <br />
Alfonso VI (before June 1040 - July 1, 1109), nicknamed the Brave, was king of León from 1065 to 1109 and king of Castile since 1072 after his brother's death. Much romance has gathered round his name.<br />
 <br />
In the cantar de gesta of the Cid, he plays the part attributed by medieval poets to the greatest kings, and to Charlemagne himself. He is alternately the oppressor and the victim of heroic and self-willed nobles - the idealized types of the patrons for whom the jongleurs and troubadours sang. He is the hero of a cantar de gesta which, like all but a very few of the early Spanish songs, like the cantar of Bernardo del Carpio and the Infantes of Lara, exists now only in the fragments incorporated in the chronicle of Alfonso the Wise or in ballad form.<br />
 <br />
His flight from the monastery of Sahagun, where his brother Sancho endeavoured to imprison him, his chivalrous friendship for his host Almamun of Toledo, caballero aunque moro, "a knight although a Moor", the passionate loyalty of his vassal Peranzules, and his brotherly love for his sister Urraca of Zamora, may owe something to the poet who took him as a hero.<br />
 <br />
They are the answer to the poet of the nobles who represented the king as having submitted to taking a degrading oath at the hands of Ruy Diaz de Vivar (El Cid), in the church of Santa Gadea at Burgos, and as having then persecuted the brave man who defied him.<br />
 <br />
When every allowance is made, Alfonso VI stands out as a strong man fighting as a king whose interest was law and order, and who was the leader of the nation in the reconquest. He impressed himself on the arabs as a very fierce and astute enemy, but as a keeper of his word. A story of Muslim origin, which is probably no more historical than the oath of Santa Gadea, tells of how he allowed himself to be tricked by Ibn Ammar, the favourite of Al Mutamid, the king of Seville. They played chess for an extremely beautiful table and set of men, belonging to Ibn Ammar. Table and men were to go to the king if he won. If Ibn Ammar gained he was to name the stake. The latter did win and demanded that the Christian king should spare Seville. Alfonso kept his word.<br />
 <br />
Whatever truth may lie behind the romantic tales of Christian and Muslim, we know that Alfonso represented in a remarkable way the two great influences then shaping the character and civilization of Spain.<br />
 <br />
Alfonso married at least five times, had two mistresses, and one fiancee. His first wife was Agnes, daughter of William VII of Aquitaine. They had no children and were divorced due to consanguity. The second wife was Constance of Burgundy; their daughter was Urraca of Castile. Prior to this he was betrothed to Agatha, one of the daughters of William I of England. Two later wives, Beatrice and Bertha, are of unknown origin. By his mistress Jimena Muñoz, daughter of the Count of Asturias, he had two illegitimate daughters: Teresa of Leon and Elvira of Castile.<br />
 <br />
At the instigation, it is said, of his wife Constance, he brought the Cistercian Order into Spain, established them in Sahagun, chose a French Cistercian, Bernard, as the first archbishop of Toledo after the reconquest on May 25, 1085, married his daughters, Urraca of Castile, the legitimate and Teresa of Leon, the illegitimate, to French princes, and in every way forwarded the spread of French influence - then the greatest civilizing force in Europe. He also drew Spain nearer to the Papacy, and it was his decision which established the Roman ritual in place of the old missal of Saint Isidore - the Mozarabic rite.<br />
 <br />
On the other hand he was very open to Arabic influence. He protected the Muslims among his subjects and struck coins with inscriptions in Arabic letters. After the death of Constance he perhaps married and he certainly lived with Zaida, said to have been a daughter-in-law of Al Mutamid, Muslim king of Seville. Alfonso's wife Isabel, who bore him the only son, Sancho, among his many children, may have been this Zaida, who became a Christian under the name of Maria or Isabel. Isabel also bore him two daughters, Elvira Alfonso (who married Roger II of Sicily) and Sancha (wife of Rodrigo Gonzalez de Lara).<br />
 <br />
Sancho, Alfonso's designated successor, was slain at the battle of Ucles in 1108.<br />

Reginald supported Giles in his rebellions against King John. They were both active against the King in the barons' war. Neither was present at the signing of Magna Carta because they were still rebels who refused to compromise King John aquiesced to Reginald's claims to the de Braose estates in Wales in May 1216. He became Lord of Brecon, Abergavenny, Builth and other Marcher Lordships but was very much a vassal of Llewelyn Fawr, Prince of Gwynedd and now his father-in-law. Henry III restoredReginald to favour and the Bramber estates (confiscated from William by King John) in 1217. At this seeming betrayal, Rhys and Owain, Reginald's nephews who were princes of Deheubarth, were incensed and they took Builth (except the castle). Llewelyn Fawr also became angry and beseiged Brecon. Reginald eventually surrendered to Llewelyn and gave up Seinenydd (Swansea). By 1221 they were at war again with Llewelyn laying seige to Builth. The seige was relieved by Henry III's forces. From this time on Llewelyn tended to support the claims of Reginald's nephew John concerning the de Braose lands.<br />

Reginald was a witness to the re-issue of Magna Carta by Henry III in1225.<br />

Odin is considered to be the supreme god of late Germanic and Norsemythology. His role, like many of the Norse pantheon, is complex: he isgod of both wisdom and war. He is also attributed as being a god ofmagic, poetry, victory, and the hunt.<br />
 <br />
His name is, in Icelandic/Old Norse Óđinn; Swedish Oden; English/Old English (and Old Saxon) Wõden; Old Franconian Wodan; Alemannic Wuodan; German Wotan or Wothan; Lombardic Godan. Although its precise mythological meaning is debated, the name is formed from òđ and -in. In Old Norse, òđ means by itself '"wit, soul" and in compounds "fierce power, energy;" the suffix -in means "master, lord." Thus, Odin is lord of the life force.<br />
 <br />
Eddaic Odin<br />
According to the Edda, Odin was a son of Bestla and Bor and brother of Vé and Vili and together with these brothers he cast down the frost giant Ymir and created the world from Ymir's body. The three brothers are often mentioned together. "Wille" is the German word for "will" (English), "Weh" is the German word (Gothic wai) for "woe" (English: great sorrow, grief, misery) but is more likely related to the archaic German "Wei" meaning 'sacred'.<br />
 <br />
Odin fathered his most famous son Thor on Jord 'Earth'. But his wife and consort was the goddess Frigg who in the best-known tradition was the loving mother of their son Baldr). By the giantess Gŕıđr, Odin was the father of V́ıđarr and by Rind he was father of Vali. Also many royal families claimed descent from Odin through other sons. For traditions about Odin's offspring see Sons of Odin.<br />
 <br />
Anglo-Saxon Woden<br />
The Anglo-Saxon tribes brought Woden to England around the 5th and 6th centuries, continuing his worship until conversion to Christianity in the 8th and 9th centuries. Woden is the carrier-off of the dead, but not necessarily with the attributes of Norse Odin. Woden is also the leader of the Wild Hunt. The familial relationships are the same between Woden and the other Anglo-saxon gods as they are for the Norse.<br />
 <br />
According to the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle and the Historia Britonum, Woden had the sons Wecta, Baeldaeg, Casere and Wihtlaeg.<br />
    * Wecta's line is continued by Witta, Wihtgils, Hengest and Horsa, and the Kings of Kent.<br />
    * Baeldaeg's line is continued by Brona, Frithugar, Freawine, Wig, Gewis, Esla, Elesa, Cerdic and the Kings of Wessex.<br />
    * Casere's line is continued by Tytmon, Trygils, Hrothmund, Hryp, Wilhelm, Wehha, Wuffa and the Kings of East Anglia.<br />
    * Wihtlaeg's line is continued by Wermund king of Angel, Offa, Angeltheow, Eomer, Icel and the Kings of Mercia.<br />
 <br />
Anglo-Saxon literature starts at about the time of the conversion from the old religion. Although whatever stories recording his part in the lives of men and the gods are lost, Woden's name survived in many settlement names and geographical features.<br />
    * Wansdyke - Woden's embankment<br />
    * Grimsdyke - From Grim, "hooded" a description of his appearance<br />
    * Wednesbury - Woden's burgh<br />

Charles of Anjou (1227-1285), also Charles I of Sicily. He was King of Sicily 1262-1282 (and under that title, King of Naples 1282-1285), King of Albania 1272-1285, King of Jerusalem 1277-1285, Prince of Achaea 1278-1285, Count of Provence and Forcalquier 1246-1285, and Count of Anjou and Maine 1247-1285. He was the posthumous son of Louis VIII of France and Blanche of Castile, and hence brother to Louis IX of France and Alphonse of Toulouse. He conquered the Kingdom of Sicily from the Hohenstaufen in 1266 and began to acquire lands in the eastern Mediterranean. However, the Sicilian Vespers freed Sicily from his control, and the resulting war forced him to abandon his plans to reassemble the Latin Empire.<br />
 <br />
Early Life<br />
Charles was born in 1227, shortly after the death of his father, King Louis VIII. In his will, his father had left to him (should he be male), the Counties of Anjou and Maine, with which he was invested in 1247. The affection of his mother Blanche seems largely to have been bestowed upon his brother Louis; and Louis tended to favor his elder brothers Robert of Artois and Alphonse. The self-reliance this engendered in Charles may account for the tremendous drive and ambition he showed in his later life.<br />
 <br />
Marriage and Children<br />
Charles was wedded to Beatrice of Provence on January 31, 1246, in Aix-en-Provence. Beatrice was the youngest daughter of Ramon Berenguer IV, Count of Provence and Forcalquier, who had died on August 19, 1245. As his elder three daughters had all married kings and received substantial dowries, Raymond settled his entire inheritance upon Beatrice, making Charles Count of Provence and Forcalquier. They had the following children:<br />
   1. Louis (1248, Nicosia)<br />
   2. Blanche (1250 - July 1269), married 1265 Count Robert III of Flanders<br />
   3. Beatrice (1252-1275), married October 15, 1273 at Foggia to Philip of Courtenay, titular Emperor of Constantinople<br />
   4. Charles II of Naples (1254 - 1309)<br />
   5. Philip (1256 - January 1, 1277), King of Thessalonica and Prince of Achaea, married May 28, 1271 to Isabella Villehardouin<br />
   6. Robert (1258-1265)<br />
   7. Elizabeth or Maria (1261 - c. 1300), married bef. September 1272 to Ladislas IV of Hungary<br />
 <br />
Accession in Provence<br />
Upon his accession as Count of Provence and Forcalquier in 1246, Charles rapidly found himself in difficulties. His sisters-in-law felt cheated by their father's will, and the Dowager Countess Beatrice of Savoy claimed the entire County of Forcalquier and the usufruct of Provence as her jointure. Furthermore, while Provence was technically a part of the Kingdom of Burgundy and hence of the Holy Roman Empire, in practice it was free of central authority. The recent counts had governed with a light hand, and the nobilities and cities (three of which, Marseilles, Arles, and Avignon were Imperial cities technically separate from the county) had enjoyed great liberties. Charles, in constrast, was disposed towards a rigid administration, and aroused considerable hostility by his punctilious insistence on enjoying his full rights and fees. In 1247, while Charles had gone to France to receive the Counties of Anjou and Maine, the local nobility (represented by Barral of Baux and Boniface of Castellane) joined with Beatrice and the three Imperial cities to form a defensive league against him. Unfortunately for Charles, he had promised to join his brother on the Seventh Crusade. For the time being, Charles' only recourse was to compromise with Beatrice, allowing her to have Forcalquier and a third of the Provençal usufruct.<br />
 <br />
Seventh Crusade and Return<br />
Charles sailed with the rest of the Crusaders from Aigues-Mortes in 1248, and fought gallantly at Damietta and during the fighting around Mansourah. However, his piety does not seem to have matched that of his brother (Jean de Joinville relates a tale of Louis catching him gambling on the voyage from Egypt to Acre) and he returned with his brother Alphonse in May 1250. During his absence, open rebellion had broken out in Provence. Charles moved with his characteristic energy to suppress it, and Arles, Avignon, and Barral of Baux had surrendered to him by June 1251. Marseilles held out until July 1252, but then sued for peace. Charles imposed a lenient peace, but insisted on the recognition of his full panoply of comital rights, and acknowledgement of his suzerainity by Marseilles.<br />
 <br />
Wider Ambitions<br />
In November 1252, the death of his mother Blanche of Castile caused him to go north to Paris and assume the joint regency of the kingdom with his brother Alphonse. While in Paris, he was approached by envoys from Pope Innocent IV. Innocent was then seeking to detach the Kingdom of Sicily from the Holy Roman Empire (in the person of Conrad IV of Germany), and offered it to Charles, after his brother-in-law Richard, Earl of Cornwall had declined it. Alphonse, however, was cool to the idea; and King Louis forbade it outright. Balked, Charles took up the cause of Margaret II of Flanders against her son, John I, Count of Hainaut, and she granted him the County of Hainaut for his service. King Louis again disapproved, and on his return from Outremer in 1254 he returned Hainaut to John. The disappointed Charles returned to Provence, which had become restive again. The mediation of King Louis led to a settlement with Beatrice of Savoy, who returned Forcalquier and relinquished her claims for a cash payment and a pension. Marseilles had attempted to involve Pisa and Alfonso X of Castile in the quarrel, but they proved unreliable as allies, and a coup by the supporters of Charles resulted in the surrender of the city's political powers. Charles spent the next several years quietly increasing his power over various lordships on the borders of Provence. A final rebellion occurred in 1262, when he was absent in France; Boniface of Castellaine rebelled yet again, as did Marseilles and Hugh of Baux. However, Barral of Baux now remained loyal to Charles, and Charles quickly returned to scatter the rebels. The mediation of James I of Aragon brought about a settlement; while Marseilles was forced to dismantle its fortifications and surrender its arms, it otherwise went unpunished. Surprisingly, this lenity worked to good effect; hereafter, the Provençals proved staunch supporters of Charles, providing money and troops for his further conquests. Many of them were to be rewarded with high posts in his new dominions.<br />
 <br />
With the usurpation of the Sicilian throne from Conradin by Manfred of Sicily in 1258, the relationship between the Papacy and the Hohenstaufen had changed again. Instead of the boy Conradin, safely sequestered across the Alps, the Papacy now faced an able military leader in Italy. Accordingly, when negotiations broke down with Manfred in 1262, Pope Urban IV again took up the scheme of disseising the Hohenstaufen from the Kingdom, and offered the crown to Charles again. Manfred's own usurpation from Conradin told upon King Louis' scruples; this time, he was persuaded to admit the offer, and Charles ratified a treaty with the Pope in July 1263. The terms were heavily in favor of the Pope; the Kingdom must never be re-united with the Empire, and the King was never to hold Imperial or Papal office, or interfere with ecclesiastical matters in the Kingdom. Nevertheless, Charles accepted eagerly.<br />
 <br />
Conquest of Sicily<br />
Having endorsed the treaty, Charles could now play for time. With Manfred's troops advancing on the Papal States, Charles obtained an extensive renegotiation of the treaty on more favorable lines. As instructions went out to the clergy to submit contributions for the war, Urban IV died in October 1264 at Perugia, fleeing Manfred. This raised the possibility of a reversal of Papal policy. To underscore his resolve, he broke sharply with his previous policy of lenity and ordered the execution of Hugh of Baux and several other Provençal rebels, who had been in his hands for a year. Fortunately for Charles, the new Pope Clement IV was the former adviser of his brother Alphonse and strongly supported the accession of Charles. Charles entered Rome on May 23, 1265 and was proclaimed King of Sicily.<br />
 <br />
Charles was popular in Rome, where he was elected Senator, and his diplomacy had already undermined Manfred's support in northern Italy. While Charles' campaigns were delayed for lack of money, Manfred, curiously, idled away his time hunting in Apulia, while his support in the north of Italy dwindled. Charles was able to bring his main army through the Alps, and he and Beatrice were crowned on January 6, 1266. As Charles' army began an energetic campaign, Manfred suddenly shed his lethargy and moved to meet him. Worried that further delays might endanger the loyalty of his supporters, he attacked Charles' army, then in disarray from the crossing of the hills into Benevento, on February 26, 1266. In the Battle of Benevento that followed, Manfred's army was defeated in detail and he was killed in the melee. Upon his death, resistance throughout the Kingdom collapsed, and Charles was master of Sicily.<br />
 <br />
While Charles' administration in his new Kingdom was generally fair and honest, it was also stringent. As in Provence, he insisted on maximizing the revenues and privileges he could obtain from his new subjects. Discontent was high; but for now, Charles could focus on extending his power in northern Italy (which alarmed the Pope, who feared a powerful king of all Italy as much as he did an Emperor). But the Pope was willing to allow this; for in September 1267 Conradin marched south to reclaim the rights of the Hohenstaufen, and one of his agents instigated a revolt in Sicily. He entered Rome on July 24, 1268, where his arrival was wildly celebrated. At the Battle of Tagliacozzo, on August 23, 1268, it appeared he might win the day; but a sudden charge of Charles' reserve discomfited his army and he was forced to flee to Rome. Told it was no longer safe, he attempted to escape to Genoa, but was arrested and imprisoned in the Castello dell'Ovo in Naples. In a trial carefully managed by Charles, Conradin was condemned for treason, and he was beheaded on October 29, 1268. By the end of 1270, he had captured Lucera and put down the revolt in Sicily, executing many of the captured. With the whole kingdom powed beneath his strict, if fair, rule, he was ready to consider greater conquests.<br />
 <br />
Ambitions in the Latin Empire<br />
After the defeat of Manfred at Benevento, Charles immediately began to plan his expansion into the Mediterranean. Historically, the Kingdom of Sicily had at times controlled parts of the eastern Adriatic seaboard, and Manfred had been possessed of the island of Corfu and the towns of Butrinto, Avlona, and Suboto, which had formed the dowry of his wife Helena. Charles seized these at the end of 1266. From thence, he passed on to intrigue with the remaining nobility of the Latin Empire. In May 1267, he concluded the Treaty of Viterbo with the exiled Baldwin II of Constantinople and William II Villehardouin (through his chancellor Leonardo of Veruli). Taking advantage of the precarious situation of the remains of the Empire in the face of rising Greek power, he obtained confirmation of his possession of Corfu, the suzerain rights over Achaea, and sovereignty over most of the Aegean islands. Furthermore, the heirs of both the Latin princes were to marry children of Charles, and Charles was to have the reversion of the Empire and Principality should the couples have no heirs. With few options to check the Byzantine tide, he was well placed to dictate terms.<br />
 <br />
Charles' wife Beatrice died on September 23, 1267, and he immediately sought a new marriage to Margaret, daughter of Bela IV of Hungary. However, Margaret wished to be a nun (and was later canonized); Charles instead married (on November 18, 1268), Margaret, Countess of Tonnerre (1250 - September 4, 1308, Tonnerre), the daughter of Eudes of Burgundy. However, he was able to make a marital alliance with the Hungarians: his son Charles, Prince of Salerno married Maria, daughter of crown prince Stephen, while Charles' daughter Elizabeth married Stephen's son Ladislas.<br />
 <br />
Eighth Crusade<br />
Having thus made secure his position in the East, he began to prepare a crusade to recover the Latin Empire. Michael VIII Palaeologus was greatly alarmed at the prospect: he wrote to King Louis, suggesting that he was open to a voluntary union of the Roman and Latin churches, and poiting out the interference a descent on Constantinople would pose to Louis' own crusading plans. Louis took a dim view of his sincerity; but he was eager to take up the cross again, and he notified Charles of his intentions. Charles continued with his preparations against Constantinople, hoping the crusade might be postponed, but he also prepared to turn his brother's crusade to his own advantage. The Caliph of Tunis, Muhammed I al-Mustansir had been a vassal of Sicily, but had shaken off his allegiance with the fall of Manfred. However, there were rumors he might be sympathetic to Christianity. Accordingly, Charles suggested to his brother that the arrival of a crusade in his support might bring about Mustansir's conversion. Thus it was that Louis directed the Eighth Crusade against Tunis. Charles did not arrive until late in the day on August 25, 1270, only to find that his brother had died of dysentery that morning. Charles took command, and after a few skirmishes, Mustansir concluded a peace treaty and agreed to pay tribute to Charles. Illness continued to plague the army, however, and a storm devastated the fleet as it returned to Sicily. Charles was forced to postpone his designs against Constantinople again.<br />
 <br />
Conquest of Albania and Genoese War<br />
In February 1271, Charles began to expand his Adriatic possessions by capturing Durazzo, and he soon controlled much of the Albanian interior. In February 1272, he proclaimed himself King of Albania and appointed Gazzo Chinardo as his Vicar-General. He hoped to take up his expedition against Constantinople again, but was delayed by the rise Pope Gregory X, consecrated on March 27, 1272. Gregory had high hopes of reconciling Europe, unifying the Greek and Latin churches, and launching a new crusade: to that end, he announced the Council of Lyons, to be held in 1274, and worked to arrange the election of an Emperor.<br />
 <br />
In November 1272, the strained relations between Charles and Ghibelline-ruled Genoa finally broke into war. Ghibelline revolts broke out across the north of Italy, and increasingly occupied the attention of Charles, even as Michael Palaeologus was negotiating a union of churches with the Pope. At the same time, he had made contact with Genoa and was sending money to encourage the revolts in the north. At the apparently successful conclusion of the Council of Lyons, a Union of Churches was declared, and Charles and Philip of Courtenay were compelled to extend a truce with Michael. This was a blessing in disguise for Charles, for the Ghibellines now controlled most of the north, and he was forced to retreat from Piedmont in late 1275. In truth, Pope Gregory was not entirely displeased; he regarded north Italy as best dealt with by its new Emperor, Rudolph of Habsburg, and preferred that Charles be confined to the south. If he wished to make war, let him look to Outremer; and to this end, Gregory endorsed the sale to Charles of the claims of Maria of Antioch on the Kingdom of Jerusalem, which had been rejected by the Haute Cour there. On March 18, 1277, he bought her claim and assumed the title of King of Jerusalem, sending Roger of Sanseverino as his bailli to Acre. There Roger ousted Balian of Ibelin, the bailli of Hugh I and compelled the nobles to swear fealty. In the meantime, Gregory had been succeeded by Pope Innocent V, who arranged a peace between Charles and the Genoese.<br />
 <br />
Breakdown of the Union<br />
Meanwhile, in Constantinople, the Union of the Churches was proving difficult to arrange, and the Emperor Michael had great difficulty in imposing it on his people. Nevertheless, he persuaded Innocent of his sincerity in working towards it, and Charles was again forbidden to attack Constantinople. Knowing this, Michael began a campaign in Albania in late 1274, where he captured Berat and Butrinto. He also enjoyed some success in his campaigns in Euboea and the Peloponnese.<br />
 <br />
Affairs dragged on for several years, until the accession of Pope Martin IV on March 23, 1280. Pope Martin was a Frenchman, and lacked the evenhandedness of some of his recent precursors. He brought the full power of the Papacy into line behind Charles' plans. The Union, which had proved impossible to impose upon Constantinople, was called off, and Charles given authorization for the restoration of the Latin Empire.<br />
 <br />
He opened his campaign in Albania, where his general Hugh of Sully captured Butrinto from the Despotate of Epirus in 1280 and besieging Berat. A Byzantine army of relief under Michael Tarchaniotes arrived in March, 1281: Hugh of Sully was ambushed and captured, and his army put to flight. The Byzantines took possession of the interior of Albania. Nor was Charles particularly successful in Achaea, where he had become (by the Treaty of Viterbo) Prince of Achaea on the death of William II Villehardouin in 1278. His bailli Galeran of Ivry was defeated at Skorta in his one attempt to engage the Byzantines, and was recalled in 1280 and replaced by Philip of Lagonesse. Nonetheless, Charles was to launch the body of his crusade against Constantinople in the spring of 1282.<br />
 <br />
Sicilian Vespers<br />
But Michael had not been working upon the military front alone. Many Ghibelline officials had fled the Kingdom of Sicily to the court of Peter III of Aragon, who had married Constance, the daughter and heir of Manfred. Manfred's former chancellor, John of Procida, had arranged contact between Michael, Peter and the refugees at his court, and conspirators on the island of Sicily itself. Peter began to assemble a fleet at Barcelona, ostensibly for another Crusade to Tunis. In fact, the master-plan of John of Procida was to place Peter on the throne of Sicily, his Hohenstaufen inheritance. The result was the uprising known as the Sicilian Vespers, which was initiated in Palermo on March 29, 1282. It rapidly grew into a general massacre of the French in Sicily. A few officials notable for their good conduct were spared; and the city of Messina still held for Charles. But through the diplomatic errors of Charles' Vicar, Herbert of Orleans, Messina, too, revolted on April 28, 1282. Herbert retreated to the castle of Mategriffon, but was forced to abandon the Crusading fleet, which was burnt.<br />
 <br />
The news surprised Peter of Aragon, who had expected to intervene only after Charles had left for Constantinople. But the conspirators, aided by the Emperor Michael (who wished to see Charles balked in his expedition), had set the revolt in motion early. Peter did not immediately intervene; he sailed with the fleet to Tunis, where he discovered that the would-be convert on whose behalf the crusade had ostensibly been undertaken had been caught and executed. While he bided his time, the Sicilians made an appeal to Pope Martin to take the Communes of their cities under his protection. But Martin was far too deeply committed to Charles and French interests to heed them; instead, he excommunicated the rebels, the Emperor Michael, and the Ghibellines in north Italy. Charles gathered his forces in Calabria and made a landing near Messina and began a siege. Several attempts to assault the city were unsuccessful. Rejected by the Pope, the Sicilians now appealed to King Peter and Queen Constance; he duly accepted, and landed at Trapani on August 30, 1282. He was proclaimed King in Palermo on September 4; as the Archibishopric of Palermo was vacant, he could not immediately be crowned. In the face of the Aragonese landing, Charles was compelled to withdraw across the Straits of Messina into Calabria in September; but the Aragonese moved swiftly enough to destroy part of his army and most of his baggage. The Angevin house was forever ousted from Sicily.<br />
 <br />
War with Aragon<br />
Despite his retreat into Calabria, Charles remained in a strong position. His nephew, Philip III of France, was devoted to him; and Pope Martin regarded the rebellion as an affront both to French interests and his own rights as suzerain of the Kingdom. Both sides temporized; the expense of a long war might be disastrous for both, and Peter and Charles arranged for a judicial duel, with a hundred knights apiece, on June 1, 1283 at Bordeaux. Skirmishes and raids continued to occur: in January 1283, Aragonese guerillas attacked Catona and killed Count Peter I of Alençon in his hostel. In February, the Aragonese crossed into Calabria to face off with Charles of Salerno. However, tensions between the Aragonese and the Sicilians had begun to rise. Both men now hoped to turn the war to their advantage, and the judicial duel turned into a farce, the two kings arriving at different times, declaring a victory over their absent opponent, and departing. Now the war was to escalate: Pope Martin had excommunicated Peter and proclaimed the war against the Sicilians a Crusade in January, and in March, declared Peter to be deprived of his dominions. On February 2, 1284, Aragon and Valencia were officially conferred upon Charles of Valois. The war continued in Italy: while little progress had been made in Calabria, a detachment of the Aragonese fleet was blockading Malta. Charles of Salerno sent a newly raised Provençal fleet to the relief of Malta; but it was caught by the main Aragonese fleet under Roger of Lauria and destroyed in the Battle of Malta. The Aragonese were now, however, running quite short of money, and Peter was threatened by the prospect of a French attack on Aragon. King Charles planned to raise new troops and a fleet in Provence, and instructed Charles of Salerno to maintain a strict defensive posture until his return from France. However, Roger of Lauria continued to command the sea and launch harrasing raids up and down the coast of Calabria, and in May 1284 he successfully blockaded Naples, basing a small squadron on the island of Nisida to do so. The Neapolitans were infuriated by the blockade; and in June, Charles of Salerno armed the newly launched fleet at Naples and embarked on June 5 to destroy the blockading squadron. Evidently believing the main Aragonese fleet was raiding down the coast, he hoped to destroy the blockading squadron and return to Naples before it returned. However, Roger of Lauria had learned of his plans, and Charles found himself engulfed by superior numbers. After a short, sharp, fight, most of his fleet was captured, and he himself was taken prisoner.<br />
 <br />
News of the reverse caused anti-French riots in Naples, and Roger of Lauria was quick to take advantage of Charles' captivity to obtain the release of Beatrice, daughter of Manfred of Sicily, then held in Naples. King Charles arrived in Gaeta on June 6 and learned of the disaster. He was furious at his son and his disobedience; by the time he reached Naples, the riots had been quelled. He advanced on Calabria and attempted a landing in Sicily; but his main army was blocked at Reggio, and he retreated from Calabria entirely on August 3. He continued to make preparations for a campaign against Sicily in the new year; but his health failed. On January 7, 1285, he died in Foggia.<br />
 <br />
Death and legacy<br />
On his death, Charles left all of his domains to his son Charles, then a prisoner in Catalonia. For the time being, they were held by a joint regency between a papal legate and Robert II of Artois. Charles had spent his life striving to assemble a Mediterranean empire out of whatever land he could get through law or force of arms. He did so, it seems, with a clear conscience; he regarded himself as God's instrument to uphold the Papacy and punish the Hohenstaufen. He ruled justly, but with the rigidity and severity that might be expected in one of his convictions. Ultimately, his unbending austerity could not inspire the devotion needed to hold his conquests together.<br />
 <br />
Still, he was to leave a substantial legacy to his heirs. Henry II of Cyprus reclaimed the Kingdom of Jerusalem after his death, for the few short years left to it; but his possessions otherwise remained within the Angevin dynasty which he founded, or their descendants. Both the Angevins and their Aragonese rivals were to claim the title of "King of Sicily"; but the Angevins, confined to the mainland, would be known to history as "Kings of Naples". But the style of "King of Sicily" persisted; and when the two realms were reunited, it was under the style of "King of the Two Sicilies".<br />
 <br />
However, his wars resulted in an even more serious consequence that the partition of the Kingdom of Sicily. Pope Martin IV had hopelessly compromised the Papacy in his cause; and the botched secular "Crusades" against Sicily and (after Charles' death) Aragon greatly tarnished its spiritual power. The collapse of its moral authority and the rise of nationalism rang the death knell for Crusading, and would ultimately lead to the Avignon Papacy and the Western Schism. Charles was an able soldier and a good administrator; but his failure to understand the qualities of his diverse subjects, and his grasping, if pious, ambition, ultimately led him to failure.<br />

Simon de Montfort is said to have first sought an asylum in England fromthe hostility of Blanche, Queen of France, and to have obtained arestitution of the Earldom of Leicester and stewardship of England fromKing Henry III through the petition of his brother, Almaric [Amaury],then Earl of Montfort and constable of France. Certain it is, however,that in 1232 (16th Henry III), he bore the title of Earl of Leicester andhad obtained a grant of all his mother's inheritance in England from hisbrother. In 1236, his lordship officiated as steward at the nuptials ofHenry III, and held the ewer in which the king washed. In two yearsafterwards, he obtained the hand of the king's sister, Eleanor, widow ofWilliam Marshal, Earl of Pembroke, the marriage ceremony being performedby Walter, one of the royal chaplains at Westminster, "within a littlechappel at the corner of the king's chamber." This marriage was, however,opposed by the princess's other brother, Richard, Earl of Cornwall(afterwards King of the Romans), and the kingdom at large, because thelady had made in her widowhood a vow of chastity in the presence ofEdmund, Archbishop of Canterbury and several of the nobility. So stronglydid public discontent manifest itself that the earl was obliged to repairin person to Rome for the purpose of obtaining a dispensation, which withconsiderable difficulty he at length accomplished; and returning toEngland was most graciously received at court by the king, who appointedhim his chief counsellor. Notwithstanding this, however, William deAbingdon, a Dominican friar, and many other of the clergy continued toexclaim against the marriage. But before the close of the same year, heexperienced the caprice of royal favour. The king observing him and hiscountess amongst the nobility who attended the queen at her purification,called him an excommunicated person and prohibited his entering thechurch. "Which sudden unkindness," says Dugdale, "much dismaying him, hewent away by water to Winchester House, which (the bishop being dead) theking had lent him. But there he could not be permitted to stay, the kingin great wrath causing him to be put out of doors. Whereupon he returnedsorrowing and weeping, yet could not appease his anger, the king plainlytelling him that he had abused his sister before marriage, and that,though he afterward gave her to him for a wife, it was unwillingly, andto avoid scandal. Upbraiding him that to ratify this, his unlawfulmarriage, he went to Rome and there corrupted that court with largebribes and promises, adding that, having failed in payment of the money,he ought justly be excommunicated." This storm ultimately drove hislordship from the kingdom, but only for a short period, as we find himreturning in 1240, and having then an honourable reception from the kingand all his court. Soon after this he made a journey to Jerusalem, havingpreviously disposed of one of his woods to the knights hospitallers andcanons of Leicester for somewhat less than £1000 to defray part of thenecessary expenses of the undertaking. Henceforward, he appears for aseries of years to have enjoyed the high favour of the king and to havefully merited it by his eminent services.<br />
 <br />
In the 32nd Henry III [1248], his lordship was appointed commander-in-chief of the forces in Gascony and in the end of that year he sat in the great convention of parliament held at London; about which time he obtained from the king a grant of the custody of Kenilworth Castle, for Eleanor, his wife, to hold during her life, and returning into Gascony, he forced Guaston de Bearne, who had raised the standard of rebellion, to an honourable truce. The earl came back to England the next year and was received at court with great honour. Soon after which, in fulfillment of a vow he had made as penance for his marriage, he began a journey to the Holy Land, and in the 34th of the same reign returned safely with his brother-in-law, Richard, Earl of Cornwall, and others. For the two following years he was actively and victoriously employed in Gascony until the king, hearkening to complaints against him for his cruelty and oppression, which appear to have been unsustainable, removed him from the seneschalship of that country.<br />
 <br />
Upon the subsequent insurrection of the barons against the king, the Earl of Leicester, siding with the former, was appointed their general-in-chief, in which character he fought the great battle of Lewes where the royal army sustained so signal a defeat the king himself being made prisoner with Prince Edward, his son, his brother, Richard, King of the Romans, and many other personages of eminence attached to his cause. This victory placing the government in the hands of the earl and his adherents, himself, the bishop of Chichester, the Earl of Gloucester, and a few others of less note were nominated to discharge the executive functions. One of the earliest acts of the usurpation was to summon a parliament in the king's name by writs dated 24 December, 49th Henry III [1265], directed to the bishops and abbots and to such lay lords as could be relied upon by which, signifying "the realm to be then in peace and quiet, and the desire of the king to establish the same to the honour of God, and benefit of his people," they were summoned to meet at London on the octaves of St. Hilary, there to sit in parliament, "to treat and give their advice." At the same time, precepts were issued to the sheriffs ordering them to return two knights for each county; to the cities and boroughs the like number of citizens and burgesses; and to the barons of the Cinque Ports, a certain number of their discreetest men for the same purpose. This is deemed the first precedent of a parliament, such as ever since has been established, and Sir William Dugdale thus speculates upon the causes of the revolution -- "If I may be so bold as to give my opinion, what reasons these potent rebels then had, thus to alter the former ancient usage, I shall take leave to conjecture that it was because they, discerning what large retinues the nobility and other great men in those elder times had , as also a great number of the king's tenants in capite, then called barones minores, it might have proved dangerous to themselves to permit such a multitude to come together."<br />
The new government did not, however, endure long, for a breach taking place between the two chiefs, Leicester and Gloucester, the arms of those powerful persons were directed against each other, and Prince Edward effecting his escape about the same time, the Earl of Gloucester reared the royal standard and formed a junction with the forces of the prince. With this army, marching towards Kenilworth, they surprised young Simon Montfort, the earl's son, and made prisoners of no less than thirteen of his chief adherents, almost without resistance. Elated with this triumph, they proceeded to Evesham, where the Earl of Leicester and his great force lay, expecting the arrival of his son whose banners the royal arms as a stratagem of war alone displayed and thereby completely deceived this able commander. His lordship undismayed, however, drew out his army in order of battle and, fighting gallantly to the last, fell in the midst of his enemies, when victory declared for the royal cause. It is said that, when the earl discerned the superiority and disposition of the royalist forces, he swore "by the arm of St. James (his usual exclamation), they have done discreetly, but this they learned from me; let us therefore commend our souls to God because our bodies are theirs." Nevertheless, encouraging his men, he told them, "it was for the laws of the land, yea, the cause of God and justice, that they were to fight." The principal persons slain in the memorable engagement were the Earl himself, Henry de Montfort, his eldest son, Hugh le Despenser, then justice of England, Ralph Basset, of Drayton, and about one hundred and sixty knights and many other gentlemen of his party. Amongst the prisoners were Guy de Montfort, a younger son of the earl; John Fitz-John, Humphrey de Bohun, the younger; John de Vesci, Peter de Montfort, junr., and Nicholas de Segrave. The body of the Earl was removed from the field of battle by some of his friends upon an old ladder covered with a poor torn cloth, and thus conveyed to the abbey of Evesham where, folded in a sheet, it was committed to the grave. But within a short time, some of the monks alleging that the earl, being an excommunicated person and attainted of treason, his remains were unworthy of Christian burial, the body was taken up and interred in a remote place known but to few. Thus fell, in 1264, Simon de Montfort, Earl of Leicester; one of the most eminent soldiers and statesmen of the period in which he lived and, under his attainder, the earldom became extinct. Of his widow, Eleanor, the king's sister, it is stated that, after the fatal battle of Evesham, she fled into France and took up her abode in the nunnery of the order of preachers, at Montarges, which had been founded by her husband's sister.<br />
 <br />
Of his issue:<br />
 <br />
Henry fell at Evesham, leading the van of the baronial army.<br />
 <br />
Simon, who for some time gallantly defended the castle of Kenilworth, was eventually made prisoner in the Isle of Ely by Prince Edward; afterwards effecting his escape, he fled into France and, in 1270, being at Viterbuirm, in Italy, he joined with his brother, Guy, in the murder of their cousin, Henry, eldest son of Richard, King of the Romans, in the church of St. Silvester, as the prince assisted at mass.<br />
 <br />
Guy fought in the van of the baronial army at Evesham, and being made prisoner, was confined in Dover Castle from which escaping, he fled into Tuscany and there, acquiring high reputation as a soldier, he obtained the dau. and heiress of the Earl Rufus for his wife. Meeting with Prince Henry, son of the King of the Romans, Guy and his brother, Simon slew him in revenge in the church of St. Silvester, at Viterbuirm, for which barbarous at, being first excommunicated by Pope Gregory X, he was thrown into prison but released in 1282 by Pope Martin II, and placed at the head of an army, in which situation he displayed his characteristic prowess. He subsequently, at the decease of his wife's father, returned to Tuscany and inherited a very considerable fortune. Charles I, King of Naples, made him Count de Nola. He d. in 1288, leaving by Margaret, his wife, dau. of Rodolph, Count de Languillara, on only dau., Anastasia de Montfort, Countess de Nola, m. to Raymond des Ursins.<br />

Simon de Montfort, Earl of Leicester (b. c. 1208, Montfort, Ile-de-France, Fr.--d. Aug. 4, 1265, Evesham, Worcestershire, Eng.), leader of the baronial revolt against King Henry III and ruler of England for less than a year.<br />
 <br />
Simon de Montfort, wholly French by birth and education, was the son of Simon de Montfort l'Amaury, leader of the crusade against the heretical Albigenses. On coming of age, he renounced to his eldest brother, Amaury, his claims on the family lands in return for the sole right to revive the Montfort claim to the English earldom of Leicester. This claim derived from his mother, Amicia, sister of Robert IV (died 1204), the last Beaumont earl of Leicester, whose lands had been divided between Amicia and her younger sister Margaret, countess of Winchester. King John had recognized Simon's father as earl (c. 1205) but had deprived him as a French subject (1207), and the Montfort claim had then lapsed.<br />
 <br />
Simon came to England in 1229 and, helped by his cousin Ranulf, earl of Chester, the tenant of the confiscated estates, obtained the honour of Leicester and did homage to Henry III in 1231, though he was not formally styled earl of Leicester until April 1239. He speedily became one of Henry's favourites, receiving an annual fee of 500 marks to compensate for the divided inheritance and exercising the hereditary stewardship at the coronation of Queen Eleanor (Eleanor of Provence; 1236). Henry arranged for his sister Eleanor to marry Simon on Jan. 7, 1238, thus breaking Eleanor's earlier vow of chastity and offending the English noblemen, who were not consulted. Henry's brother, Richard, earl of Cornwall, led an angry baronial protest, and Henry, alarmed, turned against Simon and Eleanor, driving them from England (August 1239). Simon went on crusade (1240-42) with Richard, with whom he was now reconciled, and won great prestige among the lords of the Latin Kingdom of Jerusalem, who asked their absentee king, the emperor Frederick II, to appoint Simon as his viceroy there. Returning to England, Simon joined Henry's disastrous invasion of France (1242), winning distinction by covering Henry's escape after his defeat at Saintes. Reconciled with Henry, and accepting an unfavourable settlement of Countess Eleanor's dower claims, Simon now made Kenilworth Castle (a royal grant) his headquarters. He cultivated the friendship of the radical reformer Robert Grosseteste, bishop of Lincoln, and took Robert's friend, the Oxford Franciscan Adam de Marisco, as spiritual director. Although regarded as a king's man, Simon was one of the committee of 12 appointed to handle the acute crisis of 1244 between Henry and his angry barons. He also took part in many important embassies to the French, papal, and imperial courts, and as a result he won many influential friends.<br />
 <br />
In 1248 Henry asked Simon to pacify the English-held Duchy of Gascony, in southwestern France. Simon, eager to join Louis IX's crusade, accepted reluctantly, stipulating for full powers as regent for seven years, without fear of recall and with full refund of expenses incurred. Treating the Gascon nobles as faithless rebels outside the law, he ruthlessly crushed the revolt and restored order; the Gascons appealed to Henry, accusing Simon of illegal procedure and oppression and threatening to renew their revolt. The matter was complicated by Simon's personal contest with Gaston de Béarn, the leading rebel. Henry, frightened, recalled Simon for trial on the rebels' charges; the English magnates acquitted him (1252), and he returned to Gascony to suppress the renewed revolt, but Henry now terminated his lieutenancy. Simon, accepting a partial financial settlement, withdrew to France, though Henry had to implore his help in his own campaign against the rebels in 1253. Such was Simon's international reputation that when Louis IX's mother, Blanche of Castile, died (November 1252) while Louis was still on crusade, the French magnates invited Simon to succeed her as regent.<br />
 <br />
Henry's behaviour over Gascony, though not wholly unjustified, convinced Simon that Henry was unfit to rule, and the King's disastrous undertaking, at Pope Innocent IV's behest, to conquer Sicily for his son Edmund, strengthened this conviction. Discussions with Grosseteste, Marisco, and other Franciscan intellectuals had fired Simon's mind with visions of a new order in both church and state, and he joined the other leading English barons in forcing upon Henry the revolutionary Provisions of Oxford (June 1258). The reformers began well, but by October 1259 divisions appeared between the conservative wing, led by Richard de Clare, earl of Gloucester, that sought only to limit abuses of royal power, and the radical element, led by Simon, that sought to bind the entire baronage to observe the reforms forced upon the King and his officers. Simon exacerbated the quarrel by his arrogant vehemence and put himself in the wrong by attempting to use Henry's subordination to secure settlement of his own and his wife's justifiable personal claims on Henry. Henry, allying with the Gloucester faction, shattered baronial unity early in 1260, and Simon emerged leading the extremist defenders of the reforms. By October 1261 Henry had isolated Simon, who went abroad; but the King's annulment of the Provisions, after he had received papal absolution from his oath to observe them, revived general disaffection (1262), and Simon returned (April 1263) to lead a rebellion that restored the Provisions (July 1263). But baronial unity had vanished, and, despite passionate support from the lesser barons, the county knights, the men of London and the Cinque Ports, and many clergy, Simon was forced to accept arbitration by Louis IX (December 1263). By the Mise of Amiens (January 1264) Louis totally annulled the Provisions and all consequent reforms: Simon rejected the award and after unsuccessfully attempting direct negotiations, defeated Henry at Lewes (May 14, 1264), capturing Henry and his son, the lord Edward.<br />
 <br />
Simon then governed England by military dictatorship, striving unsuccessfully for a legal basis of consent, both by negotiations with Henry's supporters and by calling representatives of both shires and boroughs to Parliament (1265) to counterbalance his lack of baronial support. But his monopolization of power alienated his chief ally, the young Gilbert de Clare, earl of Gloucester, who joined the royalist Marcher lords and secured Lord Edward's escape at Hereford (May 1265). By rapid and skillful maneuvering, Edward isolated Simon behind the Severn, destroyed at Kenilworth (August 1) the large army coming to his rescue, and trapped Simon's little force at Evesham (Aug. 4, 1265), slaying Simon and most of his followers.<br />
 <br />
The most outstanding English personality of his day, Simon is remembered as an early advocate of a limited monarchy, ruling through elected councillors and responsible officials, and of parliaments including county knights and burgesses as well as the great nobles.

 <br />
Simon de Montfort, 6th Earl of Leicester (1208 - August 4, 1265) was the principal leader of the baronial opposition to king Henry III of England.<br />
 <br />
He was the youngest son of Simon de Montfort, a French nobleman, and Alix of Montmorency. His paternal grandmother was Amicia de Beaumont, the senior co-heiress to the Earldom of Leicester and a large estate in England, but King John of England did not allow anyone who already held property in France to take ownership of such an estate in England.<br />
 <br />
As a boy, Simon accompanied his parents during his father's campaigns against the Cathars. He was with his mother at the siege of Toulouse in 1218, where his father was killed after being struck on the head by a stone pitched by a mangonel. On the death of their father, Simon's elder brother Amaury succeeded him. Another brother, Guy, was killed at the siege of Castelnaudary in 1220. As a young man, Simon probably took part in the Albigensian Crusades of the early 1220s.<br />
 <br />
In 1229 the two surviving brothers (Amaury and Simon) came to an arrangement whereby Simon gave up his rights in France and Amaury in turn gave up his rights in England. Thus freed from any allegiance to the king of France, Simon successfully petitioned for the English inheritance, which he received the next year, although he did not take full possession for several more years, and was not yet formally recognized as earl.<br />
 <br />
Meanwhile in January 1238 he secretly married Eleanor of England, daughter of King John of England and Isabella of Angouleme, sister of King Henry III of England. Eleanor had previously been married to William Marshal, 2nd Earl of Pembroke, and she had sworn a vow of chastity on his death, which she broke by marrying Simon. The archbishop of Canterbury, Edmund Rich, condemned the marriage for this reason. The English nobles protested the marriage of the king's sister to a foreigner of modest rank; most notably, Eleanor's brother Richard rose up in revolt when he learned of the marriage. King Henry eventually bought off Richard with 6,000 marks and peace was restored.<br />
 <br />
Relations between King Henry and Simon were cordial at first. Henry lent him his support when Simon embarked for Rome in March 1238 to seek papal approval for his marriage. When Simon and Eleanor's first son was born in November 1238 (despite rumors, more than nine months after the wedding night), he was baptized Henry in honor of his royal uncle. In February 1239 Simon was finally invested with the earldom of Leicester. He also acted as the king's counselor and was one of the godfathers of Henry's son, Edward.<br />
 <br />
Shortly after Prince Edward's birth, however, there was a falling out. Simon owed a great sum of money to Thomas II of Savoy, the uncle of Henry's queen, and named Henry as security for his repayment. King Henry had evidently not been told of this, and when he discovered that Simon had used his name, he was enraged. On August 9, 1239 Henry confronted Simon, called him an excommunicate and threatened to imprison him in the Tower of London. "You seduced my sister," King Henry said, "and when I discovered this, I gave her to you, against my will, to avoid scandal." Simon and Eleanor fled to France to escape the king's wrath. Having announced his intention to go on Crusade two years previously, Simon raised funds and finally set out for the Holy Land in summer 1240, leaving Eleanor in Brindisi, Italy. His force followed behind the much larger army led by his brother, Amaury. Also at the same time Simon's brother-in-law Richard took the cross, but their armies traveled separately. He arrived in Jerusalem by June 1241, when the citizens asked him to be their governor, but does not seem to have ever faced combat in the Holy Land. That autumn he left Syria and joined King Henry's campaign in Poitou. The campaign was a failure, and an exasperated Simon declared that Henry ought to be locked up like Charles the Simple.<br />
 <br />
Like his father, Simon was a hardened and ruthless soldier, as well as a capable administrator. His dispute with the king largely came about due to the latter's determination to ignore the swelling discontent within the country, caused by a combination of factors which included famine and a sense among the English barons that the king was too ready to dispense favour to his Poitevin and Savoyard relatives. In 1258, at Oxford, in his moment of greatest fame, Simon played a key role in calling a parliament which ranks as the forerunner of the modern institution. The king's son, the future King Edward I of England at first sympathised with Simon's cause, but later the two became enemies, and the Provisions of Oxford, which the king had sworn to uphold, were broken at the behest of the Pope in 1261.<br />
 <br />
Civil war broke out, and Simon de Montfort's army met and defeated the royal forces at the Battle of Lewes on May 14, 1264. The rebels captured Prince Edward, and the subsequent treaty set up a model parliament to agree a constitution formulated by Simon, the first parliament at which both knights and burgesses were present, thereby substantially broadening representation to include new groups of society.<br />
 <br />
However, many of the barons who had initially supported him now started to feel that Montfort's reforms were going too far, and his many enemies turned his triumph into disaster. Prince Edward escaped, and Simon's ally, Thomas de Clare, abandoned him and took with him his garrison. Though boosted by Welsh infantry sent by Simon's ally Llywelyn the Last, Simon's forces were severely depleted. Prince Edward attacked the Montfort forces at Kenilworth, capturing more of Simon's allies. Simon himself had crossed the Severn with his army, intending to rendezvous with his son Simon the younger de Montfort. When he saw the army awaiting him at Evesham, Simon initially thought it was led by his son. But the army belonged to Prince Edward, flying the Montfort banners he had captured at Kenilworth, and so leading Simon into a trap.<br />
 <br />
Matthew Paris reports that the bishop of Lincoln, Robert Grosseteste, once said to Simon's eldest son, "My beloved child, both you and your father will meet your deaths on one day, and by one kind of death, but it will be in the name of justice and truth." When Simon de Montfort faced the army of his nephew Edward, and saw the skill with which it was organized, he declared, "By St. James' arm, they are approaching with wisdom, and they learned this method from me, not from themselves. Let us then commend our souls to God, for our bodie are theirs."<br />
 <br />
Edward Longshanks' forces defeated and killed Montfort during the Barons' War at the Battle of Evesham in 1265, his body being mutilated, eviscerated and the remains scattered. His head was awarded to Roger Mortimer, who took it home as a gift for his wife. The precedent he set in calling his parliament with broader representation lived on, however, and was one that Edward would come to follow himself as king.<br />
 <br />
Montfort's family were forced into exile in his native France. His daughter, Eleanor, later married Llywelyn the Last as Simon had planned. After his death Simon's lands and titles became forfeit to the crown. A few months later the crown re-granted them to Edmund Crouchback, the king's youngest son.<br />
 <br />
Montfort has given his name to various English institutions, such as De Montfort University and De Montfort Hall, both in Leicester.<br />
 <br />
A memorial to Simon de Montfort stands in the park in Evesham in a place believed to be near where the High Altar of Evesham Abbey was located and a Stone Cross in the nearby Churchyard, the Stone Cross being viewable from the park. The memorial states that it is constructed with stone brought from near his birthplace in France.<br />

King Stephen V of Hungary (Hungarian: V. István, Slovak: Štefan V) (1239 or 1240 - August 6, 1272), was the eldest son of Bela IV of Hungary, whom he succeeded in 1270.<br />
 <br />
As crown prince he had exhibited considerable ability, but also a disquieting restlessness and violence. In 1262 Stephen convinced his father Bela to give him twenty-nine counties as a reward of assistance in the war against Bohemia; hence Hungary was virtually divided into two kingdoms. He subsequently seized the southern banate of Macsó and defeated his father in the ensuing civil war. In 1268 he undertook an expedition against the Bulgarians, penetrating as far as Tirnova and styling himself as king of Bulgaria.<br />
 <br />
Stephen's father, attempting to bind the powerful but pagan Cumans tribe more closely to the dynasty, arranged for Stephen's marriage, as a youth (about 1255), to Elizabeth, the daughter of the Cuman chieftain (named Koteny or Kuthens). Though Elizabeth, in preparation for the marriage, had been baptized and remained a Christian, western Europe almost universally considered Stephen as a semi-pagan. This hostility was felt as Stephen declared himself that everyone was his enemy for his accession to the Hungarian throne.<br />
 <br />
To secure foreign support, he formed a double matrimonial alliance with the Angevins, chief partisans of the pope. The first of these was the marriage in 1270 of his daughter Maria to Charles II of Naples (they became grandparents of Charles I of Hungary). The second alliance was the marriage of Stephen's infant son Ladislaus to Charles II's sister Elisabeth.<br />
 <br />
Byzantine Emperor Andronicus II married Anna, another of Stephen's daughters. Serbian king Stefan Dragutin married Katerina, yet another of Stephan's daughters.<br />
 <br />
Adversaries of Stephen, especially Ottokar II of Bohemia, believed that Stephen was too great a friend of the mighty Cumans (who could field 16,000 men) to be a true Catholic. Ottakar endeavoured with the aid of the Hungarian malcontents to conquer the western provinces of Hungary but they were utterly routed by Stephen in 1271 near Mosony. Ottakar relinquished all his conquests the same year in the peace of Pressburg.<br />
 <br />
Stephen died suddenly as he was raising an army to rescue his kidnapped infant son Ladislaus from his rebellious vassals.<br />

Eleanor of England (also called Eleanor Plantagenet1 and Eleanor of Leicester) was born in the year 1215, in Gloucester. She was the youngest child of King John of England and Isabelle of Angouleme. John's London was conquered and Isabella was in shame. He had been forced to sign the Magna Carta. Eleanor would never see her Father, as he died at Newark Castle when she was barely a year old. The French, led by Philip II of France, were marching through the south. The only lands loyal to her brother were in the middle and southwest. The barons ruled the north, but they united with the royalists under William Marshal, 1st Earl of Pembroke, who protected the young king, and Philip was defeated.<br />
 <br />
William Marshal died in 1219 and Eleanor was promised to his son, also named William. They were married on April 23, 1224 at New Temple Church in London. The younger William was 34 and Eleanor only nine. He died in London on April 6, 1231, days before their 7th anniversary. There were no children of this marriage. The widowed Eleanor swore a holy oath of chastity in the presence of Edmund Rich, Archbishop of Canterbury.<br />
 <br />
Seven years later, she met Simon de Montfort, 6th Earl of Leicester. They fell in love and married secretly on January 7, 1238 at the King's chapel at Westminister Palace. Her brother King Henry later alleged that he only allowed the marriage because Simon had seduced Eleanor. The marriage was controversial because of the oath Eleanor had sworn several years before to remain chaste. Because of this, Simon made a pilgrimage to Rome seeking papal approval for their union. Simon and Eleanor would have six children:<br />
   1. Henry de Montfort (November 1238-1265)<br />
   2. Simon the younger de Montfort (April 1240-1271)<br />
   3. Amaury de Montfort, Canon of York (1242/1243-1300)<br />
   4. Guy de Montfort, Count of Nola (1244-1288)<br />
   5. A daughter, born and died in Bordeaux between 1248 and 1251.<br />
   6. Richard de Montfort (1252-1266)<br />
   7. Eleanor de Montfort (1258-1282)<br />
 <br />
Simon de Montfort had the real power behind the throne, but when he tried to take the throne, he was defeated with his son at the Battle of Evesham on August 4, 1265. Eleanor fled to exile in France where she became a nun at Montargis Abbey, a nunnery founded by her dead husband's sister Amicia. She died and was buried there on April 13, 1275.<br />

Fortun Garces the One-Eyed or the Monk (d. aft. 925) was the King of Pamplona reigning at least 882-905.<br />
 <br />
He was the eldest son of King Garcia Iniguez, himself the son of king Eneko Aritza. His mother may have been Urraca of Aragon.<br />
 <br />
Fortun may have had one or more kinsmen as co-kings during his reign: Garcia II Jimenez, Inigo II Garces, possibly Sancho I Garces, members of the Jimenez line of the Basque dynasty. Fortun was to be the last king of the Aritza line.<br />
 <br />
Prince Fortun was taken prisoner by the Moors in 860 in conjunction with the invasion of Emir Mohamed I of Cordoba and was kept the next 20 years imprisoned by the enemies.<br />
 <br />
His father died in 870, while Fortun was a prisoner in Cordoba. The kingdom was governed by the Regent, Garcia II of Pamplona.<br />
 <br />
Fortun was released in 880, and upon his return to Pamplona, was apparently recognized as king.<br />
 <br />
The regent and co-king Garcia II was killed at Ayhar in 882 in a battle against the Emir of Cordoba, and from this onwards, Fortun apparently was the sole or the chief king of Pamplona.<br />
 <br />
During his reign, the kingdom suffered from various military expeditions.<br />
 <br />
Lope ibn Muhammad was the head of Banu Qasi in that period.<br />
 <br />
An alliance of enemies of the Banu Qasi, the king Alfonso III of Asturias and count of Pailhars, brought about a coup. This probably took place in and after 905, although sources are sketchy and unclear.<br />
 <br />
After a reign of twenty-two years, Fortun decided to become a monk at Leyra, the oldest convent in Navarre, to which no less than seventy-two other convents were subject. He was the last monarch of the male line of Eneko Aritza.<br />
 <br />
His kinsman Sancho I of Pamplona (Sancho Garces, son of Garcia Jimenez the Regent, co-king) was the choice of the Navarrese to succeed him. Sancho I ascended in 905.<br />
 <br />
Fortun had several surviving children: sons Inigo, Aznar, Blasco and Lope, as well as a daughter, Oneca Fortunez, who in 847 married Abd Allah, Emir of Cordoba, and secondly her cousin Aznar Sanchez of Larraun, becoming the mother of the future queen Toda Aznarez, second wife of Sancho I of Pamplona.<br />

Jimeno Garces was chosen to succeed his kinsman Eneko Aritza as King ofPamplona in 851 or 852. He was apparently the son of Garcia Jimenez, whowas probably lord of Alava and possibly a Duke of Gascony/Vasconia duringthe time of King Inigo. His accession apparently united these two Basqueterritories. In 860, however, the united Pamplonese and Navarrese gavethe Crown to the son of Aritza, Garcia Iniguez. Jimeno's own son GarciaJimenez apparently became co-King of Pamplona sometime during the nextreign. In the 10th century, Jimeno's line completely displaced the lineof Aritza, and his male line reigned in Navarre until 1234.<br />

 <br />
Garcia Jimenez, Regent and co-king of Kingdom of Pamplona at least from 870, until his death in 882.<br />
 <br />
He was the son of Jimeno I of Pamplona (lord Ximeno Garces), lord of Alava, who held the kingdom up to 860. It seems possible that their branch of the Basque dynasty (as they had brought their own territories to the Pamplonan realm) was entitled to position of sort of co-king, thus Garcia II may have been a co-regent already in the lifetime of Garcia I.<br />
 <br />
When his kinsman king Garcia I of Pamplona died in 870 and Prince Fortun Garces, the heir of the deceased, was imprisoned in Cordoba, Garcia Jimenez became uncontested Regent of the kingdom and was treated as chief king.<br />
 <br />
Garcia II Jimenez zealously defended his country against the encroachments of Islam, but was killed at Ayhar (882) in a battle against the Emir of Cordova.<br />
 <br />
Garcia's kinsman Fortun Garcez had been released from captivity in 880 and returned to be king. Probably they were co-kings, and Fortun became the chief king or the sole king only at the death of his kinsman Garcia II.<br />
 <br />
After the coup against Fortun in 905, Jimeno Garces' line totally took over the kingship.<br />
 <br />
Garcia Jimenez was co-king as Garcia II of Pamplona. His sons were kings or co-kings Inigo II, Sancho I and Jimeno II. The eldest of these was Inigo II Garcez and the second was Sancho I of Pamplona who became sole king in 905.<br />
