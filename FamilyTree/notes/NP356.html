<p>
<a name ="I033804"><b>[I033804]</b></a><br />
Mary Janice "Jan" McCarthy fought a long battle with cancer. But that did not keep her from going to see her son Brendan run his first marathon. He raised more than $2,500 in pledges on behalf of the American Cancer Society when he ran in the 1993 Revco-Cleveland Marathon. <br>
"I thought what he was doing was really neat. It's even more neat that he was doing it for me," she said from her bed in a van. <br>
Mrs. McCarthy, 54, of Rocky River, died Wednesday at her home. <br>
She was a member of St. Christopher Catholic Church. Over the 12-year course of her illness, Mrs. McCarthy, a devout Catholic, made friends through frequent at-home Masses. <br>
People who attended the Masses said they came not so much to comfort Mrs. McCarthy, but for what they learned from her courage, humor and acceptance of her situation. <br>
Mrs. McCarthy was born in Bradford, Pa., and graduated from Villa Maria College in Erie, Pa. <br>
She was a substitute teacher in Lakewood and Rocky River schools, and a real estate agent for HGM Hilltop Realty. She also was a real estate investor. <br>
Mrs. McCarthy is survived by her husband, Terrance B.; daughters Colleen S. of Raleigh, N.C., and Megan A. of Rocky River; sons Brendan T. of Denver, and Daniel M. of Orlando, Fla.; mother Dorothea McCoy of Bradford, Pa.; two sisters; and two brothers. <br>
Services will be at 9:30 a.m. today at St. Christopher Catholic Church, 20141 Detroit Rd., Rocky River. McGorray Bros. Funeral Home in Lakewood is handling arrangements. <br>
