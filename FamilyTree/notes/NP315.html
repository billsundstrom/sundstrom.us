<h2>Notes</h2>
Shirley Ann LARSON
<p>
<a name ="I039559"><b>[I039559]</b></a><br />
Shirley was born at 1:47am at Saint Barnahas Hospital, Minneapolis, Minnesota. She graduated from Faribault High School in 1948. Shirley and Dave were classmates in high school. They started dating in college and were married when they were juniors. She married just prior to her 21st birthday. When Shirley was a freshman in college she became ill and went to the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota. She was operated on for a mass in her chest. The doctors believed that she was a twin at conception and the mass was from the other embryo. She returned to Faribault to recover and missed half of the school year. And yet, she graduated on time, in only 3 1/2 years. On 2 June 1952, she graduated from Hamline University in St. Paul, Minnesota with a Bachelor of Arts, major English, magna cum laude. She taught high school English at Dodge Center, Minnesota for 2 years after she graduated from college. Dave went to Air Force basic training and then on to administrative technical school, while Shirley was teaching. She enjoyed dancing and the card game "bridge". She enjoyed participating in the Officer's Wives Club and oversees life. During their assignments to Japan and Germany, she traveled extensively. Dave says she really enjoyed the military and was "the perfect officer's wife". She died just prior to Dave being promoted to full colonel. Unfortunately, she never knew it, because it would have met so much to her. She was diagnosed with breast cancer at Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio in 1966. After a mastectomy, doctors gave her 5 years to live. She lived 7 years after the diagnosis. During their assignment in Germany, Air Force doctors asked her to go to Wilford Hall, Texas for experimental surgery to remove her pituitary gland. The surgery did not stop the cancer from spreading. On 28 Aug 1973 she went into the Kirtland Air Force Base, New Mexico hospital and started to fail very quickly.<br>

Theodore I LASCARIS
<p>
<a name ="I008422"><b>[I008422]</b></a><br />
Theodore Lascaris (d. 1222), emperor of Nicaea, was born of a noble Byzantine family.<br>
<br>
He became the son-in-law of the Byzantine Emperor Alexius III and distinguished himself during the sieges of Constantinople by the Latins (1203-1204). After the capture of the city he gathered a band of fugitives in Bithynia and established himself in the town of Nicaea, which became the chief rallying-point for his countrymen.<br>
<br>
Relieved of the danger of invasion by a Latin force which had defeated him in 1204 but was recalled to Europe by a Bulgarian invasion, he set to work to form a new Byzantine state in Asia Minor, and in 1206 assumed the title of emperor.<br>
<br>
During the next years Theodore was beset by enemies surrounding his fledgling state. He maintained himself stubbornly in defensive campaigns against the Latin emperor Henry of Flanders, defeated his rival Alexius I, emperor of Trebizond, and carried out a successful counter-attack upon Kay Khusrau I, the sultan of RÃ¼m (also called the sultan of Iconium or Konya), who had been instigated to war by the deposed Alexius III.<br>
<br>
Theodore's crowning victory was gained in 1210, when in a battle near Pisidian Antioch he captured Alexius and wrested the town itself from the Turks.<br>
<br>
At the end of his reign he ruled over a territory roughly conterminous with the old Roman provinces of Asia and Bithynia. Though there is no proof of higher qualities of statesmanship in him, by his courage and military skill he enabled the Byzantine nation not merely to survive, but ultimately to beat back the Latin invasion.<br>
<br>
Family<br>
By his first wife, Anna Komnena Angelina, the daughter of the Emperor Alexius III, Theodore Lascaris had two daughters: Eirene Laskarina (married John III Ducas Vatatzes) and Maria Laskarina (married King Bela IV of Hungary).<br>
<br>
After Anna Angelina died in 1212, Theodore Lascaris remarried to Philippa of Armenia, the daughter of King Ruben III of Armenia. This marriage was annuled a year later, and the son born to them, Constantine, was disinherited.<br>
<br>
Theodore Lascaris married thirdly Marie de Courtney, the daughter of Peter of Courtenay and Yolanda of Flanders, but they had no children.<br>
