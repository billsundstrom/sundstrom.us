Staff Sergeant Juan Ridout : Soldier lives on in memories Loved ones recall Air Force sergeant killed in Philippines<br>
The one constant in Jessica Ridout 's life, while moving as a child of a Navy man from Corpus Christi, to Washington, to Guam and Hawaii, was her brother, Juan . <br>
Air Force Staff Sergeant Juan Ridout , who was one of 10 people killed in the crash of a U.S. military helicopter in the Philippines on Feb. 22, was honored in 1999 for heroism in rescuing a downed pilot. <br>
"Everything changed when we moved all over, except his face," the 28-year-old said. "Now it's so hard to think about life without him because it's been so fun with him." <br>
On February 22, the Air Force staff sergeant was in a MH-47 Chinook special operations helicopter when it crashed off the coast of the Philippines. The crash killed nine other men. Ridout 's family is scattered around the country and Jessica lives in Dallas. Her brother will be buried here, where he was born and where his mother is buried. <br>
Lt. Col. Stephen Barger, public affairs officer for Pacific Command in Hawaii, said that the helicopter carried men who were in the Philippines to "train, advise and assist the armed forces in the Philippines to develop their own capability in combating terrorism." <br>
And Juan Ridout was proud to be part of the mission and to serve as a pararescueman. <br>
"I think he is a brave man for doing what he did," said Stacee Fejer, his girlfriend of four years, who is on active duty with the Air Force, stationed in Japan. "I loved seeing him happy and he was happy doing what he was doing." <br>
A pararescueman is dropped into a sometimes hostile area to rescue and recover an injured soldier. Specializing in Air Force and Special Operations Combat Search and Rescue/Personnel Recovery, pararescuemen also provide specialized aerospace rescue and recovery support for NASA's Space Shuttle flights, according to the U.S. Air Force. Pararescuemen are certified scuba divers, trained combat medics and certified emergency medical technician paramedics. <br>
An opportunity to help:<br>
The job suited Ridout for two reasons. First, he loved extreme sports and was an avid weightlifter. Second, he felt that his Air Force job gave him the opportunity to help others. <br>
"One day, he said to me, 'I got a trophy' and I said, 'That's so cool, Juan . What for?" Jessica Ridout remembers. "He just told me 'Just for some things we were doing.' " <br>
The trophy he had won was for his heroism in saving a downed pilot in Serbia. He was selected as the 1999 pararescueman of the year. <br>
His humility caused his sister to make sure she could make him blush at every turn. She'd start asking him for Christmas gift requests early, knowing from the past that he would take his time. <br>
"He never wanted to ask anyone for anything," his sister said, laughing "so I made sure we sent him the biggest box with the most presents." <br>
He was quick to give it back. When it came time to send postcards, he'd be sure to pick something with a picture of Elvis, for instance, and would plaster his face on the card. He left goofy messages on his family's answering machines, and was addicted to cartoons. On his first date with Stacee, they saw the movie "Anastasia." <br>
"He would watch cartoons like Digimon, and play computer games," she said. <br>
Although he joked, he was sensitive to others' moods. "He never really liked to see someone upset," Jessica said. "If he had a worry it was for someone else." <br>
Stacee's last conversation with Ridout was two days before the crash. <br>
"It was a great talk to him and he loved hearing about my day," she said. "He couldn't really tell me about his, so I just talked." <br>
Jessica also didn't know too much about her brother's mission in the Philippines. <br>
"I was better off not knowing because I would have worried," she said. "Just every time I talked to him, I would tell him, 'Call me when you get home. Be safe.'" <br>
Services and donations:<br>
A rosary will be recited at 6 p.m. today at the chapel of Memory Gardens Funeral Home. <br>
Funeral services will be at 9 a.m. Saturday at Ss. Cyril and Methodius Catholic Church, with the burial to follow at Memory Gardens Cemetery. <br>

<p>
<a name ="I099470"><b>[I099470]</b></a><br />
Gary V. Rieger, 71, of Reno, NV, formerly of Esmond, ND, died Wednesday, January 22, 2014 in Reno. Mass of Christian Burial will be said on June 21st, 2014, 10:00 AM St. Boniface Catholic Church in Esmond.<br>
Gary (Gerald) V. Rieger, 71, of Reno, Nevada passed away Wednesday, January 22, at Renown South Meadows Medical Center in Reno, with his family by his side.<br>
Gary was born to Vincent and May (Johnson) Rieger on November 14, 1942 in Rugby, ND. He was raised on the family farm near Esmond, ND. Gary began his education in a country school in Pierce County along with all of the children from neighboring farms. He graduated from Esmond High School in 1960. Gary attended Mayville State College and later transferred to Minot College of Business. He enlisted and served with the North Dakota National Guard.<br>
Gary married Jane Batke and from this union came two sons, Troy and Curtis. They made their home in Minot. Gary worked in accounting, insurance and sales throughout his career. He also farmed with his father for a few years. He later married Cyndi Brown. After taking some time to travel around the US and experience the country, he moved to Reno, NV, where he has lived for over 25 years. As Gary would say, for the past twelve years he has enjoyed being a "gofer" for his sons and their business and "gofer Grandpa" for his grandchildren.<br>
Gary's greatest joy was spending time with his sons and grandchildren. He often talked about their excursions into the Sierra Mountains where they would camp, fish and hike; road trips they would make; and the regular gatherings of family and friends at his sons' homes. Every summer, Gary would travel back to North Dakota to the family farm and spend several months with his siblings. They would choose a fix-up project each summer, which turned out to be more fun than work. Mornings at the farm started out with coffee on the veranda and discussions that ranged from serious to silly, but most often it was reminiscing and laughter. These are times that will forever be cherished.<br>
His fun loving nature and great sense of humor made Gary a joy to be around. When his mother was in the nursing home in Harvey, ND, Gary moved back to the farm and stayed the duration. He made daily trips to visit her. His humor, patience and caring nature not only resonated with his mother, but also with the other residents who also looked forward to his visits. He will be missed by many, young and old.<br>
Gary is survived by his sons, Troy and Curtis, both of Reno, NV; Grandchildren: Michael Rieger, Eric Rieger and Amber Rieger; One brother: Roger (Diane) Rieger of St. Cloud, MN; Three sisters: Bonnie Alexander of Esmond, ND; Yvonne (Brad) Westrum of Grand Forks, ND; Cindy Wilhelm of Minot, ND; and many nephews and nieces.<br>
He was preceded in death by his parents, an infant brother and a niece, Andrea Rieger Hodge.<br>
Celebration of Life Service will held in Reno for friends and family.<br>
Mass of Christian Burial will be Saturday, June 21 at 11:00 a.m. at St. Boniface Catholic Church in Esmond, ND with Fr. Brian Bachmeier, celebrant.<br>
Burial will follow in the church cemetery.<br>

<a name ="I112896"><b>[I112896]</b></a><br />
Lillian M. Ries Sill (Novak, Ginn)<br>
One beautiful autumn day the leaves were falling, a calm and peaceful time. The Angels came to take our mother, Lillie, home to be with our dad, Cliff, on their wedding anniversary date. The chain seems broken now, but one by one the links will make it whole again.<br>
Lillian was born in Anselmo, Neb., on Jan. 26, 1922, to George and Nellie Tappan. At the age of 5 she was adopted by Bertrand and Martha Ries, of Grand Island, Neb. She was raised on their farm along with her adoptive brother, Glen Ries.<br>
In 1940, she was married in Tacoma, Wash., to Henri Novak, of Austria. To that union she had two children, Virginia and Robert Glen Novak. On Nov. 19, 1945, she was remarried to Clifford W. Sill, of Joplin. Together they had four children and raised six children as one family. Her beloved Cliff was deceased on Nov. 15, 1963. She subsequently was married briefly to Harry Ginn, deceased.<br>
She was preceded in death by a good family friend, John Gammon. Lillian was a wonderful lady, a devoted and impartial mother. Her family meant everything to her. Her family reunion was a highlight she looked forward to every September. What once was only she and her children and their spouses, soon grew to a very large family gathering, that friends were always welcome to attend. And she had many friends. She had such charm when she smiled. She loved music, dancing, planting flowers, chocolate, Mexican food, the lake, fishing, pretty jewelry and poetry. She wrote poetry and had many poems published in national magazines and newspapers. She loved her home, her front porch where in later years she spent many hours watching the squirrels and birds in her yard. She loved to cook and was very creative in the kitchen, but most of all she loved her little dog, Annie Mae.<br>
Lillian taught her children well. The girls to be ladies, the boys to be gentleman and to respect their elders and call them by their last names, rather than the first. She taught us about God and faith. She taught us to love one another and to be honest and responsible adults. She taught us a good work ethic. The people we are today, is due to the lessons she and our dad, Cliff, taught us. She was a member of the McKinley Avenue Baptist Church and the VFW Auxiliary, Sunday school teacher, MYF Leader at Chitwood Methodist Church.<br>
She is survived by her brother, Glen Ries and his wife, Joann, of Omaha, Neb.; her six children: three daughters, Virginia Novak Sill Vangel and her husband, James, Joplin, Marjorie Sill Chaddock, Hurst, Texas and Marylina Sill Green and husband, Aaron, Webb City; three sons, Robert Glen Novak, Joplin, David C. Sill and wife, Joyce, Webb City and Daniel J. Sill, Fort Worth, Texas; sister-in-law, Susan Daubin Sill Melton, of Fort Worth; 17 grandchildren; 32 great-grandchildren; and three great-great-grandchildren.<br>
We, her children were afforded the HONOR and PRIVILEGE of caring for our dear mom in her home of many years, where she and dad raised the family. We were given the gift of being with her when she needed us most and when she departed to her Heavenly Home. We were able to see a glimpse of the sweet, trusting little girl she had once been and that blessing will always be with us.<br>
The family wishes to thank Mom's care givers, Freddie and Vicki, of Integrity Healthcare; Ruth and Ann, of Oxford Healthcare; and the entire staff of National Healthcare and Trinity Hospice. McKinley Avenue Baptist Church, Ruth Lowery, Rev. Jarel Burnside, Dr. Kimberly Wood for her many years of care and Dr. O.A. Mehaffey, our dear friends, Marilyn Spidle, Marie Mock-Butterfield, granddaughter and very special daughter-in-law, Susan Daubin Sill Melton, whose devoted compassionate care of our mom was a blessing. We also wish to thank Geneva and Otis Beaver, her long time neighbors and friends who participated in moms welfare and care.<br>
Funeral services will be 11 a.m. Wednesday at Mason-Woodard Chapel. Rev. Jarel Burnside, officiating. Pallbearers will be grandsons, Keith Sill, Eric Sill, Clifford Sill, Jamie Vangel, Cary Chaddock, Robert Glen Novak II and Michael Green. Burial will be in Ozark Memorial Park Cemetery. The family will receive friends from 7 to 8 p.m. Tuesday at the mortuary.<br>
