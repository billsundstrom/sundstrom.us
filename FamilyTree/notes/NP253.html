Adelaide of HOLLAND
<p>
<a name ="I008348"><b>[I008348]</b></a><br />
Adelaide of Holland (circa 1222 - 1284) was a daughter of Floris IV, Count of Holland and sister of William II, Count of Holland and King of Germany. In 1246, Adelaide married John I of Avesnes, Count of Hainaut.<br>
<br>
Between 1258 and 1263, Adelaide was regent of Holland in the name of her nephew Floris V. She died in 1284, but in 1299, with the death of Floris' son John I, it was her own son John II of Avesnes who inherited Holland through her.<br>
</p>
Floris III of HOLLAND
<p>
<a name ="I008371"><b>[I008371]</b></a><br />
From Wikipedia,<br>
Count Floris III of Holland ( 1141 - August 1, 1190) was Count of Holland from 1157 to his death, succeeding his father, Dirk VI.<br>
<br>
On September 28, 1162 he married Ada, sister of king William I of Scotland, also known as William the Lion. The county of Holland adopted from him the rampant lion in the coat of arms and the name of William.<br>
<br>
Floris III was a loyal vassal to Frederick I Barbarossa. He accompanied the emperor on two expeditions to Italy in 1158 and 1176-1178.<br>
<br>
The emperor gave Floris the toll right of Geervliet, the most important toll station in Holland at that time. This was actually the legalisation of an existing situation, because the counts of Holland had charged tolls illegally since the start of the 11th century.<br>
<br>
During his reign Floris III had troubles with West-Friesland and a war with Philip count of Flanders concerning their respective rights in West Zeeland, in which he was beaten. In 1170 a great flood caused immense devastation in the north and helped to form the Zuider Zee.<br>
<br>
In 1189 Floris accompanied Frederick Barbarossa upon the third Crusade, of which he was a distinguished leader. He died in 1190 at Antioch of pestilence and was buried there.<br>
<br>
Two sons of Floris III became count of Holland: Dirk VII in 1190 and William I in 1203.<br>

<a name ="I111670"><b>[I111670]</b></a><br />
Born Terry Lynn Holsten to John Edward Holsten and Ruth Louise Sullens in Inglewood CA on September 3rd, 1952. She was the second born daughter and a year younger than sister Susan. Her parents divorced when she was very young and Edward was not involved in their raising. They were sent to their grandparentʼs home in Cambria around 1960 for their mom to recover and find a new husband. They both loved being there and made friends who were sad to see them leave but they did come up every summer for the next 5 years after. They did fun stuff like swing in trees with fastened ropes and make outdoor forts from old sheets where they could play and picnic along with running on the trails in the woods. Their grandpa was a guard at Hearst Castle and back then they were allowed to barbecue and swim in the pool after hourʼs which she loved to brag about. Terry was the cool friend from the city with great clothes who taught the latest dance moves and how to dress and style hair. She and Sue were both tall, long legged and beautiful. Terry was also very light hearted, vivacious and a bit mischievous. Ruth, Terryʼs mom did remarry to a wonderful man Robert Moe who became Terry and Sueʼs beloved step-father. Together they had her half-sister Linda. Terry attended Inglewood High School and was in the band. She graduated in 1970 and went on to college. She later worked at a bank where she met her first husband Ralph Olson, 14 years her senior. Shortly after, they moved to Ceres and started their real estate careers even having their own company, Venture Properties.They loved entertaining with friends and Terry had dreams of being a singer. In 1988, she found the daughter Stacy who she gave up for adoption at age 15 and was able to have a loving relationship with her and her grandson Jesse who was born in 1997. Sadly Ralph passed away in 2000. Her sister Susan passed away in 2008. Terry married a second time shortly after to David Van Wettering and moved to Stockton. David passed away in 2013. Terry moved back to her home in Ceres where she spent her remaining years. <br>
Terry is preceded in death by first husband Ralph Olson, sister Susan Mesecher, step father Robert Moe and second husband, David Van Wettering. She is survived by daughter Stacy Charlton, grandson Jesse Charlton, mom Ruth Moe and half-sister Linda Moe.<br>
Terry wanted to be remembered as an angel of God who was put on Earth to make people happy and that she did. Rest in peace sweet angel! Your spirit will be missed but not forgotten.<br>
