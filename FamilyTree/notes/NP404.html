<p>
<a name ="I021800"><b>[I021800]</b></a><br />
Wilmot Trinity Anglican church records, indicate Rebecca was born October 8, 1807; Aylesford Township records indicate she was born October 5, 1807. According to her headstone she was born October 6, 1806. - Paul Saunders<br>
According to the family tree drawn from memory by the elderly Frank G. Hutchinson for me around 1960, this Francis Hutchinson was married to "Hannah Ogilvie." Other sources on the Internet suggest strongly that Hannah [Eagles] Ogilvie was actually Francis' mother, and this appears to be most likely. --Robert B. Nichol, 2006<br>

Halfdan OLAFSSON
<p>
<a name ="I008112"><b>[I008112]</b></a><br />
From Wikipedia<br>
<br>
Halfdan Hvitbeinn (Old Norse: Hálfdan hvı́tbeinn) was the son of Olof Trätälja of the House of Yngling according to Heimskringla. He lived around A.D. 710.<br>
<br>
His father was sacrificed to Odin by the Swedish settlers in Värmland because of a famine. Some Swedes, however, realised that the famine was brought by overpopulation and not by the fact that the king had been neglecting his religious duties.<br>
<br>
Consequently, they resolved to cross the Ed Forest and settle in Norway and happened to end up in Soleyar where they killed king Sölve and took Halfdan prisoner. The Swedish expatriates elected Halfdan king as he was the son of their old king, Olof. Halfdan subjugated all of Soleyar and took his army into Romerike and subjugated that province as well.<br>
<br>
Halfdan was to become a great king, who married Åsa, the daughter of king Eystein, the ruler of Oppland and Hedmark. They had two sons, Öystein Halfdansson and Gudröd.<br>
<br>
Halfdan conquered a large part of Hedemark, Toten, Hadeland and a part of Vestfold. When his brother Ingjald Olofsson died, he inherited Wermelandia. Halfdan died of old age in Toten and was transported to Vestfold where he was buried under a mound.<br>
</p>
Rognvald OLAFSSON
<p>
<a name ="I004830"><b>[I004830]</b></a><br />
Ragnvald the Mountain-High was a petty king of Westfold in what is today Norway. He was the son of Olaf Geirstad-Alf and the cousin of Harald Fairhair.<br>
<br>
His greatest contribution to posterity was that he asked the skald jóđólfr of Hvinir to compose a poem about his ancestry. This poem is known as Ynglingatal and is not only one of the oldest, but also one of the most famous and debated of the Old Norse poems.<br>
<br>
jóđólfr ended the poem with these lines:<br>
    Under the heaven's blue dome, a name<br>
    I never knew more true to fame<br>
    Than Rognvald bore; whose skilful hand<br>
    Could tame the scorners of the land, --<br>
    Rognvald, who knew so well to guide<br>
    The wild sea-horses through the tide:<br>
    The "Mountain-high" was the proud name<br>
    By which the king was known to fame.<br>
