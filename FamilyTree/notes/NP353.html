James Louis McCann was first buried in the National Cemetery in Santa Fe, New Mexico.  I checked with his daughter Mary Jo. Mary Jo said that when her mother moved back to Minnesota to be close to her children, they did move him to Fort Snelling National Cemetery.   Jim was taken prisoner in WWII and sent to Germany.  He worked repairing streets and removing debris from the bombings.  He was raised of course in St. Cloud and had a number of German neighbors and he learned how to speak some German.  While a prisoner he was able to trade some of the Red Cross things for bread from the German people living in the town.  This is how he and his fellow prisoners were able to keep from starving. <br>
