<h2>Notes</h2>
Archibald Adrian CAMPBELL
<p>
<a name ="I065375"><b>[I065375]</b></a><br />
During World War II, Archie A. Campbell was so eager to fly that he quit college and enlisted in the Royal Canadian Air Force. When the United States entered the war, he switched from flying Canadian fighters to piloting U.S. bombers. <br>
Campbell , a retired insurance agent with Northwestern Mutual Life Insurance, died Monday of cancer at his home in Minneapolis. He was 81. <br>
In 1957 the Minneapolis Star wrote that when Campbell undertook something, "he doesn't do it halfway. That goes for his business, his religion, flying or even hunting." <br>
Campbell was born in Grand Rapids, Minn., and joined Northwestern in 1945. He went to St. John's University in Collegeville, Minn. <br>
"My husband was a very modest man," said his wife, Mary Grace. "He never talked about what he did." <br>
During the war Campbell flew 33 missions for the U.S. Army Air Force and received the Air Medal. He started as a B-17 copilot. <br>
"Archie's phenomenal concentration and flying skills helped him fly in tight formation, which was crucial for safe flying through enemy territory," said his daughter Kati Kilcoyne of Long Lake. "His squadron leader recognized this and asked Archie to be his wing man." <br>
After the war, Campbell joined Northwestern Mutual and became one of its top producers in the nation He retired in the 1970s but had clients he continued to work with, his wife said. <br>
Archie Campbell led a fund-raising campaign for the Boy Scouts and served for many years as chairman of the regional United Way, said his daughter. He also was campaign chairman for the annual May family rosary procession in the 1960s, and was president of the St. John's University alumni association. <br>
"He did it with a will, and so he kept getting asked to do all these things," his wife said. "He was a diligent worker, and he always brightened the atmosphere with some funny quips." <br>
Campbell , an avid hunter and sportsman, was one of the first to take up water-skiing as a sport. And in the 1960s he bought a bus from Greyhound Lines and converted it into a traveling vehicle. For many years, he and his family traveled around the nation in it. He told the Minneapolis Tribune that "after the high initial outlay, expenses of traveling have been 'pretty cheap.' " <br>
In addition to his wife and daughter, Campbell is survived by three other daughters, Rosemary Sery of San Francisco and Carol Walburg and Terry Campbell -Lindeke, both of Minneapolis; two brothers, Duncan of Alameda, Calif., and William of Eagle River, Wis., and seven grandchildren. <br>
Visitation will be held from 5 to 7 p.m. today at Gill Brothers, 5801 Lyndale Av. S., Minneapolis. Services will be held at 4 p.m. Friday at the Church of the Visitation, 46th St. and Lyndale Av. S., Minneapolis.<br>

Navy Cross<br>
Awarded for actions during the World War II<br>
The President of the United States of America takes pleasure in presenting the Navy Cross to Captain Colin Campbell, United States Navy, for extraordinary heroism and distinguished service in the line of his profession as Commanding Officer of the Light Cruiser U.S.S. ST. LOUIS (CL-49), during operations in Kula Gulf, Solomon Islands, on 5 and 6 July 1943. As part of a Task Force in close support of the landing of United States troops at Rice Anchorage on New Georgia Island, Captain Campbell skillfully maneuvered his ship through restricted submarine-infested waters and effectively bombarded enemy shore batteries and installations in the face of intense Japanese gun and torpedo fire. Twenty-four hours later, the ST. LOUIS, leading the cruiser formation during one phase of the action, participated in an engagement with a numerically superior Japanese naval force and, through Captain Campbell's brilliant direction of her naval gunfire, assisted materially in the sinking or severe damaging of all the hostile vessels. The inspiring leadership and valiant devotion to duty displayed by Captain Campbell under fire contributed in large measure to the outstanding success of these vital operations and reflect great credit upon the United States Naval Service.<br>

Joseph Paul Campbell, age 91 , passed away on March 6, 2019, at 4:05 p.m. after hearing "The Campbells are Coming" on the bagpipes while surrounded by family.<br>
A few days earlier, Pastor Eda Dorosky led a family prayer circle around Joe, welcoming him with grace to Godʼs table. A memorial service will be scheduled at a teacher-friendly time, with so many family members following in Joeʼs footsteps.<br>
Joe, Oneonta High School Class of 1945, was one of Oneontaʼs most dedicated life-long community members. He was recognized through honors and awards throughout his life. Joeʼs dedication to teaching, coaching, broadcasting, and community service were among his greatest contributions, which were woven through his life as a father, athlete, philosopher, educator, radio personality, music aficionado, and coach.<br>
Except for his motherʼs brief trip to Moosic, PA, to have Joe, he lived his entire life in Oneonta, NY. He entered the Percy I. Bugbee School and was in its first graduating class. At OHS, Joe was a multi-letter athlete and founder of the Saturday Night Club, where he developed his public speaking skills and enjoyed drama with his classmates. He began boxing at an early age, when it was the number 2 sport in America, and trained under Carl Delberta, a gold medalist and professional, world welterweight contender.<br>
Joe served in the US Army from 1945-46.<br>
Among Joeʼs greatest memories, which he shared countless times with family and at the Oneonta Historical Society, were those of working summers on the Section Gang for the D&H Railroad from 1947-52, where he witnessed the American Dream and built many life-long friendships.<br>
Joe went to college on the GI Bill as a World War II veteran.<br>
At Colgate University, he earned a Bachelor of Arts in 1951, majoring in philosophy and studying drama. Joe earned his Master of Science degree in elementary education (ME1) in 1956 at Oneonta State Teachers College (SUNY Oneonta).<br>
He taught grade 5 (1 year) and high school (3 years) and coached football in Walton, NY, in 1953-57. In 1957 Mr. C. came to Oneonta, teaching grade 5 (4 years) and later grade 6 (30 years!), which he truly loved, at the Plains and Greater Plains Elementary Schools and began a long coaching career at OHS. From the 1950s to the 1980s, he was an assistant football coach, baseball coach, JV boys' basketball coach, and girls' basketball coach. During the summers, he coached Babe Ruth Baseball and developed and coached the Kiwanis Grasshopper Baseball youth program in Neahwa Park, where he integrated the first boys' and girls' baseball league in Oneonta. Some of Coach Campbellʼs athletes became pros, including a Super Bowl champion and ESPN broadcaster, who took tips from The Grand Old Man. When Mr. C. retired from teaching in 1991, he asked himself, "What have I done?" and continued volunteering within the district. He lamented snow days and would go into school anyway to greet occasional students. Joe developed leadership and sportsmanship skills in many Oneonta student athletes, skills that would serve them a lifetime as they became productive members of society.<br>
Joe had an incredible 50 years on the air on WDOS radio from 1952-2002 with his radio program, The Sentimental Journey. This was the longest running radio program in Central New York and beyond. He reached out and touched many listeners through the airwaves and made many friendships that lasted a lifetime. Joe was a long-time supporter of the arts, ranging from big band music to New Orleans Jazz to the Glimmerglass Opera. The local music scene was enriched through his airplay, interviews, and support of great artists such as Al Gallodoro, Tommy Joy (his former student), Jack Stahl, Hank Jones, Jerry Jeff Walker, and especially the Big Bands. Joe was also a frequent master of ceremonies for community events, including concerts, boxing and wrestling matches in Neahwa Park, and a tribute to Carl Delberta, complete with boxing-match sound effects.<br>
Joe, and his friend Joe Fioravanti continued to enrich the local arts by serving the community through their course series, The Great American Broadcast, at the Center for Continuing Adult Learning sponsored by Hartwick College and SUNY Oneonta. Joe Fioravanti said this about their Music and Memories of World War II class: "Joe Campbell was a native Oneontan (who parlayed a love of sports with a college major in philosophy) who long combined physical fitness with the pursuit of wisdom. A noted educator, sports buff, and coach, Campbell was best known to thousands of area radio listeners as the Voice of Oneonta. For decades, he broadcast the Yellow Jackets football games on Saturday afternoons, but his passion for jazz and big band swing music made him a local legend. For fifty years his weekend radio show, The Sentimental Journey, earned him the accolade: The Grand Old Man of Radio. He has read Socrates and Spinoza, who had something to say about the mysteries of the human condition. Yet he enjoys a special affinity for the revered poets of Tin Pan Alley, those rhymesters and tunesmiths who brilliantly set to music timeless truths about the ongoing quest for love and beauty between the two lost souls in a world in desperate need of both."<br>
With his friend, Madolyn Palmer, Joe was a long-time supporter of the annual Muscular Dystrophy Associationʼs telethon. Madolyn and Joe more than doubled the local donations. A constant theme throughout his life was his community service. Through Joeʼs many careers, he was always serving the community - reaching out and making connections with everyone. Joe would always find a connection and grow friendships. At his Italian American Club Father of the Year award ceremony in 2002, Judy Campbell offered these poignant words, "My husband is an extraordinary father for the same reasons that he was an excellent teacher. Whatever a child excelled in, he would focus on. His students always left his class with a self-awareness and deep respect for others."<br>
Joe was named Citizen of the Year by the Oneonta Jaycees in 1980 and given the Key to the City in 1997. Being named OHSʼs first Alumni of the Year in 2005 and being inducted onto the OHS Wall of Distinction in 2011 and into the OHS Athletic Hall of Fame in 2016 meant a great deal to Joe and were among his most treasured honors.<br>
Joseph P. Campbell is survived by his wife, Judith A. Campbell, and her 2 children, Alexandra K. Hanson (Todd) and their daughter Nicole M. Hanson, and Melissa A. Rice and her son Joseph A. Rice; his second wife, Barbara A. Campbell, and her 2 children, Michael J. Lynch and Jude B. Lynch; and his first wife, Sally S. Fionte, and their 2 children, Joseph P. Campbell, Jr. (Shawn) and their 2 daughters Elizabeth A. Campbell Vidreiro (Mark) and Emily M. Boulnois (Florian), and Jeffrey S. Campbell and his 3 children Shelby L. Campbell, Nolan R. Campbell, and Delaney M. Campbell. Joe is also survived by his brother William R. Campbell and sister Adah J. Day and her 4 children, Bridget M. McGuinness, Regina E. Ranieri McGuinness (Richard), Meghan A. McGuinness (fiancé Jay Duseau), Christopher R. Day, and her 5 grandchildren.<br>
Joseph was predeceased by his parents, Buchanan H. and Elizabeth A. Campbell, his sister Helen Price, and his 2 brothers John S. Campbell and Buchanan H. Campbell, Jr. Mr. C. was very proud that many of his family members followed in his footsteps and became teachers. We are grateful to Joeʼs former students, athletes, and coworkers for their visits, calls, and cards over the years. Joe was especially grateful for support from his caregivers at Dr. Egal Internal Medicine and Geriatrics, A.O. Fox Hospital, Chestnut Park Rehabilitation & Nursing Center, Hampshire House Assisted Living, Cooperstown Center for Rehabilitation and Nursing, and Bassett Medical Center.<br>
A celebration of Joe's life is being planned for this summer at the Oneonta Boys & Girls Club.<br>

Lauren Ann CANARIO
<p>
<a name ="I031396"><b>[I031396]</b></a><br />
Lauren Canario is a libertarian activist member of the Free State Project residing in Winchester, New Hampshire.<br>
Canario attracted media attention after she was arrested in Connecticut following a peaceful protest in which she refused to budge from a Connecticut citizen's residential property. The land had been forcibly confiscated by the local city government, New London, to be handed over to Pfizer for development. New London's controversial use of eminent domain to seize private individuals' homes and land to hand the property over to an unrelated private business was one of the first such incidents in American history to gain major notice by the press and the public, and the issue culminated in the Supreme Court case Kelo v. New London.[1]<br>
More recently, Canario has shown support[2] for Edward and Elaine Brown, who were convicted of Federal income tax offenses. On September 15, 2007, Lauren Canario was arrested for trying to visit the Browns, who were engaged in an armed standoff with Federal law enforcement officials. She was released without charges that night.[citation needed]<br>
On October 2, 2007, Canario was the subject of a traffic stop in Milford, New Hampshire. She was subsequently arrested for speeding, driving without a license, driving an unregistered vehicle, refusing to obey lawful orders of a police officer, and resisting arrest. Canario has refused to speak or communicate in any way with police, court officials, or jail guards, as she does not recognize the authority of the government. Therefore, she has made no attempt to make bail or retain an attorney, or participate in the jail system enough to make out an approved visitors list. Canario was released on November 7, 2007, after being convicted and sentenced to time served.<br>

Woman Arrested At City Council Meeting Refuses To Speak In Court-Judge stumped<br>
New London Day ^ | Sept. 24, 2005 | ETHAN ROUEN <br>
Posted on 9/24/2005 8:51:50 PM by FortRumbull<br>
New London - Lauren Ann Canario remained silent for a fifth straight day Friday, refusing to make a sound at her second court hearing since she was arrested Monday in a protest over the city's use of eminent domain.<br>
Department of Correction officers used a wheelchair to bring Canario into the New London Superior Courthouse on Broad Street because she refused walk, a correctional officer said.<br>
Dressed in a green prison uniform and unlaced white sneakers with her hands and feet shackled together, Canario's large black eyes were calm, her face halcyon, as Judge Hillary Strackbein and prosecutors tried to extract information from her.<br>
"I don't know what to do with this," Strackbein said before scheduling another court appearance for Oct. 7.<br>
When asked how long she plans to remain in prison, Canario smirked and shrugged.<br>
Canario, 48, who is from Las Vegas, was arrested and charged Monday with first-degree trespass, refusal to be fingerprinted and interfering with police after she refused to leave a City Hall stairwell following the cancellation of a City Council meeting. The topic of the meeting was the New London Development Corp.'s plan to evict residents from houses in the Fort Trumbull neighborhood.<br>
She was taken to court Tuesday, but refused to cooperate with her lawyer or even utter a word. A judge doubled her bond to $10,000, and she was transferred from a holding cell to the Janet S. York Correctional Institution in Niantic.<br>
It was the first time she has been in trouble with the law, said her husband of 27 years, Jim Johnson.<br>
The frustration on the part of judicial officials is just the beginning of a battle that Canario will eventually win, Johnson said.<br>
"These government people are going to lose," he said. "They have nowhere near the strength she has."<br>
A former U.S. Army firefighter and crash-rescue specialist, Canario received a doctorate in art from Hobart Galleries in Ferndale, Calif., Johnson said.<br>
She and her husband, who repairs floor-cleaning equipment, are members of the Free State Project, a New Hampshire-based nonprofit that wants to reduce the role of government and vehemently opposes eminent domain.<br>
Canario rented an apartment from Bill Von Winkle, a Fort Trumbull resident, about a month ago with plans to peacefully fight the city's taking of Von Winkle's property and others by eminent domain. She took a job in Pawcatuck and said she would bring in 6,700 people to protect the land, Johnson said.<br>
Since her arrest, members of the Free State Project and others who promised to join the fight have distanced themselves, Johnson said.<br>
A spokeswoman for the Free State Project did not return calls seeking comment.<br>
"All of these people, basically wussies, will not be showing up," he said.<br>
In response, Johnson is asking people opposed to eminent domain to send teddy bears and toy guns to Canario's apartment at Von Winkle's house. He said he plans to build a piece of art to represent the 6,700 people Canario promised but cannot deliver.<br>
Johnson shares his wife's convictions and said he will move to New London in the next three weeks. The couple hopes to join the Free State Project's plan to move 20,000 activists to New Hampshire.<br>
Johnson has not been able to contact his wife since she was arrested, he said.<br>
"I vacillate from choked up and tearing to I want to kill everyone on the planet," he said.<br>
Still, he sees his wife's predicament as a standoff where the loser will be the first to flinch.<br>
The government "can't back down because she won't kneel before them," he said. "It's just a face off. I can't believe the people of Connecticut aren't up in arms about this. It's a gross injustice."<br>

James "Jim" Kenneth Capen, passed away peacefully Tuesday, March 13, 2018 at the age of 67 as he traded in his worn out earthly vessel for an eternal dwelling with Jesus. He was born March 29, 1950 in Ellensburg, Washington to Janet Sisk and later graduated from Selah High School in 1968. Over the course of his life, Jim would often reflect on his fond memories of growing up in Eastern Washington and spending time with his beloved Grandmother who lived out the love of Jesus in his daily life. Jim Capen first met his wife Kathy Capen while they were both attending Centralia College. After getting married, they spent their early years in Eastern Washington as they began raising their children, and where Jim returned to school at Central Washington University earning his B.S. in Business in 1991. Eventually Jim and Kathy moved to Chehalis, Washington where they have resided the last 27 years where their children attended Chehalis Schools.

Throughout his life, Jim enjoyed spending time serving in various ways in the community including helping coach different kidsʼ sports, volunteering at the Salvation Army, Lewis County Mission and Jail Ministry at different locations in Washington.

Though many would not know it, Jimʼs family regularly witnessed him offering rides and food to those in need, sharing his faith with anyone who would listen, and connecting with and serving the least of these.
