Richard EDGERDEN
<p>
<a name ="I032135"><b>[I032135]</b></a><br />
[Edgerton.FTW]<br>
<br>
Richard Egerden was the only known son of Rychard Egerden.  He was christened at the Parish Church in Wye on June 5, 1539, the parish record reading:  "Richard Egerden the Son of Rychard was baptized on the fyth day of June Ano [1539] [WPR].  Richard was a tanner by trade and resided in the village of Brook throughout his life.  The parish of Brook was formed from the larger parish of Wye in the 1560's.  Thus, while Richard was christened at the Wye Parish Church, all subsequent records of his family are found in the registers of the Brook Parish Church [see Brook Parish Registers; Bishops Transcripts, Volume 30; FHL #1751592, item #5 - hereafter cited as BPR].   Richard was listed as a Sideman in the Brook Parish Register under the year 1581 [BPR, pg. 16].<br>
<br>
Richard Egerden was married twice.  By his first wife, Tamson (Thomasine), he is known to have had at least four children (possibly others who died young):<br>
<br>
1. GREGORY3, christened at the Brook Parish Church on October 8, 1571 [BPR, pg. 6].<br>
<br>
2. ELIZABETH, christened at the Brook Parish Church on March 13, 1575/6 [BPR, pg. 10].<br>
<br>
3. MICHAEL, christened at the Brook Parish Church on February 1, 1579/80 [BPR, pg. 14].<br>
   He married (1) Joan Paine; and (2) Joan Wickens.<br>
   Michael was buried at Faversham, County Kent on March 8, 1628/9.<br>
<br>
4. JOAN, married William Higgenson.<br>
<br>
The burial of Richard's first wife was recorded in the Brook Parish Registers as follows:  "Tamson Egerdon the wiffe of Richard Egerdon was buried the 6th day of September 1604" [BPR, pg. 38].  On the same page of the parish register was entered Richard's remarriage, that is:  "Richard Egerden and Elizabeth Wiggent were married the 9th day of April 1605" [BPR, pg. 38].  Richard and his second wife had two children - twins:<br>
<br>
5. WILLIAM, christened at the Brook Parish Church on January 27, 1607/8 [BPR, pg. 41].<br>
<br>
6. FRANCES, christened at the Brook Parish Church on January 27, 1607/8 [BPR, pg. 41].<br>
   She married (1) Edward Goldsmith; and (2) John Coveney.<br>
<br>
Richard Egerden died in the village of Brook in December 1609, and was buried at the Brook Parish Church on December 31st of that year [BPR, pg. 43].  He left a Last Will and Testament, dated October 28, 1609, which was proved on January 18th of the following year [see Canterbury Probate Records. Archdeaconry Court: Register of Wills. Vol. 56, 1605 - 1618; pp. 354 - 358, FHL #0188954].  A subsequent codicil to the will was dated December 25, 1609, thus placing Richard's death sometime between then and December 31st when he was buried, as aforementioned.  Richard's will mentioned his wife, Elizabeth Egerden, and five surviving children, Michael Egerden my soone", my daughter Joane nowe William Higgensons wyfe", Ffrancis Egerden my youngest daughter, Gregorye Egerden my eldest soone", and William Egerden my youngest soone", as well as two grandsons, Richard Egerden soone of the saide Gregorye and John Egerden my soone Gregoryes second soone.  Also mentioned in the will was a Thomasine Beers, but her relationship (if any) to the Egerden family is not known. According to Duncan Harrington, there was quite a family squabble over Richard's will.<br>

<br>
Richard was remarried on September 23, 1627 at Ashford Parish to Mrs. Joan Harlocke (aka. Hearlock), a widow.  Richard Egerden died sometime prior to January 14, 1640/1, when his widow, Joan Egerden, was remarried at Ashford parish to Nicholas Edgoare (or Edgererr), of Orleston parish.<br>

Rychard EDGERDEN
<p>
<a name ="I032137"><b>[I032137]</b></a><br />
[Edgerton.FTW]<br>
<br>
The documented roots of the Egerden family of Wye, County Kent, England go back to the early part of the sixteenth century.  RYCHARD EGERDEN was born there in the hamlet of Brook, Ashford Parish say 1519.  He is said to have had two siblings, a brother William, and a sister Godlyffe.  The former may have been the "Willyam Egerdon", whose son Willyam was christened at the Wye Parish Church on February 28, 1540/1 [see Church of England: Wye Parish Registers; FHL #1836327, item #13 -  hereafter cited as WPR].  The sister, Godlyffe Egerden, was married to John Allin at the Wye Parish Church on September 23, 1548 [WPR].  A number of other Egerdens were mentioned in the subsequent parish records of Wye and Brook, however their connection to the direct line presented here has not been determined.  It would appear that members of the family resided throughout the parish of Wye, as well as in the neighboring villages of Brook, Brabourne and Faversham.<br>
<br>
There are indications, though unconfirmed, that the Egerden family may have resided in Wye for three or four generations at this time.  Records obtained by Duncan Harrington of Harrington Research Services (Folkestone, County Kent, England) noted the name of "Richard Egerden" in reference to a rental of the Manor of Wye circa 1452-54.  This Richard may have been a grandfather or other paternal relation of Rychard Egerden.<br>
<br>
There is no record of Rychard Egerden's wife, and only one son has currently been traced:<br>
<br>
1. RICHARD, christened at the Wye Parish Church on June 5, 1539.<br>
<br>
Rychard Egerden died three months prior to his son's birth.  He was buried at the Wye Parish Church on March 7, 1538/9, the parish record reading:  "Rychard Egerton was buryed ye vii day of marche 1538"  [WPR]. (Note:  Surrounding entries on this page, together with the posthumous birth of Rychard's son in May or June of 1539, make it certain that the year recorded as "1538" represented old-style dating.)  There is no further mention in the Wye Parish Registers of Rychard's widow.  It is very probable that she was remarried sometime shortly after Rychard's death.  Unfortunately, marriage records for the Wye Parish Church did not commence until the year 1545, thus post-dating any probable remarriage.<br>

Richard EDGERTON
<p>
<a name ="I032129"><b>[I032129]</b></a><br />
[Edgerton.FTW]<br>
<br>
The ancestry of Richard Edgerton has not been conclusively established. However, recent research conducted by Robert C. Edgerton, L. Welch Pogue and Brian G. Edgerton (among others) has produced a preponderance of evidence suggesting that may have been the son of Richard and Ellen (Stroud) Egerden, of Wye, County Kent, England.  Their son, Richard, was christened in the hamlet of Brook (in Ashford parish, Wye) on November 22, 1622.  No further record of this Richard is found in the parish records at Brook or Wye; and as Richard Sr. died prior to 1641, it is quite reasonable to suppose that Richard may have set out on his own, eventually emigrating to the New World, possibly for religious reasons or to escape the political turmoil of the English Civil War.  A "Richard Edgarton" from Ashford Parish in Kent County appears in Volume I of Charles E. Banksʼ Topographical Dictionary of 2885 English  Immigrants to New England, 1620-1650; however, Mr. Bankʼs source for this entry is not known.  For further details on the Egerdens of Wye, County Kent, England, please see The Tentative Ancestry of Richard Edgerton.<br>
<br>
Over the years, a number of alternate theories have been proposed regarding the parentage of Richard Edgerton; however, none have offered any credible evidence to support them.  The most widespread of these, based upon family tradition, claims that Richard was the youngest of four sons of John Edgerton, Earl of Bridgewater.  According to the tradition, Richard emigrated to Saybrook, Connecticut in 1632, along with his elder brother, John (second son of the Earl of Bridgewater).  John Edgerton Sr. died in England in 1649, and upon the subsequent death of the eldest son, John Jr. (as the next-eldest son) returned to England to succeed to the familyʼs title and estates.  Richard remained in America, where he married and became the progenitor of the Connecticut line of Edgertons. This tradition, though long-held, has not yet been supported by any known documentation or research.  There are a number of accounts of a John Edgerton in Saybrook during its early years, but direct evidence of this is also wanting.<br>
<br>
A similar scenario, placing Richard as the son of Sir Rowland Egerton and his wife, Bridget (daughter of Arthur Lord Grey de Wilton), is outlined in The Egertons of Oulton, by Sir Philip de Malpas Grey-Egerton (1869).<br>
<br>
The first mention of Richard Edgerton in America is found on the records of Saybrook, in Middlesex, Connecticut.  From the Town Meeting Notes there, dated January 4, 1648, he was listed as owning a "house lot and three acres and a half of land".  At the same meeting, Richard was held libel for defective fences and allowing hogs in a neighborʼs corn field (see Saybrook Town Records - Printed Edition; Volume I; pg. 156).  In 1650, Richard was among forty proprietors who were granted additional lands in Saybrook.  There are several unconfirmed reports of Richard being in Saybrook as early as 1636 or 1637; but documentary evidence of this has not been presented.<br>
<br>
A plat map of the early layout of Old Saybrook (reconstructed from Volume 1 of the Saybrook Land Records) was compiled in 1935 by Mr. Gilman C. Gates, of the Saybrook Historical Society, for his publication, Saybrook at the Mouth of the Connecticut River.  Richard Edgertonʼs home-lot, as shown on this map, comprised three-and-a-half acres and was located along the North Cove, with the Connecticut River to the north.  The home-lot bordered the Meeting House yard on the south, and the home-lots of Matthew Griswold and Joseph Hingham (to the west) and John Clark (to the east).<br>
<br>
On April 7 (or 8), 1653, Richard Edgerton was married at Saybrook, Connecticut to Mary Sylvester.  The marriage was recorded twice - first at Saybrook (VR I:23), where it was noted only as the "marriage...of Richard Odyushun" (no mention of the brideʼs name), and later at Norwich (VRp I:34).  The former record gives a date of April 8th, while the latter lists a date of April 7th.<br>
<br>
The parentage and ancestry of Mary (Sylvester) Edgerton has not yet been discovered.  The fact that her name was omitted from the Saybrook marriage record indicates that she was almost certainly not of that town, a fact confirmed by the complete absence of any Sylvester families mentioned in the early Saybrook records.  It has been proposed that Mary may have been a daughter of Giles and Mary (Arnold) Sylvester, whose family had settled on Shelter Island in the mid-1600ʼs.  Recent research into this Sylvester family, principally conducted by Mr. Henry B. Hoff, F.A.S.G., would appear to refute this supposition.  For further details, please see The Ancestry of Mary Sylvester, found in the Notes section of this database.<br>
<br>
Richard and Mary Edgerton had three daughters born in Saybrook (Mary, Elizabeth and Anne), their births being recorded as the "children of Richard Odyushun" (VR 1:23), apparently a phonetic spelling for Edgerton, indicating how the name was pronounced at the time.  The family of Richard Edgerton was more fully recorded in the Norwich Vital Records (Volume I, page 34 of the published records), with a few discrepancies of dates.  The dates included here are mainly from the Norwich records, which are generally cited as the more reliable.<br>
<br>
In 1660, the original town of Saybrook was largely abandoned, the majority of its inhabitants moving inland north, where they founded the town of Norwich along the banks of the Thames River.  The land there (comprising approximately nine miles square) had been deeded to them by Uncas, sachem of the Mohegan tribe, in gratitude for the colonistsʼ recent assistance in repelling a siege by the rival Narragansett tribe. The town was sanctioned by the Connecticut General Court in 1659, with the main migration taking place the following year.  Originally known by its Indian name, "Mohegan", the town was renamed Norwich in 1662, probably after Norwich, England, where many of the original settlers had come from.<br>
<br>
Richard Edgerton was one of the thirty-five original proprietors of Norwich, and was granted a home lot, consisting of "six acres, more or less, abutting on land of Thomas Post on the southeast, abutting on the river on the southwest 10 rods & 10 feet, abutting  on the highway 12 rods & 12 feet."  Additional lands were assigned to him in later divisions, as noted in the Norwich Book of Grants.   He was admitted a Freeman of the Colony of Connecticut on May 14, 1668, his name appearing on the Norwich roll of Freemen the following year.  He served as Townsman (selectman) in 1678, and Constable in 1680.  Like the majority of his colonial counterparts, Richard probably earned his livelihood as a farmer and planter.<br>
<br>
Richard and Mary Edgerton had six more children born in Norwich - four sons, John, Richard, Samuel and Joseph; and two more daughters, Sarah and Lydia.  The four sons each married and had families that perpetuated the Edgerton name in Norwich for many generations.  There appears to be no further record of the eldest two daughters, Mary and Elizabeth; they may have died in childhood, perhaps prior to the move to Norwich.  The third daughter, Anne (aka. "Hannah"), is generally reported to have married Thomas Willey "of Colchester", although the primary source of this information is unknown and there is no further account of the couple. The two younger daughters were also married and resided in Norwich - Sarah to Joseph Reynolds, and Lydia to Nathaniel Backus.<br>
<br>
James Savageʼs Genealogical Dictionary of the First Settlers of New England, (Vol. II, pg. 100) provides the following entry for Richard Edgerton:<br>
<br>
"EDGARTON, RICHARD, Saybrook, m. 8 Apr. 1653, Mary Sylvester, had Mary, b. 3 Feb. 1655; Eliz. 25 Dec. 1657; Ann or Hannah, 24 Sept. 1659; rem. next yr. to Norwich, there had John, 12 June 1662, Richard, 10 Mar. 1665; Sarah, Apr. 1667; Samuel, May 1670; Lydia, Apr. 1675; and Joseph, 8 Mar. 1677."<br>
<br>
As of 1982, the Richard Edgerton house was still standing and was at that time one of only three of the original Norwich dwellings still in use. In 1959, the house was moved (due to highway construction) from its original location at 140 West Town Street.  The most recent location was 139 Sturtenvant Street, but it is reported that the city was again re-zoned and the house may have been relocated once again.   A photograph of the Richard Edgerton home (taken in 1982) is provided by Jessie Edgerton Garnerʼs Edgerton Tales and Details, 1836 - 1986 (Hanover, Illinois, 1986; pg. 5)  Robert C. Wolfert, of Ronkonkoma, New York (an Edgerton descendant), has provided some recent photographs of the Richard Edgerton house, taken in October 2000.<br>
<br>
Richard Edgerton died at Norwich, Connecticut in March of 1691/2, his death being noted in the vital records there (VRp I:34).  He left a will, which was proved at New London County Court on June 7, 1692, as noted in the following entry under that date found in the New London County Court Records (unnumbered):<br>
<br>
"The Last Will and Testament of Richard Edgerton Deceased together with an Inventory of sd Estate was Exhibited in Court, proved and ordered to be Recorded & power of administration is granted according to the will."<br>
<br>
The will itself has not been discovered and was probably among those destroyed in a New London fire in September 1781.  The will was referred to in subsequent deeds and land transfers, from which some of its contents may be inferred.  From a Norwich deed dated April 1, 1695, Richard Edgerton sold to his brother Samuel, "all that my thirty acres of land lying on Middle Hill which was given me by my father as appears by his will, which thirty acres was part of my fatherʼs Third Division Lott" (Norwich LR 2A:208).<br>
<br>
It is most likely that Richard divided his Norwich property among his four sons - they are all found owning lands in Norwich in the subsequent years.  At the time of his death, Richard still owned lands in Saybrook, Connecticut, which were apparently bequeathed to his children.  From a Saybrook deed, dated February 16, 1718/9, five of Richardʼs heirs - "Richard Edgerton, Samuel Edgerton, Joseph Edgerton and Joseph Reynolds & Nathaniell Backus in right of their wives Sarah and Lydia Decʼd" - deeded to John Edgerton and Joseph Edgerton, "Grandsons of Richard Edgerton", lands which had belonged to their father Richard Edgerton (Saybrook LR 2:527).<br>
<br>
Richard Edgerton was probably buried in the ancient Norwich burying lot, which lay next to his home.  A memorandum on the Norwich town records notes that:  "The Towne hath purchased a burying place of Thomas Post - in the home lot of said Post - towards the rear of his lot."  This lot was adjacent to the Edgerton home, so it seems certain that Richard would have been interred there, as were most of the early settlers of Norwich. The Norwich Founders Monument, inscribed with the names of the thirty-five original proprietors (including Richard Edgerton), was erected on the site.  The cemetery later became known as the "Post and Gager" Cemetery.<br>
<br>
No death record or burial site has yet been found for Mrs. Mary (Sylvester) Edgerton.<br>

James graduated from Kimball Union Academy in 1862 and Albany University Law Department in 1864, practiced law in Windsor, Vermont for 13 years and was states attorney three years. He was a soldier in the Civil War (54), serving in Co. E, 9th New Hampshire Volunteer Infantry. He enlisted as a Private, 1 August 1862, became a second lieutenant, and resigned 27 October 1862. His unit was part of the 9th Army Corps, Army of the Potomac and fought at South Mountain on September 14th and at Antietam on September 17th (48) (55). His widow later claimed that he had been promoted to Captain and had been Acting Colonel of a colored regiment. When they went into the Battle of Antietam their baggage - tents, blankets, etc - had been left behind and he was taken ill from exposure. The developing arthritis was so bad that he had to resign his commission. He married 5 November 1867, at Boston, Massachusetts, Helen Gertrude Porter, born 1840 at Lowell, Massachusetts, daughter of Lemuel and Wealthy M. Porter. James Nathan died 1 December 1878 at Windsor of T.B<br>

Lemuel Porter EDMINISTER
<p>
<a name ="I100454"><b>[I100454]</b></a><br />
After a few years Lemuel's health required a drier climate and so his mother moved to Colorado. She remarried 1 December 1889, at Denver, Dr. W. W. Hibbard and divorced him in January 1891 because he had a serious chloral addiction. The high altitude at Denver proved bad for Lemuel Porter's health and they moved to San Francisco where she worked as a writer. She had some verses published, too. The son studied law and practiced in San Francisco for a short time. He was very active in the "Military Order of the Loyal Legion of the U. S." and was elected "Companion of the First Class (No. 953), Commandery of California" on 26 January 1892, Insignia No. 9262. On 10 May 1893 he was taken ill of pneumonia and died the same day. He never married. <br>

William "Bill" McCormick Edmondson, 78, of La Conner, WA died Wednesday, July 27, 2005 at Island Hospital. He was born September 13, 1926 in Branson, Missouri, the son of Chester McCormick and Ruth E. (Morrison) Edmondson. His family moved to Okanogan, WA in 1941 and he graduated from Okanogan High School in 1943. In 1944 he entered the U.S. Navy and was discharged a short time later. Bill married Priscilla "Percy" Snider on August 16, 1947 and moved to Seattle, WA. Later, in 1958, he moved his family to Richmond Beach (Shoreline), WA where he was active in the community serving on the local water commission and helped to rebuild the local library. Bill became committed to Scouting and in 1965, he was the Scout Master of Troop 325 for 7 years. He helped start an Explorer Post and was honored by the District Council for his service to Boy Scouting. Bill worked for 30 years as an electronic sales representative. It was his love of boating that brought him to Shelter Bay in La Conner, WA. In search of protective moorage for his boat Poo Pa's II, Bill discovered a community lifestyle that he so enjoyed. After building a home in Shelter Bay, he became involved in many of the yacht club activities, often helping with the Annual Opening Day Picnic and playing Santa at the Christmas Party for the children. Bill served as the Commodore of the Yacht Club from 1986 - 1987 and was also an active member in the Benevolent & Protective Order of Elks. He was truly a loving man, devoted husband for almost 58 years, father, grandfather and friend to many. To the end, Bill was a "nice guy" and a "good scout."

He was a resident for more than 60 years of the Delaware County borough, which in 2007 changed the name of its Triangle Park to Mayor Jack Edmundson Park. Born near Cheshire, England, Mr. Edmundson came to the States when he was 2. A daughter, Joan Drake, said that after he had enlisted in the Army during World War II, "somebody said, 'You're not a citizen.' " That was news to him. So an Army official told him that if he became a citizen, he would be sent to Officer Candidate School, though he was only a high school graduate, Drake said. Mr. Edmundson was an artillery officer during the Battle of the Bulge, his daughter said, and served in the occupation forces in Berlin. A 1938 graduate of Upper Darby High School, he graduated from the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania in 1948. After working for an engineering firm and a car dealership, Mr. Edmundson was an accountant from 1962 to 2003 for Arthur H. Thomas Co., a distributor of scientific equipment in Swedesboro. He was a founding member of the Aldan Swim Club in the 1950s and was its treasurer "off and on for the first 10 years of the club," Drake said. A Boy Scout official, he earned the Silver Beaver Award, given for service of 10 years or longer, and was inducted into the Order of the Arrow, which calls itself "scouting's National Honor Society." He was a life member of the American Legion. Besides his daughter, Mr. Edmundson is survived by sons Jack P. Jr. and Richard, daughter Patricia Lombardo, a brother, 10 grandchildren, 12 great-grandchildren, and two great-great-grandchildren. Janet, his wife of 54 years, died in 2003. A life celebration was set for 9:30 to 11 a.m. Saturday, Sept. 11, at Aldan Union Church, Providence Road and Clifton Avenue, followed by a funeral.
