Fern Fleagle worked as a nurse and educator for 38 years at Mercy and Unity Hospitals<br>
by Kelly Johnson, Staff writer<br>
There was never any question what Fern Fleagle wanted to do with her life.<br>
Nursing has been a calling for the Coon Rapids resident for as long as she can remember.<br>
"It was just something I always wanted to do," Fleagle said.<br>
But, after 38 years of work at Mercy and Unity Hospitals, Fleagle has finally decided to retire.<br>
"It was just time," Fleagle said about the decision.<br>
A move to Coon Rapids in 1960 brought Fleagle to Mercy Hospital.<br>
Before coming to Mercy and Unity Hospitals, Fleagle worked at the University of Minnesota and for Glenwood Hills.<br>
But she spent the bulk of her career working at the Coon Rapids and Fridley hospitals.<br>
"The hospital's a good place to work," Fleagle said about Mercy Hospital.<br>
Fleagle started working part-time as a nurse on the surgical floor at night.<br>
As her children grew, Fleagle added more hours to her schedule and worked different shifts.<br>
In 1978, Fleagle switched from nursing to working as a nurse educator.<br>
There, she handled orientation and patient and staff education programs.<br>
While she enjoyed the work, she found she missed having direct contact with patients.<br>
"You get almost an instant gratification from patients," Fleagle said.<br>
But, she found education rewarding in other ways.<br>
"I liked preparing people to do their jobs the best they can," Fleagle said.<br>
Fleagle is not leaving Mercy and Unity Hospitals empty-handed - she is taking years of good memories with her.<br>
"It's been a very rewarding career for me," Fleagle said. "It's been more than a career. It's been my life."<br>
"I've just been so blessed."<br>
While she doesn't have any specific plans for retirement, Fleagle hopes to spend more of her time doing volunteer work.<br>
"I don't just want to stay home," she said. "I want to do something for people."<br>
Fleagle's last official day working at the two hospitals was Feb. 4.<br>
A retirement tea was held in Fleagle's honor Feb. 18, at Mercy Hospital.<br>
