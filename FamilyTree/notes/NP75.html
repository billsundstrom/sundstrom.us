Jean CARRITHERS
<p>
<a name ="I091725"><b>[I091725]</b></a><br />
B. Jean Carrithers Cornett died on Friday, February 6, 2015. She was matriarch of the Cornett family and well-known nationally for her work with the Festival of the Bluegrass, which she and her husband Bob founded in 1974. She was 86 years old. <br>
Jean was kind, intelligent, thoughtful, creative, tough, and a feminist before her time. She taught girls to be strong and boys to be kind. She brought laughter and music to the world, even when she didn't feel much like laughing. <br>
Jean was born in Troy, North Carolina, on January 14, 1929. She moved to Berea, Kentucky to attend boarding school and college and it was there that she met her husband and fellow dreamer, Bob Cornett . They were married in January 1951 and over the course of the next two decades had 6 sons: Roy, Robert, Hugh, John, James, and Charles. She improved the lives of people in many ways including, but not limited to, creating the Great Crossing Water District and developing some of the county's most beautiful neighborhoods. <br>
In 1985, Jean 's entrepreneurial spirit took her to Suwannee County, Florida where she and Bob purchased a former county park and developed the Spirit of the Suwannee Music Park. The Park became a place of joy for Jean as she cultivated her skills in woodworking, stained glass, and architecture. Here too, she created a community of folks who shared her love for the outdoors, music, and each other. <br>
But Jean 's greatest source of pride was her family of nearly 50 children, grandchildren, and great-grandchildren. Whether it was baking blueberry muffins or sharing stories of her boys' mischievous younger days, Grandma always had time for her children, grandchildren and great-grandchildren. She was their role model, inspiration, and ally. <br>
Jean is survived by her husband, Bob Cornett , sisters Helen Kinkaid and Margaret White, sons Roy, Robert (Linda), John (Barb), James (Robin), Charles (Vicki) and daughter in law, Patty, as well as 22 grandchildren and their spouses and 13 great grandchildren. <br>
She is preceded in death by her parents, Oliver Roy Carrithers and Leah Agnes (Wiseman) Carrithers , her brothers Charles and Paul, and her son, Hugh. <br>
Visitation will be held at Tucker, Yocum, and Wilson funeral home on Wednesday, February 11, from 5:00 to 9:00. <br>
The funeral will be held at Cardome Center on Thursday, February 12 at noon. <br>
