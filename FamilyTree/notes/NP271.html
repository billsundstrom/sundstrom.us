<h2>Notes</h2>
Sitric IVARSSON
<p>
<a name ="I009759"><b>[I009759]</b></a><br />
Carol (Seejay51) stated that Sitric (she named him "Halfdansson" implying that he was son of Halfdan?) was father of Sitric King of Dublin & York. Todd Farmerie stated that the name of his father was not known, and naming one's son after the father was not common custom. Todd did state that Sitric, King of Dublin & York, was grandson of Inguar of Dublin (who I take to be another name for Ivar the Boneless).<br>
<br>
Stewart Baldwin, reviewing a book "Scandinavian Kings in the British Isles, 850-880" by Smyth, stated that Smyth said Sitric's father was also named Sitric (d. 896). Stewart Baldwin did not agree with the name (it was not the practice to name one's son after one's self), but did verify that Sitric King of Dublin & York was grandson of Ivar.<br>
<br>
Stewart Baldwin, on his website entitled "The Kings of the Isle of Man", in the notes under "Table 1: Kings of Dublin" states that Ivar had a son Sitric, who died in 896. However he does not connect that Sitric with Sitric King of Dublin & York; EXCEPT to say that Harald King of Limerick, if not son of one Sitric, could be the son of the other Sitric, which seems to imply a relationship between the two Sitrics.<br>
<br>
Note: Obviously this generation was named something, and "Sitric" is the only name given, so I am using it, even if possibly/probably wrong.<br>

Berengar II of IVREA
<p>
<a name ="I005408"><b>[I005408]</b></a><br />
Berengar of Ivrea (?-966), sometimes also referred to as Berengar II of Italy was marquess of Ivrea, and later King of Italy. He was later deposed by the Emperor Otto I, and Italy came under direct control of the Holy Roman Empire.<br>
<br>
At the death of king Lothaire II of Italy in 950, Berengar seized the opportunity and declared himself King. He tried to legitimize his rule by forcing Adelaide, the respective daughter, daughter-in-law, and widow of the last three kings of Italy, into marriage with his son Adalbert. Adelaide's requests for intervention resulted in Otto I's invasion in 951, where Berengar was forced to pay homage to the Emperor. Otto, a widower, subsequently married Adelaide.<br>
<br>
Berengar continued in his position as a vassal of the Empire. He intrigued with Pope John XII against Otto, and was eventually captured and imprisoned in 963.Second marriage to Willa Princess of Tuscany, b. about 924 in Tuscany<br>
Children by that marriage:<br>
  Rosele "Susanna" , Princess of Italy b: ABT 945 in  Luxembourg<br>
  Adalbert Marquis of Ivrea b: ABT 947 in  Italy<br>
-----------------------------------------<br>
Berengar II (c. 900 - 4 August 966) was the King of Italy from 950 until his deposition in 961. He was a scion of the Anscarid and Unruoching dynasties, and was named after his maternal grandfather, Berengar I. He succeeded his father as Margrave of Ivrea around 923 (whence he is often known as Berengar of Ivrea), and after 940 led the aristocratic opposition to Kings Hugh and Lothair II. In 950 he succeeded the latter and had his son, Adalbert crowned as his co-ruler. In 952 he recognised the suzerainty of Otto I of Germany, but he later joined a revolt against him. In 960 he invaded the Papal States, and the next year his kingdom was conquered by Otto. Berengar remained at large until his surrender in 964. He died imprisoned in Germany two years later.<br>

Alfonso Fernandez de Leon IX
<p>
<a name ="I008274"><b>[I008274]</b></a><br />
From Wikipedia<br>
<br>
Alfonso IX of León (August 15, 1171 - September 23 or 24, 1230; ruled from 1188-1230), first cousin of Alfonso VIII of Castile, and numbered next to him as being a junior member of the family, is said by Ibn Khaldun to have been called the Baboso or "Slobberer", because he was subject to fits of rage during which he foamed at the mouth.<br>
<br>
Alfonso was the only son of King Ferdinand II of Leon and Urraca of Portugal. Though he took a part in the work of the reconquest, this king is chiefly remembered by the difficulties into which his successive marriages led him with the pope. He was first married in 1191 to his cousin Teresa of Portugal, who bore him two daughters, and a son who died young.<br>
<br>
The marriage was declared null by the pope, to whom Alfonso paid no attention till he was presumably tired of his wife. It cannot have been his conscience which constrained him to leave Teresa, for his next step was to marry Berenguela of Castile in 1197, who was his second cousin. For this act of contumacy the king and kingdom were placed under interdict.<br>
<br>
The pope was, however, compelled to modify his measures by the threat that if the people could not obtain the services of religion they would not support the clergy, and that heresy would spread. The king was left under interdict personally, but to that he showed himself indifferent, and he had the support of his clergy. Berenguela left him after the birth of five children, and the king then returned to Teresa, to whose daughters he left his kingdom by will.<br>
<br>
Alfonso's children by Teresa of Portugal were:<br>
   1. Sancha (c. 1192-1270)<br>
   2. Dulce, also called Aldonza (c. 1195-c.1243)<br>
   3. Fernando (1204-August 1214)<br>
<br>
His eldest daughter, Sancha, was engaged to her cousin King Henry I of Castile, but Henry died in 1217 before the marriage could be solemnized. Wanting to disinherit his eldest son, Fernando, King Alfonso invited John of Brienne to marry his daughter Sancha and thusly inherit the Leonese throne. However, Queen Berenguela convinced John of Brienne to marry one of her daughters instead. Though she was the nominal heiress on her father's death in 1230, Sancha was easily set aside by Berenguela and Fernando. Sancha became a nun at Cozollos, where she died in 1270; she was later beatified. Her sister Dulce-Aldonza spent her life with their mother in Portugal.<br>
<br>
Alfonso's children by Berenguela of Castile were:<br>
   1. Leonor (1198/99-October 31, 1210)<br>
   2. King Fernando III (1200-<br>
   3. Berenguela (1201-1237), married John of Brienne<br>
   4. Alfonso, Lord of Molina (1203-1272)<br>
   5. Constanza (1205-September 7, 1242), became a nun at Las Huelgas<br>
