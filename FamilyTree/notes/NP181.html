From Wikipedia<br>
<br>
Robert Fitzhamon (died March 1107) was Lord of Gloucester and the conqueror of Glamorgan.<br>
<br>
He was a cousin of William the Conqueror, although the details of his descent from the Norman dukes is uncertain. His family held the lordships of Torigny, Creully, Mézy, and Evrecy in Normandy.<br>
<br>
Robert probably did not fight at Hastings, and does not appear in the Domesday Book, although some relatives may. He first comes to prominence as a supporter of William Rufus during the Rebellion of 1088. After the revolt failed he was rewarded with great estates in Gloucestershire and elsewhere. Some of these had belonged to the late Queen Matilda, and were supposed to be inherited by Rufus's younger brother Henry (the future Henry I); nevertheless Fitzhamon remained on good terms with Henry.<br>
<br>
The chronology of Fitzhamon's conquest of Glamorgan is uncertain, but it probably took place in the decades after he received Gloucester.<br>
<br>
Legend has it that Robert had ominous dreams in the days before Rufus' fatal hunting expedition, which postponed but did not prevent the outing. He was one of the first to gather in tears around Rufus' corpse, and he used his cloak to cover the late king's body on its journey to be buried in Winchester. How much of these stories are the invention of later days is unknown.<br>
<br>
In any case Fitzhamon proved as loyal to Henry I as he had been to his predecessor, remaining on Henry's side in the several open conflicts with Henry's brother Robert Curthose. He was one of the three barons who negotiated the 1101 truce between Henry I and Robert Curthose.<br>
<br>
In 1105 he went to Normandy and was captured while fighting near his ancestral estates near Bayeux. This was one of the reasons Henry crossed the channel with a substantial force later that year. Fitzhamon was freed, and joined Henry's campaign, which proceeded to besiege Falaise. There Fitzhamon was severely injured in the head; although he lived two more years he was never the same mentally.<br>
<br>
Fitzhamon married Sibyl, daughter of Roger of Montgomery, 1st Earl of Shrewsbury, and Mabel of Bêlleme, by whom he probably only had one child, Mabel, who inherited his great estates and married Robert of Gloucester. Fitzhamon's Gloucestershire property became the nucleus of the Earldom of Gloucester later given to his son-in-law.<br>

Herbert filled his father's place at court, and married one of the numerous mistresses of Henry I, Sibil (or Adela) Corbet, mother of Reginald de Dunstanville, Earl of Cornwall, and daughter and co-heir of the Domesday baron, Robert Corbet, on whom the King had bestowed the Royal manor of Alcester or Worcestershire. They, again, had three sons: 1. Robert; 2. Herbert; and 3. Henry. [Battle Abbey Roll I:61]<br>

What are the sources for HERBERT FITZHERBERT being 'dead by 1155' and 'was dead in 1165'? He appears to have been alive and witnessing at least two deeds after 1170. Both deeds are for Herbert FitzHerbert's half-brother Reginald, Earl of Cornwall, (Deeds of the Redvers family, App II, 15a and 15b.)<br>
<br>
Herbert Fitz Herbert who married Sibyl Corbet and died in 1154, or at least by 1165, was FATHER of another Herbert Fitz Herbert. The younger man was living in 1165, and died about 1235. As Sibyl Cobet is supposed to be mistress of Henry I and mother of Reginald, Earl of Cornwall, it's the younger Herbert mentioned in your deeds.<br>

Herbert FITZHERBERT
<p>
<a name ="I016259"><b>[I016259]</b></a><br />
Robert FitzHerbert, "the third lineal Chamberlain of his family, succeeded to the office and estate of his father, ere Henry II had been three months on the throne of England," and had d.s.p. before 1165. His heir was his brother Herbert, whose wife Lucia was a daughter, and eventually co-heiress of Milo de Gloucester, Earl of Hereford, Lord High Constable of England. For some reason or other, that remains unexplained, this Herbert was out of favour with Henry II. "It is evident that he was admitted to far less than a full share of the inheritance which should have come to him by his wife and mother; and there is some proof that at one period he was under total forfeiture. . . Before King Richard had reigned a year he recovered part of his wife's inheritance, and later on the moiety of Alcester." (Eyton) His sons were: 1. Reginald, who left no children; 2. Peter, his successor; and 3. Matthew, the reputed ancestor of Vincent FitzHerbert surnamed Le Finch of Netherfield in East Sussex, from whom the Earls of Winchilsea claim descent. But, according to Eyton's pedigree, Matthew's grandson and last male representative, Matthew FitzJohn, who was summoned to parliament in 1296, died s.p. in 1309-10. [Battle Abbey Rolls II:61-62]<br>

Herbert Fitz-Herbert obtained from Henry II a confirmation of the landed possessions of his father and, likewise, the office of chamberlain. In the 12th of that monarch, anno 1166, upon the assessment of the aid which was then levied for marrying the king's daughter, he certified that he held one knight's fee in Wilts and three in Berks. Upon the Conquest of Ireland, Henry II, at a great council held at Oxford anno 1177, gave the kingdom of Limerick in that Realme to this Herbert and William his brother, Reginald, Earl of Cornwall, and Josceline de la Pomerai, their nephew, (the City of Limerick and one cantred excepted, which the king reserved to himself and his heirs) to be held by the service of sixty knight's fees, but it appears they declined the gift. In the 6th of Richard I, he was sheriff of the county of Gloucester, for one of that year and afterwards during the whole reign of that king. In the eighth of the same reign, anno 1197, he was likewise sheriff of Shropshire.<br>

Peter Fitz-Herbert, Baron of Berstaple in Devonshire, the honor of which he obtained from King John with fifteen knight's fees, part of the lands of William de Braose, and he was made Governor of Pickering Castle in Yorkshire, and Sheriff of that county by the same monarch. This Peter was one of the barons named in Magna Carta and, by his signature, fourth in rank amongst the barons. He m. first, Alice, dau. of Robert Fitz Roger, a great baron in Northumberland, Lord of Warkworth and Clavering, and sister of John, to whom Edward I gave the surname of Clavering, Lord of Callaly in Northumberland. By this lady he had a son and heir, Reginald Fitz Peter. He m. secondly, Isabel, dau. and coheir of William de Braose, and widow of David Llewellin, Prince of Wales, and by the alliance acquired the lordships and castle of Blenlevenny and Talgarth in the county of Brecknock, with other possessions in Wales.

Peter Fitz-Herbert, who, being very obsequious to King John, was reputed one of that prince's evil counsellors. In 1214, he was constituted governor of Pykering Castle, co. York, and sheriff of the shire; but afterwards falling off in his allegiance, his lands at Alcester were seized by the crown, and given to William de Camvill. Returning, however, to his duty upon the accession of Henry III, those lands were restored to him.

</p>
Eustace FITZJOHN
<p>
<a name ="I016271"><b>[I016271]</b></a><br />
Eustace FitzJohn (d 1157), judge and constable of Chester, was the son of John de Burgh, and the nephew and heir of Serlo de Burgh, lord of Knaresborough, and the founder of its castle. Like his brother, Pain Fitzjohn, he became attached to the court of Henry I. He witnessed some charters of 1183. In the only extant Pipe Roll of Henry's reign he appears as acting as justice itinerant, in the north in conjunction with Walter Espec. He won Henry's special favour, received grants that mde him very powerful in Yorkshire, and was reputed to be a man of great wisdom. Dugdale gives from manuscript sources a list of Henry's donations to Eustace. He was also governor of Bamburgh Castle. He witnessed the charter of Archbishop Thurstan to Beverley. On the death of Henry, Fitzjohn remained faithful to the cause of Matilda, and was in consequence taken into custody and deprived of his governorship of Bamburgh. He joined David, kin of Scots, when that king invaded the north in 1138. He surrendered Alnwick Castle to David, and held out against Stephen in his own castle of Malton. He was present at the Battle of the Standard, where he and his followers fought alongside the men of 'Cumberland' and Tevictdale in the second line of King David's host. In the latter part of Stephen's reign he lived quietly in the north under the government of the Scottish king, by whose grants his possessions were confirmed.<br>
<br>
Fitzjohn was a lavish patron of the chruch and the special friend of new orders of regulars. In 1131 he witnessed the charter by which his colleague, Walter Espec, founded Rievaulx, the first Cistercian house established in Yorshire. When the first monks of Fountains were in the direst distress and had given away their last loaves in charity, Eustace's timely present of a load of bread from Knaresborough was looked on as little less than a miracle. He also made two gifts of lands to Fountains. In 1147 he founded the abbey of Alnwick for Premonstratensian canons. This was the first house of that order in England, and was erected only two years after the order was founded. Fitzjohn was a friend of St Gilbert of SEmpringham, and established two of the earliest houses for the mixed convents of canons and nuns called, after their founder, the Gilbertines. Between 1147 and 1154 Fitzjohn, in conjunction with his second wife, Agnes, founded a Gilbertine house at Watton in Yorkshire, and another at Old Malton in the same country. A few years later his grants to Malton were confirmed. He also made grants to the monks of St Peter's Gloucester, the chruch of Flamborough, and to the Austin canons of Bridlington.<br>
<br>
Fitzjohn made two rich marriages. His first wife was Deatrice, daughter and heiress of Ivo de Vesci. She brough him Alnwick and Malton. She died at the birth of his son by her, William, who adopted the name of Vescy, and was active in the public service during the reign of Henry II, and was sheriff of Northumberland between the fourth and sixteenth years of Henry II. He was the ancestor of the Barons de Vescy. His son Eustace was prominent among the northern barons, whose revolt from John led to the signing of the Magna Charta. Fitzjohn's second wife was Agnes, daughter of William, Baron of Halton and constable of Chester, one of the leading lords of that palatinate. He obtained from Earl Ranulph II of Chester a grant of his father-in-law's estates and titles. He was recogised in the grant as leading counsellor to the earl, 'above all the nobles of that country.' In his new capacity he took part in Henry II's first disastrous expedition into Wales, and was slain (July 1157) in the unequal fight when the king's army fell into an ambush at Basingwerk. He was then an old man. By his second wife he left a son, Richard Fitzeustace, the ancestor of the Claverings and the Lacies. [Dictionary of National Biography VI:183-4]<br>

<br>
EUSTACE FITZJOHN, brother and heir male, was born before 1100. He became possessed of his father's manor of Saxlingham and made a further gift of 20s. therefrom to Gloucester Abbey. Like his brothers he became a trusted officer of Henry I. He first appears as a witness to a royal charter before 1120 (1116-19), after which he constantly attests Henry I's charters, &c. In 1130 he and William de Luvetot were keepers of Tickhill Castle and the Honor of Blyth, and Eustace farmed Aldborough and Knaresborough. He was acting then as a Justice itinerant in the north, usually with Walter Espec. He is said to have become an intimate friend of Henry I, who granted him large estates and made him Constable of Bamburgh Castle. In consequence of his 1st marriage, he held Alnwick Castle in Northumberland and Malton Castle in Yorkshire. He was at Stephen's Easter court at Westminster in 1136 and later was with him at Clarendon. When Stephen advanced against the King of Scots early in 1138 and pursued him across the border, Eustace was in his army; but the King, hearing that some of his barons were traitors, arrested Eustace, and deprived him of the command of the castles which Henry had entrusted to him. Angered by this treatment Eustace, when the King of Scots invaded England later in the year, joined him and marched with him into Yorkshire, where he put David in possession of Malton Castle. At the Battle of the Standard, 22 August 1138, he fought in David's army, in Prince Henry's division beside the men of Cumberland and Teviotdale, but he was wounded and escaped with difficulty to his castle.<br>
<br>
In or before 1139 he became Constable of Chester in right of his 2nd wife. In 1139, when peace had been concluded between England and Scotland and Stephen had given Northumberland to Prince Henry, the Prince confirmed to Eustace all the grants which he had received from Henry I and made him further grants of lands. Eustace was evidently reconciled to Stephen, as he was with the King at Stamford before Easter 1142. During the remainder of the reign he seems to have remained quiescent, living as a great baron of the north, where he even coined his own silver pennies. On 30 November 1143 he was one of those who arranged a truce between the rival bishops of Durham. He is also found attesting, as Constable of Chester, charters of the Earls of Chester. In February 1154/5 he was probably with Henry II at York; about June 1157 he was with him at Waltham; and in the following month he took part in the King's expedition into North Wales. He founded Alnwick Abbey for Premonstratensian canons, and between 1147 and 1154 he founded Gilbertian Convents at Watton and Malton. He was a benefactor to the Abbeys of Gloucester, Fountains, and Bridlington.<br>
<br>
He married, 1stly, Beatrice, only daughter and heir of Yves DE VESCY, lord of Alnwick and Malton, by [it is said] "Alda" only daughter and heir of William Tyson, also lord of Alnwick and Malton. She died in childbirth. He married, 2ndly, Agnes, elder sister and coheir of William and daughter of William FITZNEEL, both Barons of Halton in the palatinate of Chester and Constables of Chester. Eustace died in July 1157, being slain when part of Henry II's army was ambushed in the pass of Consyllt, near Basingwerk, in North Wales. His widow married Robert FITZCOUNT, apparently an illegitimate son of an Earl of Chester. He became Constable of Chester jure uxoris and died in or before 1166. [Complete Peerage XII/2:272-4, (transcribed by Dave Utzinger)]<br>
<br>
--------------------------------<br>
<br>
James Tait ("Knight-Service in Cheshire" [English Historical Review 57], 450)<br>
says that after William, son of William FitzNigel died without issue, Earl Ranulph granted the constableship to Eustace FitzJohn, husband of Agnes, eldest sister and coheiress of William II. The actmacl charter by which Earl Ranulph granted the honor is printed in _A Medieval Miscellany for Doris Mary Stenton_[Pipe Roll Society, 1962] uder the authorship of Geoffrey Barraclough ("Some charters of the Earls of Chester"), 28-9. Barraclough states that Eustace fitz John's first wife, the heiress of Ivo de Vesci, died in childbirth, and that he then married Agnes, sister of William, constable of Chester, who succeeded his father [the Domesday baron] in the barony of Halton about 1130. After William [II] died childess, his inheritance was divided between his two sisters, Agnes, and Matilda, wife of Albert Grelley, lord of Manchester.<br>
<br>
At one point, when Earl Ranulf was 'at loggerheads' with King David of Scotland, Eustace had sided with Scotland (remember, this was during the reign and struggle of King Stephan). After the battle of Lincoln (2 Feb. 1141), Ranulf was forced into league with the Empress Matilda against Stephan, and the Earl and Eustace were again on the same side. The date of the charter by which Eustace fitz John succeeded to the constableship is estimated to be about 1144-5. He would not have granted it to an enemy,and the grant specifically states it was hereditary ("Eustachius et heredes sui"). Eustace was also a Justice itinerant, commanded Scottish troops against Stephen at the battle of Standard in 1138, and founded the Abbeys of Alnwick, Old Malton and Watton. He was slain in Wales in 1157.<br>

Eustace Fitz-John (nephew and heir of Serlo de Burgh, founder of Knaresborough Castle), one of the most powerful of the northern barons and a great favourite with King Henry I.

He m. 1st, Agnes, eldest dau. of William Fitz Nigel, Baron of Halton, constable of Chester. By this lady he acquired the Barony of Halton, and had an only son, Richard Fitz-Eustace.

<br>
Eustace Fitz-John, nephew and heir of Serlo de Burgh (of the great family of Burgh), the founder of Knaresborough Castle, in Yorkshire, and son of John, called Monoculus, from having but one eye, is said by an historian of the period in which he lived, to have been "one of the chiefest peers of England," and of intimate familiarity with King Henry I, as also a person of great wisdom and singular judgment in councils. He had immense grants from the crown and was constituted governor of the castle of Bamburg, in Northumberland, temp. Henry I, of which governorship, however, he was deprived by King Stephen, but he subsequently enjoyed the favour of that monarch. He fell the ensuing reign, anno, 1157, in an engagement with the Welsh, "a great and aged man, and of the chiefest English peers, most eminent for his wealth and wisdom." By his first wife, the heiress of Vesci, he had two sons, and by Agnes, his 2nd wife, dau. of William FitzNigel, Baron of Halton, and constable of Chester, he left another son, called Richard Fitz-Eustace.

William FITZOSBERN
<p>
<a name ="I005269"><b>[I005269]</b></a><br />
From Wikipedia<br>
<br>
William fitzOsbern (died February 22, 1071) was a relative and close counselor of William the Conqueror who became one of the great magnates of early Norman England. He was created Earl of Hereford in 1067, one of the first peerage titles in the English peerage.<br>
<br>
He was the son of Osbern the Steward, a nephew of Duchess Gunnor, the wife of duke Richard I of Normandy. Osbern became the steward of his cousin duke Robert I of Normandy, and when Robert left the duchy to his young son William, Osbern was one of duke William's guardians. He was killed defending the person of duke William against an assassination attempt, sometime around 1040.<br>
<br>
Osbern had married Emma, a daughter of count Rodolf of Ivry, who was a half-brother of Richard I. Through her he inherited a large property in central Normandy, including the honors of Pacy and Breteuil.<br>
<br>
William fitzOsbern was probably raised at the court of his cousin and namesake duke William, and like his father became one of the ducal stewards. He was one of the earliest and most vigorous advocates of the invasion of England, and tradition holds that he convinced the doubters amongst the Norman barons of the feasibility of the invasion.<br>

fitzOsbern's younger brother Osbern was one of Edward the Confessor's chaplains, and possessed the rich church of Bosham in Sussex, and was well-placed to pass along intelligence on the situation in England. He later became bishop of Exeter.<br>
<br>
As duke William took control of England (becoming William I of England), fitzOsbern was given charge of the Isle of Wight, and then in 1067 was given the status of an earl. He is generally considered earl of Hereford, though his authority may have extended to some of the neighboring shires as well. In any case, that part of England was not yet under Norman control; the understanding must have been that fitzOsbern was to take charge of their conquest when he was able.<br>
<br>
Also for the central part of 1067 the king returned to Normandy, leaving fitzOsbern (along with Odo of Bayeux) in charge of England. The king was back in England in 1068, and fitzOsbern accompanied him in the subdual of southwest England. He attended the king's Whitsun court in May, and then himself paid a visit to Normandy, where he fell ill for some months.<br>
<br>
In February or March of 1069 fitzOsbern was given charge of the new castle at York, but he returned south in time to attend the king's Easter court in April. Anglo-Saxon resistance in the west Midlands was subdued later in 1069, and it is likely fitzOsbern played a major part in this, though the details are not certain. During this time fitzOsbern and his followers pushed on into Wales, beginning the conquest of Gwent.<br>
<br>
As part of the assertion of Norman control over England (and Wales), fitzOsbern was one of the major Norman castle builders. Early castles attributed to him include Carisbrooke, Chepstow, Wigmore, Monmouth, and Striguil, as well as creating or improving the fortifications of the towns of Hereford and Shrewsbury.<br>
<br>
In 1070 trouble arose in Flanders, where king William's brother-in-law Baldwin VI of Flanders had died, leaving his county and his young sons in the hands of his widow Richilda. Her control of Flanders was challenged by the brother of her late husband, Robert the Frisian. Looking for help, she offered herself in marriage to fitzOsbern. He could not resist the chance to become de facto count of the richest principality in France, and hurried there with a small and hastily gathered force. They were defeated, and fitzOsbern was killed, at the Battle of Cassel in February 1071.<br>
<br>
fitzOsbern married Adeliza, daughter of Roger I of Tosny (it is also possible that he married Richilda, the dowager countess of Flanders, shortly before his death). He was succeeded in Normandy by his eldest son, William of Breteuil, and in England and Wales by his younger son, Roger of Breteuil. His daughter Emma married Ralph de Gael, earl of Norfolk.<br>

Geoffrey FITZPIERS
<p>
<a name ="I015118"><b>[I015118]</b></a><br />
From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia.<br>
<br>
Geoffrey Fitz Peter, 1st Earl of Essex, (Piers de Lutegareshale), (b. ca. 1162), d. 1213, was a prominent part of the government of England during the reign of Richard I and John.<br>
<br>
The patronymic is sometimes rendered Fitz Piers.<br>
<br>
He was from a modest landowning family that had a tradition of service in mid-ranking posts under Henry II. Geoffrey's elder brother Simon was at various times sheriff of Northamptonshire, Buckinghamshire, and Bedfordshire. Geoffrey, too, got his start in this way, as sheriff of Northamptonshire for the last five years of Henry II's reign.<br>
<br>
Around this time Geoffrey married Beatrice de Say, daughter and eventual co-heiress of William de Say. He was the son of William de Say, 3rd Baron de Say, and Beatrice, sister of Geoffrey de Mandeville, 1st Earl of Essex. This connection with the Mandeville family was to prove unexpectedly important.<br>
<br>
In 1184 Geoffrey's father-in-law died, and he received a share of the de Say inheritance.<br>
<br>
When Richard I left on crusade, he appointed Geoffrey one of the five judges of the king's court, and thus a principal advisor to bishop Hugh of Durham, who was chief justiciar was one of the regents during the king's absence. Later that year, Geoffrey's wife's cousin William de Mandeville, 3rd Earl of Essex died, leaving no direct heirs. His inheritance was disputed between Geoffrey and his in-laws, and Geoffrey used his political influence to eventually obtain it for himself.<br>
<br>
On July 11, 1198 King Richard appointed Geoffrey 'Chief Justiciar', which at that time effectively made him the king's principal minister. He continued in this capacity after the accession of king John. On his coronation day the new king also recognized Geoffrey as Earl of Essex.<br>
Spouse:<br>
    * m. Beatrice de Say.<br>
    * m. Aveline, daughter of Roger de Clare, Earl of Hertford.<br>
<br>
<br>
Children of Beatrice: (note that his sons by this marriage took the de Mandeville surname)<br>
          o Geoffrey de Mandeville, 2nd Earl of Essex.<br>
          o William FitzGeoffrey de Mandeville, 3rd Earl of Essex.<br>
          o Henry, Dean of Wolverhampton.<br>
          o Maud Fitzgeoffrey, who married Henry de Bohun, 1st Earl of Hereford.<br>
<br>
<br>
Children of Aveline:<br>
          o John Fitzgeoffrey, Lord of Shere and Justiciar of Ireland.<br>
          o Cecily Fitzgeoffrey.<br>
          o Hawise Fitzgeoffrey.<br>
<br>
Geoffrey's first two sons died without issue. Apparently the earldom was associated with their mother's Mandeville heritage, for the earldom was inherited by the husband of their sister instead of their half-brother.<br>

Roger Fitz-Richard who was feudal Baron of Warkworth, co. Northumberland, a lordship granted to him by King Henry II, m. Alianor, dau. and co-heir of Henry of Essex, Baron of Raleigh, and was s. by his only son, Robert Fitz-Roger.

<br>
Roger Filius Richardi de Wrkewrthe, a 'nepos' of Earl Hugh Bigod, according to his brother-in-law William de Vere in his Miracles of St Osyth. This description may indicate that his father Richard married an otherwise unknown daughter of Roger Bigod, though it is equally possible that the lady in question was a sister or niece of Roger Bigod. The only other hint as to his family comes from the same source, where he is given an uncle Thomas de Candelent; see C Clay, 'The ancestry of the early lords of Warkworth', Archaeologia Aeliana, 4th ser. 32 (1954), 65-71. Clay suggested we read 'Candelent' as Canteloup, the name of a family later found in the area; cf Walter de Canteloup, one of the two persons holding in 1166 from de Mandeville the Domesday fief of Germund de St Ouen. However, 'Candelent' is the Latin form found in Domesday for the manor of Candlet in Suffolk, which the Englishman Norman the Sheriff held of Roger Bigod in 1086. Roger's charter for Rochester made a grant for Norman's soul as Roger and his wife's predecessor in manors they were granting. Could it be that a family link had been forged between the Bigods and the issue of Norman? Roger fitz Roger was granted Warkworth in Northumberland in 1157 by Henry II; he returned a Carta for one fee held in chief in 1166. His wife was Adelisa, daughter of Alberic II de Ver, previously wife of Robert of Essex, probably a brother of Henry of Essex. Father of Robert fitz Roger, who acquired the barony of Whalton, Northumberland, a second son, and Alice, wife of John, constable of Chester. [Domesday Descendants p948]<br>

William FITZROBERT
<p>
<a name ="I007370"><b>[I007370]</b></a><br />
William Fitz Robert, 2nd Earl of Gloucester (died 1183) was the son and heir of Sir Robert de Caen, 1st Earl of Gloucester, and Mabel of Gloucester, daughter of Robert Fitzhamon. His father was an illegitimate son of King Henry I of England, thusly William was a nephew of the Empress Maud and a cousin of King Stephen, the principal combatants of the English Anarchy period.<br>
<br>
In October 1141, William looked after the baronial estates, when his father fell into the hands of partisans at Winchester. His father was exchanged for King Stephen, and during his father's absence in Normandy in 1144 he served as Governor of Wareham. In 1147, he overthrew Henry de Tracy at Castle Cary. In 1154 he made an alliance with Roger de Clare, 3rd Earl of Hertford, by which they agreed to aid each other against all men except Henry II of England. He was lord of the manor of Glamorgan, as well as Caerleon, residing chiefly at Cardiff. It was there that in 1158 he and his wife and son were captured by Ivor the Little and carried away into the woods, where they were held as prisoners until the Earl redressed Ivor's grievances. In 1173 he took the King's part against his sons, but thereafter he appears to have fallen under suspicion, for the following year he submitted to the King, and in 1175 surrendered to him Bristol Castle. Because his only son and heir Robert died in 1166, Earl William made John, the younger son of King Henry II, heir to his earldom, in conformity with the King's promise that John should marry one of the Earl's daughters, if the Church would allow it, they being related in the third degree. Earl William was present in March 1177 when the King arbitrated between the Kings of Castile and Navarre, and in 1178, he witnessed Henry's charter to Waltham Abbey. But during the King's struggles with his sons, when he imprisoned a number of magnates of whose loyalty he was doubtful, Earl William was among them. He died on his birthday in 1183; his wife Hawise survived him.<br>
<br>
Since Earl William and Hawise's only son, Robert, predeceased his father, their three daughters became coheirs to the Gloucester inheritance. Mabel of Gloucester married Amaury V de Montfort, the Count of Evreux. Amice of Gloucester married Richard de Clare, 4th Earl of Hertford. Isabel, who became Countess of Gloucester, married Prince John, Earl of Gloucester, prior to him becoming king. He never allowed her to be crowned queen, and finally divorced her.<br>

Robert Fitz-Roger, who m. Margaret, only child and heiress of William de Cheney, by whom he acquired the Barony of Horsford, co. Norfolk, and had an only son, John. This Robert obtained a confirmation, upon the accession of King John, of the castle and manor of Warkworth, of the manor of Clavering, in Essex, and of the manor of Eure, in Buckinghamshire, to hold by the service of one knight's fee each. And in that monarch's reign he served the office of sheriff for Northumberland, Norfolk, and Suffolk; for each county thrice. In the conflict between John and the barons, this powerful person, although indebted to the crown for immense territorial possessions, took part in the first instance with the latter, but under the apprehension of confiscation, and the other visitations of royal vengeance, he was very soon induced to return to his allegiance. He was s. by his son, John Fitz-Robert. [Sir Bernard Burke, Dormant and Extinct Peerages, Burke's Peerage, Ltd., London, 1883, p. 121, Clavering, Barons Clavering]<br>

Warwick, and having m. ?Mabel, daughter and (in her issue) heir of William Fitz Richard, a man of huge estates in Cornwall, was created about Apr 1141, Earl of Cornwall, probably by the Empress Maud, but the title was fully recognised subsequently by King Stephen. He was a witness to the compromise between Stephen and Henry, 1153. Sheriff of Devon, 1173-75. He was in command, ex parte Regis, Oct 1173, against the rebellious Barons. He d. spm legit, at Chertsey, Surrey, 1 July 1175, and was buried in the Abbey of Reading, when the Earldom reverted to the Crown. [Complete Peerage, III:429 as corrected by XIV:207]<br>

Miles FITZWALTER
<p>
<a name ="I004660"><b>[I004660]</b></a><br />
From Wikipedia, 12 June 2006:<br>
<br>
Miles de Gloucester, 1st Earl of Hereford, lord of Brecknock (1100 - 24 December 1143), was the son of Walter of Gloucester, who appears as sheriff of that county between 1104 and 1121.<br>
<br>
Milo succeeded his father about the latter year. He was high in the service of Henry I between 1130 and 1135, and combined the office of sheriff with that of local justiciar for Gloucestershire. After the death of Henry he declared for Stephen, at whose court he appears as constable in 1136. But in 1139, when the empress Matilda appeared in England, he declared for her, and placed the city of Gloucester at her disposal; he was further distinguished by sacking the royalist city of Worcester and reducing the county of Hereford.<br>
<br>
In 1141, at Matilda's coronation, he was rewarded with the earldom of Hereford. He remained loyal to the empress after her defeat at Winchester. John of Salisbury classes him with Geoffrey de Mandeville and others who were non tam comites regni quam hostes publici. The charge is justified by his public policy; but the materials for appraising his personal character do not exist.<br>
[edit]<br>
<br>
Family and children<br>
