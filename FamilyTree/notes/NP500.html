Olaf Cuarajn SITRICSSON
<p>
<a name ="I009752"><b>[I009752]</b></a><br />
Olaf SIHTRICSON, by name (in sagas) OLAF THE RED, or OLAFCUARAN, Olaf also spelled ANLAF (d. 981?, Iona?), king of the Danish kingdoms of Northumbria and of Dublin. He was the son of Sihtric, king of Deira, and was related to the English king Aethelstan. When Sihtric died about 927 Aethelstan annexed Deira, and Olaf took refuge in Scotland and in Ireland until937, when he was one of the leaders of the formidable league of princes that was destroyed by Aethelstan at the famous Battle of Brunanburh. Again he sought a homeamong his kinsfolk in Ireland, but just after Aethelstan's death in 940he or Olaf Guthfrithson was recalled to England by the Northumbrians.  Both crossed over, and in 941 the new English king, Edmund, gave up Deira to the former. The peace between the English and Danes did not, however, last long. Wulfstan, archbishop of York, sided with Olaf; but in944 Olaf was driven from Northumbria by Edmund, and crossing to Ireland, Olaf ruled over the Danish kingdom of Dublin. From 949 to 952 he was again king of Northumbria, until he was expelled once more (this time by Erik Bloodaxe), and he passed the remainder of his active life in warfare in Ireland. But in 980 his dominion was shattered by the defeat of the Danes at the Battle of Tara. He went to Iona, where he died probably in981, although one dubious account says he was in Dublin in 994.[Britannica CD '97]<br>
