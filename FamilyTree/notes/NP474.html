From Wikipedia<br>
<br>
Henry I, the Fowler (German: Heinrich der Vogler) (876 - July 2, 936), was Duke of Saxony from 912 and king of the Germans from 919 until his death in 936. First of the Ottonian Dynasty of German kings and emperors, he is generally considered to be the founder and first king of the medieval German Empire, known until then as the East Franconian Kingdom. An avid hunter, he obtained the epithet "the Fowler" because he was allegedly fixing his birding nets when messengers arrived to inform him that he was to be king.<br>
<br>
Henry was the son of Otto the Illustrious, duke of Saxony, and his wife Hedwiga, a great-granddaughter of Charlemagne. In 906 he married Hatheburg, daughter of the Saxon count Erwin, but divorced her in 909 after she had given birth to his son Thankmar. Later that year he married Matilda of Ringelheim, daughter of Dietrich, count in western Saxony (Westfalia). Matilda bore him three sons and two daughters and founded many religious institutions, including the abbey of Quedlinburg where Henry is buried, and was later canonized.<br>
<br>
Henry became duke of Saxony upon his father's death in 912 and, an able ruler, continued to strengthen Saxony, frequently in conflict with his neighbors to the South, the dukes of Franconia.<br>
<br>
In 918 king Conrad I of the East-Franconian Empire, and duke of Franconia, died and recommended Henry as his successor as king, despite the fact that they had been at odds with each other from 912 to 915 over the title to lands in Thuringia. Conrad's choice was conveyed by duke Eberhard III of Franconia, Conrad's bother and heir, to the assembled Franconian and Saxon nobles at the Reichstag of Fritzlar in 919, which duly elected Henry to be king. Henry however was not anointed, the only king of his time not to undergo that rite. Duke Burkhard I of Swabia soon swore fealty to the new king, but duke Arnulf of Bavaria did not submit until Henry invaded Bavaria in 921 and Arnulf swore fealty to him.<br>
<br>
Henry regarded the kingdom as a confederation of tribal duchies rather than a feudal kingdom and himself as primus inter pares. Rather than seeking to administer the empire through counts, as Charlemagne had done and his successors had attempted, Henry allowed the dukes of Franconia, Swabia and Bavaria to maintain complete internal control of their holdings. In 925, he defeated Giselbert, duke of Lotharingia (Lorraine), and brought that realm, which had been lost in 910, back into the German kingdom as the fifth tribal duchy (the others being Saxony, Franconia, Swabia, and Bavaria), but allowing Giselbert to remain in power and marrying his daughter Gerberga to his new vassal in 928.<br>
<br>
Henry was a very able military leader. Germany had been repeatedly raided by the Magyars (Hungarians), and in 924 Henry paid them a tribute to secure a ten-year truce so that he could fortify towns and train a new elite cavalry force. With his new army, he conquered the Havelli and the Daleminzi in 928 and put down a rebellion in Bohemia in 929. When the Magyars began raiding again, he led an army of all German tribes to victory over them at the battle of Riade in 933, stopping one of their advances into Germany. He also pacified territories to the north, where the Danes had harried the Frisians off to the sea. The monk and historian Widukind of Corvey in his Rex gestae Saxonicae reports that the Danes were subjects of Henry the Fowler. Henry incorporated territories held by the Wends, who together with the Danes had attacked Germany, into his kingdom and also conquered Schleswig in 934.<br>
<br>
When Henry died on 2 July 936, all German tribes were united in a single kingdom. Henry I is therefore considered the first German king and the founder of the eventual Holy Roman Empire of the German Nation (Heiliges RÃ¶misches Reich Deutscher Nation).<br>
<br>
His son Otto succeeded him as Emperor Otto I ("the Great"). His second son, Henry, became duke of Bavaria. A third son, Brun (or Bruno), became archbishop of Cologne. His son from his first marriage, Thankmar, rebelled against his half-brother Otto and was killed in battle in 936. His daughter Gerberga married Duke Giselbert of Lorraine and subsequently King Louis IV of France. His youngest daughter Hedwige of Saxony married Duke (Hugh the Great) of France and was the mother of Hugh Capet, the first Capetian king of France.<br>
</p>
Liudolf of SAXONY
<p>
<a name ="I004710"><b>[I004710]</b></a><br />
Liudolf (died 12 March 864 or 866) was a Saxon count; later authors called him duke of the Eastern Saxons. He was also named as count of Eastphalia. Liudolf had possessions in eastern Saxony, and was involved in wars against Normans and Slavs. The Liudolfing House, also known as the Ottonian House, is named after him; he is its oldest known member.<br>
<br>
Liudolf married Oda, daughter of a Frankish prince named Billung and his wife Aeda. Oda died on 17 May 913, supposedly at the age of 107. By marrying a Frankish nobleman's daughter, Liudolf followed suggestions set forth by Charlemagne about ensuring the integrity of the Frankish Kingdom through marriage.<br>
<br>
In 845/846, Liudolf and his wife traveled to Rome in order to ask Pope Sergius II for support for the founding of a nunnery. The nunnery was founded in Brunshausen around 852, and it was moved to nearby Gandersheim in 881. Liudolf's daughter Hathumod became its first abbess. Liudolf is buried in Brunshausen; his sons Brun and Otto apparently inherited his property.<br>
</p>
Magnus of SAXONY
<p>
<a name ="I008066"><b>[I008066]</b></a><br />
Magnus, Duke of Saxony, was the last member of the House of Billung. From 1070 on, he was involved in the war between Saxon noblemen and the Salian king Henry IV.<br>
</p>
Otto I of SAXONY
<p>
<a name ="I007871"><b>[I007871]</b></a><br />
From Wikipedia<br>
<br>
Otto I the Great (November 23, 912 - May 7, 973), son of Henry I the Fowler, king of the Germans, and Matilda of Ringelheim, was Duke of Saxony, King of the Germans and arguably the first Holy Roman Emperor. (While Charlemagne had been crowned emperor in 800, his empire was divided amongst his grandsons, and following the assassination of Berengar of Friuli in 924, the imperial title lay vacant for nearly forty years.)<br>
<br>
Early reign<br>
Otto succeeded his father as king of the Germans in 936. He arranged for his coronation to be held in Charlemagne's former capital, Aachen. According to the Saxon historian Widukind of Corvey, at his coronation banquet he had the four other dukes of the empire, those of Franconia, Swabia, Bavaria and Lorraine, act as his personal attendants, Arnulf I of Bavaria as marshall (or stablemaster), Herman of Swabia as cupbearer (lat. pincerna or buticularius), Eberhard III of Franconia as steward, and Gilbert of Lorraine as chamberlain.<br>
<br>
In 938, a rich vein of silver was discovered at the Rammelsberg in Saxony. This ore body would provide much of Europe's silver, copper, and lead for the next two hundred years, and this mineral wealth helped fund Otto's activities throughout his reign.<br>
<br>
Otto's early reign was marked by a series of ducal revolts. In 938, Eberhard, the new duke of Bavaria, refused to pay Otto homage. When Otto deposed him in favor of his uncle Berthold, Eberhard of Franconia revolted, together with several of the Saxon nobility, who tried to depose Otto in favor of his elder half-brother Thankmar (son of Henry's first wife Hatheburg). While Otto was able to defeat and kill Thankmar in 936, the revolt continued the next year when Gilbert, the Duke of Lorraine, swore fealty to King Louis IV of France. Meanwhile, Otto's younger brother Henry conspired with the Archbishop of Mainz to assassinate him. The rebellion ended in 939 with Otto's victory at the Battle of Andernach, where the dukes of Franconia and Lorraine both perished. Henry fled to France, and Otto responded by supporting Hugh the Great in his campaign against the French crown, but in 941 Otto and Henry were reconciled through the efforts of their mother, and the next year Otto withdrew from France after Louis recognized his suzerainty over Lorraine.<br>
<br>
To prevent further revolts, Otto arranged for all the important duchies in the German kingdom to be held by close family members. He kept the now-vacant duchy of Franconia as a personal fiefdom, while in 944 he bestowed the duchy of Lorraine upon Conrad the Red, who later married his daughter Liutgard. Meanwhile, he arranged for his son Liutdolf to marry Ida, the daughter of Duke Herman of Swabia, and to inherit that duchy when Herman died in 947. A similar arrangement led to Henry becoming duke of Bavaria in 949.<br>
<br>
Campaigns in Italy and eastern Europe<br>
Meanwhile, Italy had fallen into political chaos. On the death (950), possibly by poisoning, of Lothair of Arles, the Italian throne was inherited by a woman, Adelaide of Italy, the respective daughter, daughter-in-law, and widow of the last three kings of Italy. A local noble, Berengar of Ivrea, declared himself king of Italy, abducted Adelaide, and tried to legitimize his reign by forcing Adelaide to marry his son Adalbert. However, Adelaide escaped to Canossa and requested German intervention. Ludolf and Henry independently invaded northern Italy to take advantage of the situation, but in 951 Otto frustrated his son's and his brother's ambitions by invading Italy himself, forcing Berengar to swear fealty, and then, having been widowed since 946, marrying Adelaide.<br>
<br>
This marriage triggered another revolt. When Adelaide bore a son, Ludolf feared for his position as Otto's heir, and in 953 he rebelled in league with Conrad the Red and the Archbishop of Mainz. While Otto was initially successful in reasserting his authority in Lorraine, he was captured while attacking Mainz, and by the next year, the rebellion had spread throughout the kingdom. However, Conrad and Ludolf erred by allying themselves with the Magyars. Extensive Magyar raids in southern Germany in 954 compelled the German nobles to reunite, and at the Diet of Auerstadt, Conrad and Ludolf were stripped of their titles and Otto's authority reestablished. In 955, Otto cemented his authority by routing Magyar forces at the Battle of Lechfeld.<br>
<br>
The Ottonian system<br>
A key part of Otto's domestic policy lay in strengthening ecclesiastical authorities, chiefly bishops and abbots, at the expense of the secular nobility. Otto endowed the bishoprics and abbeys with large tracts of land, over which secular authorities had neither the power of taxation nor legal jurisdiction. In an extreme example, when Conrad the Red was stripped of his ducal title in Lorraine, he appointed his brother Bruno, already the Archbishop of Cologne as the new duke of Lorraine. In the lands Otto conquered from the Wends and other Slavic peoples on his eastern borders, he founded several new bishoprics.<br>
<br>
Because Otto personally appointed the bishops, these reforms strengthened his central authority, and the upper ranks of the German church functioned in some respect as an arm of the imperial bureaucracy. Conflict between Otto's successors and the growing power of the Papacy over these powerful bishoprics would, however, eventually lead to the Investiture Conflict and the undoing of central authority in Germany.<br>
<br>
Imperial title<br>
In the early 960s, Italy was again in political turmoil, and when Berengar occupied the northern Papal States, Pope John XII asked Otto for assistance. Otto returned to Italy and on February 2, 962, the pope crowned him emperor. (Translatio imperii.) Ten days later, the pope and emperor ratified the Diploma Ottonianum, in which the emperor became the guarantor of the independence of the papal states. After Otto left Rome and reconquered the Papal States from Berengar, however, John became fearful of the emperor's power and sent envoys to the Magyars and the Byzantine Empire to form a league against Otto. In November of 963, Otto returned to Rome and convened a synod of bishops that deposed John and crowned Leo VIII, at that time a layman, as pope. When the emperor left Rome, however, civil war broke out in the city between those who supported the emperor and those who supported John. John returned to power amidst great bloodshed and excommunicated those who had deposed him, forcing Otto to return to Rome a third time in July of 964 to depose Pope Benedict V (John having died two months earlier). On this occasion, Otto extracted from the citizens of Rome a promise not to elect a pope without imperial approval.<br>
<br>
Otto unsuccessfully campaigned in southern Italy on several occasions from 966-972, although in 972, the Byzantine emperor John I Tzimisces recognized Otto's imperial title and agreed to a marriage between Otto's son and heir Otto II and his niece Theophano.<br>
<br>
After his death in 973 he was buried next to his first wife Editha of Wessex in the Cathedral of Magdeburg.<br>
</p>
Otto of SAXONY
<p>
<a name ="I004708"><b>[I004708]</b></a><br />
Otto or Oddo (died 30 November 912) was a Saxon nobleman; by later authors, he is often called Otto the Illustrious. The younger son of Liudolf, Duke of Saxony and his wife Oda, Otto presumably became duke of Saxony shortly before his death, but no details are known.<br>
<br>
According to Widukind of Corvey, Otto was offered the kingship of the East Franconian Kingdom in 911 and did not accept it, but the truthfulness of this report is considered doubtful. Otto's wife was Hathui, daughter of Henry, Duke of Austria. He is named as count of South Thuringia in 888, and as count of the Eichsfeld in 908; he was also lay abbot of the Monastery of Hersfeld. Otto is buried in the monastery church of Gandersheim. His son Henry, later to be King Henry the Fowler, succeeded him as duke of Saxony.<br>

William Patrick SCANLON
<p>
<a name ="I027051"><b>[I027051]</b></a><br />
RAPID CITY - William Patrick "Bill" Scanlon, 95, passed away on 12 December 2020.<br>
He was born to Patrick Phillip and Olga Isoline (Boog) Scanlon on 07 February 1925 in Bassein, Burma (now Myanmar). He had an older brother, Dennis Patrick, and a younger brother, Douglas (who died at age two). His mother and father divorced before he was five years old. He attended a Jesuit boarding school in Rangoon, Myanmar, until he was around 12 years old. His love of numbers and math started at this school, and he developed the talent of mentally summing long lists of numbers and solving algebraic equations - no paper, pencil, or calculator required. After 1938, civil unrest due to the overthrow of English rule and the Japanese invasion of Myanmar during World War II disrupted his education. His immediate family, including his brother, his mother, and many more of his extended family, emigrated from Bassein, Myanmar in 1948 and moved to London, England.<br>
Bill lived in London for seven years, earning his certification in accounting, but eventually decided to emigrate again, this time to the United States. Between 1957 and 1961, he married and divorced. Bill moved to Denver, Colorado around 1960. There he met Ruth Ann Nolan (the love of his life), a coworker who originally was from Minneapolis, Minnesota, and they married on 20 October 1962. Bill and Ruth had four children: Patricia Lee, Kathleen Ann, Dennis Phillip and William John (who are twins).<br>
The family moved to Rapid City, South Dakota on 07 June 1972, where Bill obtained an accounting position at Northwestern Engineering. Bill and Ruth lived in Rapid City the rest of their lives. In 1973, he became the CEO of the South Dakota Cement Plant, a position he held for nine years. He ended his career at Summit, Inc., beginning in 1982 until he retired in 2016 at the age of 91.<br>
Bill loved golfing in the Black Hills and was a fixture at both Meadowbrook Golf Course and the Executive Golf Course until 2018. He had a wide span of friends and acquaintances: coworkers and peers in the construction industry, the folks who took his daily breakfast order at the Millstone Family Restaurant, his fellow Catholics at Blessed Sacrament Church, Rotarians, his sons' Boy Scout Troop leaders with whom he volunteered in the 1970s and '80s, and the barbershop quartet with which he briefly sang baritone in the 1980s.<br>
Traveling was one of Bill's passions - besides traveling extensively within the United States, he and Ruth traveled internationally to Canada, England and Myanmar several times, and also visited Australia. And he didn't only reside in the Black Hills, he adored the area for its natural beauty. Day trips to area lakes and through the Hills with his daughter Kathi gave him great joy in the past few years.<br>
Bill was predeceased by his parents, his brothers, and his wife, Ruth (27 December 2016). He is survived by his four children: Pat Kline in Colorado, Kathi Hawley (Mark Antrim) in Wyoming, Dennis (Maureen) Scanlon in Arizona, and Will (Betty) Scanlon in Illinois; nine grandchildren, Amanda, Kellan, Ty, Zachary, Paul, Nathan, Terry, Rebecca, and Kelly (from oldest to youngest); a great-grandson, Colt (on the way this month); numerous nephews and nieces; and a multitude of friends.<br>
A private funeral mass will be held at Blessed Sacrament Catholic Church.<br>
If you would care to share a memory or funny story about Bill, we would love to hear it. Please email it to Pat Kline at aquamom63@@gmail.com. She will compile them and share them with her siblings.<br>

Erma Mae SCARR
<p>
<a name ="I041024"><b>[I041024]</b></a><br />
Erma Mooberry, 80, of Davenport, passed away on Sunday, October 25 in Davenport. Funeral services celebrating her life will be at 11:00 am Monday, November 2nd at Weerts Funeral Home, Kimberly at Jersey Ridge Road, Davenport. Burial will follow at the National Cemetary, Rock Island Arsenal. Visitation will be Monday at the funeral home from 9:30-11:00 preceding the funeral service.
