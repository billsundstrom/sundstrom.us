Julia Hypatia ORTH
<p>
<a name ="I035349"><b>[I035349]</b></a><br />
Julia Hypatia Orth, 24, was killed instantly in a car accident on I-70 near Boonville, MO, on July 11, 2006. <br>
She was a brilliant young woman of incredible talent and enthusiasm. Homeschooled as a teenager in Cedar Hill, MO, she considered learning a lifelong pursuit, and never stopped trying or discovering new things. She was an avid reader, writer, drawer, painter, knitter, swimmer, runner, juggler, musician, and computer programmer, just to name a few. She loved animals, starting with the pets she kept as a child (including chickens, cats, and a border collie she trained herself), and continuing with the dolphins she studied at New College of Florida, where she received a bachelor's degree in biopsychology. It was her intention to become a research scientist in animal cognition, behavior, and communication, to which end she was about to begin graduate studies leading to a PhD at the University of Tennessee. She touched many lives both personally and through her work, and leaves behind a network of friends and admirers all around the world. She was passionate about environmental issues, and worked tirelessly to cultivate greener habits in herself and all who knew her. For anyone who could spare just a few dollars or a couple minutes of their time, she made the following suggestions, any one of which would ease the burden on what she saw as a beautiful planet in need of care: <br>
*Replace an incandescent light bulb with a fluorescent, or even better, an LED bulb. <br>
*Walk some place you normally drive. <br>
*Buy carbon offset credits for long car or plane trips (http://www.carbonfund.org/). <br>
*Plant a tree. <br>
*Ask your mayor to join the U.S. Mayor's Climate Protection Agreement, or thank them if they already have (http://www.ci.seattle.wa.us/mayor/climate/default.htm#how). <br>
*Tell your representatives you support Rep. Henry Waxman's Safe Climate Act (http://www.henrywaxman.house.gov/waxman/safeclimate/index.htm).<br>
*Talk to your friends. <br>
Julia's was not a message of doom, but one of gentle and hopeful insistence that even the largest problems are surmountable if everyone contributes just a little. She did her part, and had faith that others would begin to follow the example she set. <br>
She was a former member of the Weavers' Guild of St. Louis and continued her weaving, spinning, knitting and natural dyeing while she lived in Sarasota, Florida and Portland, Oregon. She was also a member of the St. Louis Homeschool Network and was previously featured in the Meramec Journal and the St. Louis Post-Dispatch when she became a National Merit Scholar in 1999.Services: At a future date there will be a celebration of her life in Port Townsend, Washington and Sarasota, Florida. <br>
Julia was survived by her beloved fiance, Nicholas Blanchard-Wright, Port Townsend, WA; her parents, Robert and Anne Orth and brother, Michael R. Orth, all of Gerald, MO; other relatives and many friends. <br>
The family was served by Oltmann Funeral Home, Washington, MO. <br>

<p>
<a name ="I035350"><b>[I035350]</b></a><br />
Michael R. Orth, Gerald, MO, is a junior, and is pursuing a degree in aerospace engineering. Through his hard work and determination as a Provost Scholar, Michael has maintained a cumulative GPA above 3.6;in recognition of his accomplishments, he has received Deanʼs Honors. Michael is treasurer of Caseʼs chapter of the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics (AIAA) and has been a member of the Design Build and Fly team both freshman and sophomore years, and will co-lead the team next year. He is also a member of the Case Kung-Fu Club. In his spare time he enjoys reading and spending time with his friends. Michael plans to pursue a masterʼs degree at Case through either the BS/MS program or the Master of Engineering and Management program offered by Weatherhead and then pursue a Ph.D. after working for a few years. Writing on behalf of the 2005-2006 Case Design Build and Fly competition team as one of the two new team co-leaders for next year, he says: Last year was a good year. We managed to complete our model aircraft in record time, allowing us our earliest ever successful flight test. We also received our highest ever score on the design report section of the competition, tying with one of MITʼs teams for 9th place. Our luck at the competition in Kansas was not good, however. A freak radio controller malfunction, and then the unexpected failure of our engine gearbox halted our two flight attempts. Our all carbon-fiber aircraft was the sturdiest plane there, and lighter than many of the others. It was a real disappointment not to see it fly. We are confident this year will be even better, as we are now much more experienced at working with the carbon fiber. Personally, and on behalf of the rest of the team, I wanted to write and offer our sincerest thanks to CAA for the financial support we received in the 05/06 season through the Case Fund competition. It was a great season. <br>
