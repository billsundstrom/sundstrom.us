<h2>Notes</h2>
Helen Jean TIBBITTS
<p>
<a name ="I098825"><b>[I098825]</b></a><br />
Statistician Who Defied The Odds.<br>
H. Jean Tibbets Thiebaux ʻ57<br>
March 17, 2015, in Woodbine, Maryland, of lung cancer.<br>
Jean was a statistician who served 16 years at the National Weather Service in the National Center for Environmental Prediction of the Department of Commerce. She also taught mathematics at a number of colleges, including Howard Community College, Montgomery College, Dalhousie University, and the University of Massachusetts, Amherst. She chaired the mathematics advisory committee of the Howard County (Maryland) public school system. While working at Dalhousie, she was awarded a seven-month contract to conduct a network design study for the Atmospheric Environment Service of Canada.<br>
Born in Michigan, Helen Jean Tibbets was the daughter of Helen Griffin Tibbets ʻ27, and the granddaughter of Prof. Frank Loxley Griffin [math 1911-56], who was appointed Reedʼs first professor in 1911. She attended high school in Rockville, Maryland, and when it came time to consider what college she would attend, Jean turned to American Men of Science, a publication about the leading men of science in the U.S. and Canada. She concluded that of the top 50 undergraduate institutions producing future leaders in science, Reed led the pack. Her father, concerned that she not just single out one school, asked her to apply a number of places, including Caltech.<br>
"Caltech didnʼt admit women," Jean remembered, "and they were bold in informing me of that fact. So I applied to just a couple of other places and, fortunately, Reed did accept me."<br>
She intended to pursue an engineering program, but after starting at Reed, Jean discovered she was more interested in mathematics. During her freshman year, she lived on the third floor of Kerr House, sharing her room with a pet rabbit named Harvey, until the dean of students, Ann Shepard ʻ23 [deanʼs office, 1926-1968] made her get rid of him. Jean developed a strong interest in the humanities and philosophy, and a lifelong affection for mountain climbing, rock climbing, and skiing.<br>
During her freshman year, Reed President Duncan S. Ballantine [1952-1954] resigned, and the Board of Trustees brought Jeanʼs grandfather, Frank Loxley Griffin back from retirement to be interim president [1954-1956].<br>
"He and my grandmother put an enormous amount of effort in their caring for Reed, putting it back on track," Jean remembered. But many students and faculty who had been dissatisfied with Ballantineʼs administration of the college, regarded Griffin as too old and conservative to take the lead, and it became awkward for Jean.<br>
"I would walk into a room where there was a very heated discussion of how the college was going to respond to this new administration, and the discussion would die," Jean remembered. "I was not admitted to the inner circles and it made me feel pretty lonely. I felt singularly out in the cold during that year, but I was very proud to see how my grandparents managed to get people reunited in following the founding principles of Reed College-and making it a healthy, forward-looking institution once again."<br>
Jean also recalled the impact of the McCarthy era at Reed. When a visiting aunt broached the topic of communism, Jean responded, "Do you think itʼs a bad thing?" Distressed, the aunt contacted Jeanʼs parents, warning them of Jeanʼs communist leanings.<br>
"I didnʼt have any communist leanings," Jean said. "I didnʼt even know what it meant as an economic or social system, but I was wanting to learn. It was characteristic of those times that peopleʼs fear was associated with the word, not with the ideas, and it had a very big impact on how people regarded Reed College, being an institution of questing."<br>
"My first math course was taught by Prof. Jack Dudman ʻ42 [mathematics 1953-85], who had just come back to Reed," Jean said. "He had been a student of my grandfather. It was the last year when the introductory math course was taught from my grandfatherʼs book, and taught by someone who had studied with him. It was as if my grandfather was talking to me, and the whole thing made sense-an introduction to mathematical analysis. Thatʼs probably why I continued to pursue the math courses."<br>
She also had a special regard for Prof. Joe Roberts [mathematics 1952-2014], whom the students referred to as "Mighty Joe Roberts," because he was large and lanky, and strode down from Woodstock where he lived, to his morning classes.<br>
"He had trouble scheduling a particular class because there was a conflict with every possible time during the regular day," she remembered. "So, he decided that we were going to meet at 6:30 in the morning. It wasnʼt very long before the size of the class was down to a number of students who could agree on a more popular time, which I thought was a brilliant solution to the problem. I had trouble doing anything before having coffee and breakfast, but going to Joe Robertsʼ class was more important than my first cup of coffee. So, I was one of the finalists in that class!"<br>
One of the few women in the mathematics department, for the most part Jean felt encouraged by professors who wanted to share their knowledge and love for a subject, regardless of a studentʼs gender. But one new mathematics instructor who dated Jean questioned her math trajectory. "Why do you want to do that?" he asked. "Youʼre just going to get married and raise kids." Jean decided she was interested neither in him nor in what he thought.<br>
In the mid '50s the campus coffee shop was the cultural hub. Jean recalled that a tea bag cost five cents, but a cup of hot water was free and you could get five cups of tea from one bag. "You would gather in a booth with friends and people whose ideas you wanted to access and share a teabag around," Jean said. "It seemed like a pretty good use of an hour, and for me, it was a haven of ideas."<br>
After graduating, she married Eric Terzaghi '58. When he was accepted as a graduate student at the University of Oregon, Jean began working part time for a professor and taking biology classes. She got a masterʼs degree with a major in mathematics and a minor in biology, writing her thesis about statistical theory in connection with genetics. A teaching assistantship followed at Stanford University. By the time Jean got her PhD, she was divorced, had married Martial Thiebaux, and had her first child. She got a part-time job teaching at the University of Connecticut, turned her thesis into published papers, and launched her post-PhD career. In 1985, she and Martial divorced, after having five children: Tamara, Michael, Aaron, Raananna, and Laadan.<br>
Intellectual curiosity-especially about issues involving the theory of evolution and the theory of inheritance-determined her career path. But Jean admitted that many of the driving forces that led to a successful career as an educator and statistician were instilled at Reed: "Keep your head down and work hard. Define what it is that is important to do. Figure out how to do it and then do it. And come up complete."<br>
"The word that I would use to characterize myself and what drives me, is restlessness," she said. "That is a characteristic of Reed: ʻDon't just accept what somebody says. Go and find out if it's true. Don't accept that somebody says itʼs not possible. If itʼs something thatʼs important to do, go and do it."<br>
In 2007, Jean married Stephen Brown-Pearn, who survives her.<br>

Roy Clark TIBBITTS
<p>
<a name ="I098820"><b>[I098820]</b></a><br />
Clark Tibbitts, 82, an expert on the process of aging who designed and directed the first National Conference on Aging more than 30 years ago and became an aggressive promoter of gerontology as a major government responsibility, died Oct. 11 at a hospital in Dover, N.H., after a heart attack.<br>
Mr. Tibbitts, a resident of Rockville, was visiting a daughter when he was stricken.<br>
He retired in 1983 from the staff of the commissioner on aging within the Department of Health and Human Services after a 34-year government career devoted entirely to problems and issues involving the aging. At the time of his retirement he was a specialist in international issues involving aging.<br>
John M. Cornman, executive director of the Gerontological Society of America, said Mr. Tibbitts "was among the first to recognize the impacts the growing number of older people would have on our society. He was instrumental in launching important educational research and service programs responding to the needs of older people."<br>
Mr. Tibbitts coined the phrase "social gerontology," and was one of the earliest advocates of the concept that specific programs for the elderly should be viewed as a package instead of a collection of unrelated health, housing or income supplement programs.<br>
He came to Washington as a specialist on aging in 1949 to join the old Federal Security Agency, the predecessor of the Department of Health, Education and Welfare, which was subsequently replaced by the Department of Health and Human Services. He was chairman of the FSA committee on aging and geriatrics.<br>
Before coming to Washington he had been director of the Institute for Human Adjustment at the University of Michigan for 12 years, and in that capacity he organized the first general conference on aging in the United States in 1947. In 1950 he directed the first National Conference on Aging, the predecessor of the White House Conferences on Aging.<br>
A native of Chicago, Mr. Tibbitts graduated from the old Lewis Institute, which is now the Illinois Institute of Technology, and he did graduate study at the University of Chicago. During the early 1930s he worked for the old Federal Emergency Relief Administration and the Works Progress Administration in Washington, then transferred to Detroit where he directed a nationwide health survey for the WPA.<br>
Mr. Tibbitts, the author of several books and articles on the aging process, was instrumental in establishing the government publication Aging, and he also helped organize the International Association of Gerontology.<br>
He is survived by his wife, Helen Griffin Tibbitts, of Rockville; two daughters, Helen Jean Thiebaux of Fort Washington and Ann Tibbitts Schulz of Newton, Mass; a stepdaughter, Alice Mailhot of Ypsilanti, Mich.; 12 grandchildren and two great-grandchildren.<br>

Lydia Christine TIEDE
<p>
<a name ="I079937"><b>[I079937]</b></a><br />
Lydia Christine Mattheis was born on a farm near Parkston, SD on Jul. 28, 1901, the daughter of Nathaniel G. and Sophia (Schimke) Tiede. She attended rural school and grew to womanhood there.<br>
On Mar. 15, 1925, she was united in marriage to Richard A. Mattheis at Zion Congregational Church in Parkston, SD.<br>
Following their marriage, they lived in Parkston and moved to Platte in 1930. On Feb. 28, 1941, they moved to Lennox where she had since lived. Her husband preceded her in death on Dec. 19, 1977, ending a marriage partnership of over 52 years.<br>
Besides her parents and husband, she was preceded in death by one granddaughter, Loreen Mattheis; one brother, Samuel Tiede; and one sister, Diana Radach.<br>
Having been in declining health and following a recent illness of two months, Lydia died at the Foundation Hospice Cottage in Sioux Falls on Sunday evening, Jul. 21, 1996. She attained the age of 94 years, eleven months and 23 days.<br>
Grateful for having shared her life are her four children and their spouses: Rolland and Colleen Mattheis of Lennox, Kenneth and JoAnn Mattheis, Delores and Chet Whitney, and Gladys and Elroy Musch, all of Sioux Falls; eight grandchildren; 12 great-grandchildren; two great-great-grandchildren; one sister, Esther Bechtle of Minneapolis, MN. <br>

Robert H. TIENKEN
<p>
<a name ="I092674"><b>[I092674]</b></a><br />
Robert H. (Bob) Tienken was born May 23, 1919 in Lindsay, Ca. and passed away at his home in Lindsay on May 12, 2009 after a brief illness. Bob was the youngest of three sons of Albert & Mae Tienken. He lived almost his entire life in Lindsay and was always a strong advocate of his hometown. Bob graduated from Lindsay High School and then went on to Fresno State College. He dated Barbara Sanborn while at college. During his senior year he entered military service but continued his romance with Barbara through letters and occasional phone calls. They were married October 21, 1942 while Bob was home on leave. The newlyweds spent 6 months traveling the USA while Bob went from place to place training for overseas duty with the Army Air Corp. He shipped out in May 1943, and spent the next 2 1/2 years at the 100th Bomb Group base in Thorpe Abbots, England. Bob returned in late 1945, finished up at Fresno State, worked for McMahon's Furniture for a short time, then moved back to Lindsay entering the insurance and real estate business. Bob knew how to set goals, work hard, and have fun. He did those things while building his business and raising his family. Many hours were spent with his sons hunting, fishing, and doing projects in Camp Nelson and around the house. He always believed in giving back to the community , treating people fairly, and helping others when he could. He was one of the founders of Bank of the Sierra and was on the Board of Directors until his recent retirement. He was a lifelong businessman and a Realtor for nearly 60 years. Bob loved his family and was a wonderful encourager and role model for his 3 sons, 13 grandchildren, and 17 great grandchildren. He was pleased to have been able to help Lindsay grow with new housing subdivisions and other buildings over the years. He loved to assist the Cultural Arts Council, the Presbyterian Church, the City of Lindsay, Camp Nelson Conservancy, and the 100th Bomb Group Museum on his old base in England. Bob was especially grateful to have been able to help the extended day program for the junior high school in Lindsay and was humbled to have the Lindsay City Council establish the Tienken Academy. Bob's own words from a few months ago probably say it all best, "As I look back on my life I feel it has been good and satisfying and very blessed. I have discovered that if you try to make things a little bit better - with family, at church or the community, you are not just helping people, you are a happier person. I believe the secret to a fulfilling life is using your money and talents in a way that will serve one's country to the benefit of all." The family wishes to thank the doctors and staff of Sansum Clinic and Cottage Hospital in Santa Barbara, Hospice of Tulare County, and Comfort Keepers for their wonderful and compassionate care. Bob is survived by his wife Barbara, his son Jim and wife Carrie, his son Jeff and wife Patti, his son Brian and wife Kim, 13 grandchildren, and 19 great grandchildren. A memorial service will be held at the First Presbyterian Church, 351 E. Hermosa, Lindsay, CA 93247 at 10:30am on Monday, May 18, 2009.Remembrances may be made to the First Presbyterian Church at the above address, the Tienken Academy c/o McDermott Field House, P.O. Box 369, Lindsay, CA 93247 or the Lindsay Cultural Arts Council for the Museum, P.O. Box 223, Lindsay, CA 93247. Condolences may be sent to the family at www.myersfuneral.com. Arrangements are under the direction of Myers Funeral Service in Lindsay. <br>

Elizabeth TILDEN
<p>
<a name ="I005724"><b>[I005724]</b></a><br />
Elizabeth's surname has been given as Neil or Tilden/Tilton and in several cases, as Seldon. In the parish registers of Tenterden, Nathaniel Tilden's children are given, and there is no Elizabeth. Further, the William Bassett who arrived from Leyden as a widower may not have been this particular William Bassett. Charles Banks states that given the provisions of this William's will and his age at death in 1667, it seems very unlikely that the two Williams are one and the same. Years of erroneous attribution of Elizabeth as a daughter of either Nathaniel or Thomas Tilden make the confusion murkier, not clearer, and it may not be possible to sort out. What does appear to be true is that Ruth, daughter of William Bassett married John Sprague and their son married Lydia, LNU, and fathered Irene Sprague, who married, in Connecticut, Aaron Fish. What also appears to be true is that a William Bassett arrived abt 1621, and in 1623 was given a share for himself and for his wife Elizabeth, so whoever William was, he appears to have married shortly after his arrival. It seems likely, given the times and hardships, that he may have married a widow, but there's evidently no firm evidence of Elizabeth's surname.<br>

<a name ="I006130"><b>[I006130]</b></a><br />
He married Ellen Hubbard (1548-1547) after 13 November 1593 at Tenterden, Kent.<br>
