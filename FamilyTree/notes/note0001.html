From Wikipedia<br />
 <br />
Ivar Vidfamne. Ívarr inn v́ıđfađmi or Ivar Vidfamne was a semi-legendary king of Sweden c. 655- c.695, and according to the Heimskringla and the Hervarar saga also the king of Norway, Denmark, Saxony and parts of England. He began as king of Scania and conquered Sweden by defeating Ingjald Illråde. He is then said to have conquered all of Scandinavia and parts of England. Because of his harsh rule, many Swedes fled west and populated Wermelandia under its king Olof Trätälja. His last campaign was in Russia where he died, defeated by Odin in disguise. (Another source claims he took his life by drowning himself in the Gulf of Finland.)<br />
 <br />
His homeland was Scania, but according to the Heimskringla and the Sögubrot, he had to flee Scania when his uncle Gudröd had slain his father Halfdan the Mild. Snorri Sturluson, Historia Norwegiae, Hervarar saga and Upplendinga Konungum tell that Ivar conquered Sweden after Ingjald's suicide, and later returned to take Denmark.<br />
 <br />
According to Hversu Noregr byggdist, he was the son of Halfdan the Kind (also given as his father in the Heimskringla and the Hervarar saga), son of Harald the Old, son of Valdar, son of Roar (Hrođgar) of the house of Skjöldung (Scylding). According to Hversu, the Lay of Hyndla and Sögubrot, Ivar had a daughter named Aud.<br />
 <br />
Sögubrot relates that when Ivar was the king of Sweden, he gave his daughter Aud to king Rörek of Zealand, in spite of the fact that she wanted to marry Rörek's brother Helgi. Rörek and Aud had the son Harald Hildetand. Ivar made Rörek kill his brother Helgi, and after this, he attacked and killed Rörek. However, Aud arrived with the Zealand army and chased her father Ivar back to Sweden. The following year, Aud went to Gardariki with her son Harald and many powerful men and married its king Radbart. This was the opportunity for Ivar to conquer Zealand. However, when he learnt that his daughter had married without his permission, he marshalled a great leidang from Denmark and Sweden and went to Gardariki. He was very old at the time. However, when they had arrived at the borders of Radbart's kingdom, Karelia (Karjálabotnar), he threw himself overboard. Harald then returned to Scania to become its ruler. In the Lay of Hyndla, Ivar, Aud, Rörek and Harald appear. Radbart also appears, but there is no information about his relationship with them.<br />
 <br />
However, according to the Hervarar saga, his daughter was named Alfhild and she was married to Valdar whom Ivar made king of Denmark.<br />

TULLY -- Myrtha A. (Sedgwick) Gale, 98, of 93 Royalston Road, died lateSunday evening, November 13, 2011 at Quabbin Valley Healthcare in Athol,following an illness.<br />
Born on February 19, 1913 in Jaffrey, New Hampshire, she was a daughter of Louis and Lena Sedgwick, and grew up in Fitchburg, graduating from Fitchburg High School in 1931. She moved to Tully in 1932 at the age of 19 with her parents, coming from Fitchburg and has been involved in the community ever since.<br />
Myrtha was married to David M. Gale at the Community Church of North Orange and Tully when she was just 22 years old and had enjoyed 50 years of marriage at the time of David's death on October 15, 1984.<br />
For 53 Years, Myrtha served as the librarian of the Moore-Leland Library in North Orange. She first started at the former Gale Brooks School, where she also had been a substitute teacher. During her tenure at the library, she cherished her time with the school children who came over weekly for reading hour from Gale Brooks. During the summer, the library hosted a reading club with prizes and a party at the conclusion. Adults using the library were greeted warmly as the children and became a meeting place of the North Orange community. She and the late Rose Taylor worked together in unison helping the patrons find the latest novel or facts for term papers. Myrtha retired from the library in 1996.<br />
Myrtha also was a teacher's aide at the Tully School for grades 1-8, while her husband David was the janitor.<br />
Not only a member of the Community Church of North Orange and Tully, Myrtha took an active role in many of the church functions, including the monthly suppers, the annual church fair in August, and the Holly Fair in November.<br />
She made many baked treats and numerous pounds of fudge and found much enjoyment working with her sister in law and friend of over 68 years, the late Norma Johnson, in all these events together. Besides cooking and baking, Myrtha's involvement in the church ladies' Dorcas Society resulted in many hand crafted hats, mittens, blankets, and quilts which have been treasured by many families in the area.<br />
Myrtha was also a member of the North Orange Grange for 70 years, having served on many committees. She also belonged to the I Wunder What Club, Orange Women's Club, Jolly Circle, and the Western Mass Library Club.<br />
Not to be out done by her husband and son's involvement in fire service, Myrtha had been a member of the Orange Fire Department and Tully Fire Station Ladies' Auxiliary and helped provide refreshments to the firemen during major fires, the children's Christmas party, and the Memorial Day parade. Myrtha was also on the fire department's "red phone" system when fires were reported directly to the Tully station. She was proud to see the new Tully Fire Station completed in 2010, though bittersweet that the trucks would not be directly across from her home in Tully Center.<br />
In 2003, Myrtha celebrated her 90th birthday party at the Community Church with over 200 family and friends celebrating her remarkable life. Every Halloween, all the children would look forward to her homemade popcorn balls, which she shared with a few lucky adults as well. Myrtha's affection and kindness to all will be missed by everyone, but especially by her devoted family.<br />
Survivors include her son, C. David Gale and his wife, Pamela, of North Orange; a granddaughter, Jessica Gale-Tanner and her husband, Benjamin, of Tully; a great grandson, Cory Tanner of Tully; nephews, Wayne Johnson and his wife, Virginia, Ward Johnson, Donald Fuller and his wife, Joanne, and David M. (Jim) Sedgwick; nieces, Gayle Metevia and her husband Paul, Lynda and Kate Sedgwick, Susan Kivi and her husband John, and Mary Jo Hood and her husband Gerald; extended family and numerous friends.<br />
Besides her husband David, Myrtha was predeceased by her sisters, Arlene Small, Blanche Davis, and Dorothy Fuller; brothers, Merrill and Norman Sedgwick, sister in law Norma Johnson and brother in law Robert Gale.<br />
There are no calling hours.<br />
A Celebration of Life will be held on Sunday afternoon, November 20 , 2011 at 2:00 p.m. in the Community Church of North Orange and Tully, 48 Main Street, North Orange, with the Rev. Jean Thompson officiating.<br />

"...Samuel, the early emigrant from London who was among the first of thesettlers at Springfield, and again of Northampton"<br />
 <br />
Samuel was one of two first deacons at 1st Congregational at Springfield,part of the Winthrop Colony<br />
 <br />
 <br />
 <br />
 <br />
Among the first settlers of the Connecticut River Valley was DeaconSamuel Wright of Springfield, and subsequently of Northampton; a briefnotice of whom, and some of his descendants, is subjoined. That beautifulvalley of rich land was acquired from its savage occupants, by theEnglish settlers, through severe hardships, and many sanguinaryconflicts; and men less daring in adventure would scarcely haveundertaken its settlement; and men whose characteristics were of a lesspositive quality could not have succeeded. It is, therefore, but an actof duty, and a just tribute of affection to their memories, to rescue, ifpossible, their names from the perishing records of their time, and notonly to incorporate them with the annals of the present, but, as objectsof affectionate remembrance, inscribe them in our family memorials.<br />
Springfield was settled A.D. 1636; but the name of Samuel Wright firstappears in the town records Dec. 12, 1639, when he was a juryman. He wasa deacon of the first church at Springfield, and "he used to exhort thepeople and conduct the meetings on the sabbaths when there was nominister." He moved to Northampton, A.D. 1655, and was among the firstsettlers of that town, where he "died, Oct. 17, 1665, while sleeping inhis chair." He left property by will to his wife Margaret, and each ofhis children, except Helped. His widow Margaret "died A.D. 1681." DeaconWright appears to have been an intelligent and useful member of thechurch, and labored to promote its prosperity. He was, quite probably, aman of a very religious temperament, as he chiefly distinguished himselfin religious affairs.<br />
He was supposed to have been the son of Mr. Nathaniel Wright, of London,a merchant interest in the Winthrop Colony, (1630), who had descendedfrom John Wright, of Kelvedon.<br />
around 1625/1626 in England. Deacon Samuel was b. in England and D. Oct.17, 1665 in Northampton, Hampshire County, Massachusetts. Deacon SamuelWright was one of the first settlers of Springfield, Hampden County,Massachusetts and came to that place about 1636 in the company of WilliamPynchon, and others, from Eastern Massachusetts who were intent onsettling the area for its rich trade and fertile land. He removed up theConnecticut River to Northampton about 1656 or 1657. Deacon Samuel WrightSr. was a Puritan from England, who came to America, California.1636, andwas the ancestor of many of those in western Massachusetts. It is saidthat both his father's and grandfather's name was John, and that theylived at a place called Wrightsbridge, co. Essex, 40 miles East ofLondon. Upon first arriving in New England, he may have lived in sometown at the Bay, as did most of the early settlers, but soon removed toSpringfield with the Wm. Pynchon party. Springfield, originally called byits Indian name "Agawam," until 1640, was surrounded by tribes ofsavages. It was the only English settlement in Massachusetts west ofBoston and vicinity, and perhaps contained not over 10 or 15 familieswhen Deacon Samuel, and family, came and settled on what is now MainStreet, a little below where now stands the historic First Church. Thefirst record of his presence in the settlement comes in the first jurynote in the Agawam court records dated Nov. 14, 1639. This entry revealsthat he served on the Jury, hearing cases between John Woodcoke and JohnCable and between William Pynchon and Thomas Merricks. His fellow juristsincluded a number of the other original inhabitants of the town, HenrySmyth, Jehew Burr, Henry Gregory, John Searle and Samuell Hubbard. Here,also, in 1639, he is mentioned in the town records as having been calledupon as Deacon of what is one of the 1st churches organized in the statesto serve as minister to the flock, "exhorting the people until such timeas another could be got for the job". Dea. Samuel removed, in 1656, toNorthampton, where his son Samuel Jr. had preceeded him, and was one ofits selectmen that year. On Oct. 17, 1665, Deacon Samuel "died whilesleeping in his chair" according to a 1666 record of the event. DeaconSamuel Wright's Sr.'s parents are believed to be John Wright and MarthaCastell. John Wright, Esq. was an influential London barrister who servedas a clerk of the House of Commons, and who came to some note in 1612 dueto his authorizing signature being affixed to certain publications of theHouse of Commons that railed against fiscal and religious policies ofJames I. (See endnote below) If the connection to John Wright, Esq. istrue, then Dea. Samuel's paternal grandfather was Lord John Wright ofWrightsbridge, co., Essex, England, who was granted arms, June 6, 1590,by Elizabeth I, and was one of the Protestants in the House of Lords whosupported Elizabeth, and later James I, in their religious policies. TheDeacon's wife, Margaret was b. in E ngland and D. July 24, 1681 inNorthampton, Hampshire County, Massachusetts. Her parents are not knownfor sure. Deacon Samuel and Margaret had at least 8 children. They wereSamuel Jr. (m. Elizabeth Burt)), Margaret (m. #1 Thomas Bancroft; m. #2?Thomas Bliss?)), Hester (m. Samuel Marshfield)), Lydia (m. #1 LawrenceBliss; m. #2 John Norton; m. #3 John Lamb; m. #4 George Colton)), Mary(m. Jonathan Taylor)), James (m. Abigail Jess/Jese/Jesse)), Judah (m. #1Mercy "Mary" Burt; m. #2 Sarah Woodford)) and Helped (died in infancy)).(*Note-It is thought that Deacon Samuel and Margaret did not have adaughter Hannah but she may have been a niece. Because of the confusionmany researchers connected to her have Deacon Samuel Wright and Margaretas her parents.)(*Note- The Deacon's connection to this important EnglishPuritan family (Lord John Wright of Wrightsbridge co., Essex, England)has not been conclusively proven. However, it is currently a far betterproposal than previously speculated English parentage (eg. Nathaniel &Lydia (James) Wright, John Wright, Esq.'s younger brother)).<br />

Robert of Bellême, 3rd Earl of Shrewsbury (1052- after 1130) was anAnglo-Norman nobleman, and one of the most promiment figures in thecompetition for the succession to England and Normandy between the sonsof William the Conqueror.<br />
 <br />
He was the eldest son of Roger of Montgomery, 1st Earl of Shrewsbury and Mabel of Bellême.<br />
 <br />
Robert's first notable act, as a young man, was to take part in the 1077 revolt of the young Robert Curthose against William the Conqueror, an act he shared with many other Norman nobles of his generation. The rebellion was put down, and the participants pardoned. William did require that ducal garrisons be placed in the important baronial castles, which would make future rebellion much more difficult.<br />
 <br />
Robert's mother Mabel was killed in 1082, whereupon Robert inherited her property which stretched across the hilly border region between Normandy and Maine. It is due to this early inheritance that Robert has come be known as of Bellême rather than of Montgomery.<br />
 <br />
William the Conqueror died in 1087, and Robert's first act on hearing the news was to expel the ducal garrisons from his castles. Robert Curthose was the new duke of Normandy, but he was unable to keep order, and Robert of Bellême had a free hand to make war against his less powerful neighbors.<br />
 <br />
The next year in the Rebellion of 1088, Odo of Bayeux rebelled in an attempt to place Curthose on the English throne in place of William Rufus. At Curthose's request Robert went to England, where he joined in the rebels' defense of Rochester Castle. The rebels were permitted to leave after the surrender of the castle and failure of the rebellion.<br />
 <br />
Robert returned to Normandy. But Odo had preceded him, had gotten the ear of the duke, and conviced Curthose that Robert was a danger to the security of the duchy. Thus Robert was arrested and imprisoned upon his disembarkation. (The duke's younger brother Henry, who was on the same ship, was also arrested.)<br />
 <br />
Robert's father earl Roger came over from England, and, taking over his son's castles, defied Curthose. The duke captured several of the castles, but he soon tired of the matter and released Robert.<br />
 <br />
Once released, Robert returned to his wars and depredations against his neighbors in southern Normandy. He did help Curthose in putting down a revolt by the citizens of Rouen, but his motive seems to have been in large part to seize as many wealthy townspeople and their goods as possible. Curthose in turn subsequently helped Robert is some of his fights againsts his neighbors.<br />
 <br />
In 1094 one of Robert's most important castles, Domfront, was taken over by the duke's brother Henry, who never relinquished it and was to be an enemy of Robert for the rest of his life.<br />
 <br />
Later that year (1094) Robert's father earl Roger died. Robert's younger brother Hugh of Montgomery, 2nd Earl of Shrewsbury inherited the English lands and titles, while Robert inherited his father's Norman properties, which included good part of central and southern Normandy, in part adjacent to the Bellême territories he had already inherited from his mother.<br />
 <br />
In 1098 Robert's younger brother Hugh died, and Robert inherited the English properties that had been their father's, including the Rape of Arundel and the Earldom of Shrewsbury.<br />
 <br />
Robert was one of the great magnates who joined Robert Curthose's 1101 invasion of England, along with his brothers Roger the Poitevin and Arnulf of Montgomery and his nephew William of Mortain. This invasion, which aimed to depose Henry I, ended in the Treaty of Alton. The treaty called for amnesty for the participants but allowed traitors to be punished. Henry had a series of charges drawn up against Robert in 1102, and when Robert refused to answer for them, gathered his forces and besieged and captured Robert's English castles. Robert lost his English lands and titles (as did his brothers), was banished from England, and returned to Normandy.<br />
 <br />
He was one of Curthose's commanders at the Battle of Tinchebrai and by flight from the field avoided being captured as Curthose was. With Normandy now under Henry's rule, he submitted and was allowed to retain his Norman fiefs. But after various conspiracies and plans to free Curthose Robert was seized and imprisoned in 1112. He spent the rest of his life in prison; the exact date of his death is not known.<br />
 <br />
Robert married Agnes of Ponthieu, by whom he had one child, William Talvas, who via his mother inherited the county of Ponthieu.<br />
 <br />
Robert had a quick wit, was a good military leader and was perhaps the best castle designer of his generation, but had a terrible reputation as a cruel sadist.<br />

From Wikipedia<br />
 <br />
Adelasia of Moriana (fr. Adélaide de Maurienne) (1092 - November 18, 1154) was the daughter of Humbert II of Savoy and Gisela of Burgundy, and niece of Pope Callistus II, who once visited her court in France. Her father died in 1103, and her mother married Rainier of Montferrat as a second husband.<br />
 <br />
She became the second wife of Louis VI of France (1081-1137), whom she married on August 3, 1115. They had six children, the second of whom became Louis VII of France. She was reputed to be "ugly," but attentive and pious, and with Louis she had six sons and two daughters:<br />
   1. Philippe (1116-1131), not to be confused with his brother of the same name; died from a fall from a horse<br />
   2. Louis VII the Young (1120-1180), king of France.<br />
   3. Henri (1121-1175), bishop of Beauvais (1149-1161) and then of archbishop of Reims (1161-1175)<br />
   4. Hugues (c. 1123), died young<br />
   5. Robert I of Dreux (c. 1123-1188), called Robert the Great, count of Dreux (1137-1184), count of Perche<br />
   6. Constance (c. 1124-1180), married first (in 1140) Eustace IV of Boulogne, married second (in 1154) Raymond V of Toulouse<br />
   7. Philippe (c. 1125-1161), not to be confused with his elder brother; bishop of Paris<br />
   8. Pierre (c. 1125-c. 1182), married Elizabeth of Courtenay<br />
 <br />
Afer Louis VI's death, Adélaide did not immediately retire to conventual life, as did most widowed queens of the time. Instead she married Matthieu I of Montmorency, with whom she had one child. She remained active in the French court and in religious activities.<br />
 <br />
Adélaide is one of two queens in a legend related by William Dugdale. As the story goes, Queen Adélaide of France became enamoured of a young knight, William d'Albini, at a joust. But he was already engaged to Queen Adeliza of England and refused to become her lover. The jealous Adélaide lured him into the clutches of a hungry lion, but William ripped out the beast's tongue with his bare hands and thus killed it. This story is almost without a doubt apocryphal.<br />
 <br />
In 1153 she retired to the abbey of Montmartre, which she had founded with Louis VII. She died there on November 18, 1154.<br />

Blance [sic] Helen Buxton, born at Carlyle, Ill., January 24, 1874, wasthe second daughter of Harvey Parris Buxton and Eunice Josephine Buxton.<br />
She was graduated from the Illinois Woman's College, Jacksonville, in 1892, and took special work at the University of California within the last few years.<br />
In June, 1894, she was married to Henry Griffith Barnes and to this union were born two children, who still survive.<br />
In October 1912 she was married to A. L. Hunt of Olathe, Kas., who preceded her in death in December, 1918.<br />
Eighteen years of her life were spent in the education of the deaf, among whom she had many loyal and devoted friends. During her career as an educator she taught in the following state institutions for the deaf: Little Rock, Ark., Jacksonville, Fla., Jacksonville, Ill., Olathe, Kans., and Berkeley, Calif.<br />
During her life time Mrs. Hunt had the advantage of residing in many different cities in the United States. Her early girlhood was spent at Carlyle Ill. and in Jacksonville, Ill, where she received her education. Part of the early years of her married life were spent at St. Paul, Minn., and Olathe, Kans., was the scene of many happy years.<br />
Following Mr. Hunt's death she went to Oakland, Calif., where she spent four years with her mother, Mrs. E. J. B. Harris and her sister, Mrs. John N. Cooper. During this time she engaged in teaching in the California School for the Deaf at Berkeley, rising to an advanced position in her profession.<br />
In June 1924 she resigned her position in order to come to Illinois and be with her son during his senior year at the University of Illinois, and to visit her sister, Mrs. F. S. Brown at Divernon.<br />
Shortly after her arrival in Illinois she became very ill and a long tedious sojourn in St. Luke's hospital, Chicago, became necessary.<br />
After an operation in October, her condition was so serious that she was unable to leave the hospital until the seventh of December, when she was brought to the home of her sister, Mrs. F. S. Brown, in the care of the latter and a nurse.<br />
Here, in spite of the forebodings of several famous Chicago physicians her health improved rapidly, until she was sufficiently recovered to be able to keep house for her son in Urbana during the last semester of his senior year's work at the University of Illinois.<br />
To her was given the joy of being present at his graduation in June when he received the degree of Bachelor of Science, and she also shared in his triumphs in the athletic contests when he received a loving cup and other honors accorded the welterweight champion in wrestling and boxing.<br />
She came to Maple Hill the later part of June in order to be present at the wedding of her niece Miss Eunice Josephine Brown to Lewis Turner in July. Since that time her health failed rapidly. On August 10 her daughter and one grandchild, Mirian, arrived, fulfilling a final wish to see the baby, and she passed away Wednesday evening, September 2, surrounded by the loved ones for her family.<br />
In early childhood she became a member of the Methodist church, to which, she has been devoted all her life. She was a member of the Easter Star and the Woman's Relief Corps.<br />
Surviving her are one daughter, Helen Mae, now Mrs. R. E. Johnson of Napa, Calif., one son Harvey Buxton Barnes of Urbana; two grandchildren, Raymond Edgar Johnson and Helen Miriam Johnson; her mother, Mrs. E. J. B. Harris of Oakland, Calif., three half brother, Paul W. Buxton of Fayetteville, Ark.; one brother, Edwin W. Buxton, Martinez, Calif.; one step brother, Dr. Ne. E. Harris; four step sisters, Miss Eula Harris, Mrs. Alma Harris-Hills, all of California; Mrs. Lucille Harris Orton of Lincoln, Ill.; and Mrs. Catherine Harris-Parker of Garden City, N. Y.<br />
A short service was held at the home of Mr. and Mrs. F. S. Brown in charge of Rev. Scroggs, pastor of the First Presbyterian church in Divernon. The body was brought to Olathe and the funeral service held at the Methodist church at 3 p.m. Friday.<br />

William Malet, of Granville, Normandy; also held lands in Lincs before1066 (possibly by virtue of his mother's putative status ofEnglishwoman); granted the feudal Barony of Eye, Suffolk, following theConquest, in which he was one of William I's chief lieutenants, beingallegedly given the task by William of burying Harold's body afterHastings; Sheriff of Yorks 1068; married Hesilia Crispin (living 1086),gggdau of Rollo The Dane, Duke of Normandy, and died c1071. [Burke'sPeerage]<br />
 <br />
___________________<br />
 <br />
William, according to some, was grandson of Lady Godiva & brother of Harold Godwyn's wife, while not necessarily entirely true, probably there was some relationship. I have William's mother as a daughter of Godiva's husband Leofric Earl of Mercia, by an earlier wife or mistress. There is conjecture that William's father one of the men who accompanied Emma of Normandy to England in 1002 for her marriage with Aethelred.<br />
 <br />
___________________<br />
 <br />
According to Crispin and Macary, "William (Guillaume) Malet de Graville stands out as one of the most imposing figures at the Conquest. There can be no doubt about his presence there, which is subscribed to by William of Poitiers, Guy of Amiens, Orderic Vital, and all the historians of this epoch. So much has been placed on record concerning him that just a few facts of his life will be recited here. He was probably descended from Gerard, a Scandinavian prince and companion of Duke Rollo, which gave the name of the fief of Gerardville or Graville, near Havre. Robert, the eldest son, occurs in a document of about 990 in Normandy. On his mother's side William Malet was of Anglo-Saxon origin, for she was probably the daughter of Leofric, Earl of Mercia, and Godwa or Godgifu, the supposed sister of Thorold the Sheriff in the time of Edward the Confessor, and therefore the aunt of Edwin and Morcar, Earls of Northumberland. He was nearly killed in the battle of Hastings but was rescued by the sire de Montfort and William of Vieuxpont, and was appointed by William the Conqueror to take charge of the body of Harold, a statement that has been disputed. The consensus of opinion favors it, and it is most logical if William Malet's mother was as stated the sister of Algar II., 7th Earl of Mercia, who was the father of Alditha, wife of Harold. He accompanied King William at the reduction of Nottingham and York in 1068, for which he was rewarded with the shreivalty of land in that county. Gilbert de Gand and Robert Fitz Richard were also commanders in this expedition. The following year he was besieged in the castle of York by Edgar, the Saxon prince, and was only saved from surrender by the timely arrival of the Conqueror. In the same year he was attacked by the Danes, who captured the city of York with great slaughter and took William Malet, his wife and children, prisoners, but their lives were spared, as was that of Gilbert de Gand, for the sake of their ransoms. There is evidence that he was slain in this year, but it is uncertain and the date of his death is unknown. An entry in Domesday that "William Malet was seized of this place (Cidestan, Co. Suffolk), where he proceeded on the King's service where he died," would indicate that his death occurred during the compilation of that book. He was witness to a charter of King William to the church of St. Martin-le-Grand, in London, and is there styled "princeps," which title, however, was honorary and not hereditary, having ceased with his death."<br />
 <br />
_________________________<br />
 <br />
William Malet, or Guillaume, as he may have been called, "Sire de Graville", came from Graville Sainte Honorine between Le Havre and Harfleur, in what is today the French province of Normandy. He is said to have had a Norman father and a Saxon (read English) mother, and had some sort of association with King Harold of England before the conquest. William, through his Saxon mother, may actually have been related to King Harold, and also to the well known Lady Godiva. It is also possible that William and Harold were both God fathers of Duke William of Normandy's daughter, Abela.<br />
 <br />
The Malet Castle at Graville Sainte Honorine had an important strategic location, at the mouth of the Seine. It has now fallen into the sea, though some remnants of it may still be visible. A large section of wall with large iron rings attached was still there just over 100 years ago. The Abbey church, in which some of the Malets are buried, is now in the town of Le Havre. Though William Malet had connections to both sides in the conflict to come, his main allegiance was to Duke William of Normandy.<br />
 <br />
William fought with distinction at Hastings, as the following Excerpt from Wace's "Roman de Rou" attests<br />
William, whom they call Mallet, Boldly throws himself among them; with his flashing sword Against the English he makes furious onset; but his shield they clove, and his horse beneath him killed, and himself they would have slain. When came the Sire de Montfort and Lord William de Vez-Pont with the great force which they had, him they bravely rescued. There many of their men they lost; Mallet they remounted on the field nn a fresh war-horse.<br />
 <br />
When the battle was over, Duke William entrusted William Malet to attend to the burial of the dead English king. The body was buried under a heap of stones on top of a cliff at Hastings overlooking the shore that Harold had so bravely defended. William placed a stone on the grave with the epitaph:<br />
 <br />
 <br />
"By command of the Duke, you rest here a King, O Harold, that you may be guardian still of the shore and sea".<br />
This burial of Harold was only temporary and the body was later re-buried at Harold's Abbey at Waltham.<br />
 <br />
William and his brother Durand held lands in Lincolnshire, England, during the reign of Edward the Confessor, and through the reign of Harold right up to the conquest, in addition to those in Normandy. These Lincolnshire holdings, all in the Danelaw, probably came from William and Durand's mother. After the conquest William's English holdings were greatly increased, again, principally in the Danelaw, as English lands were taken from their Saxon owners and handed over to Norman Barons. It is likely that Duke William conferred these estates on William, partly because of his loyalty and skill in battle, but also because of his prior connections with his Danish "cousins" there. Perhaps the Duke felt that William was the best man to bring these proud, warlike and independent settlers under the control of their new King.<br />
 <br />
William was dead at the time of the Domesday survey in 1086, but the holdings at that time of his son Robert, and of his wife, give a good indication of the extent of his estates. He held large parts of what are today Suffolk and Norfolk, with smaller amounts of land in Lincolnshire and Yorkshire. Eye, in Suffolk appears to have been William's stronghold. Here he built a Motte and Bailey castle, after the Norman fashion. Nothing remains of the Norman fortifications, but the outline of the baileys and "Castle Mound", are still evident. There is even a slight indication of where the Market, founded by William Malet under Royal License would have been held.<br />
 <br />
William married Hesilia Crispin, by whom he had two sons, Robert and Gilbert, and one daughter, Beatrice. Robert and possibly Gilbert, along with their uncle Durand, accompanied their father at the battle of Hastings. The arms shown at the top of the page, likely carried by the Malets at Hastings, were used by many generations of the Malet family, both in England and in France, and can be seen on the Bayeux tapestry.<br />
 <br />
William was made Sheriff of York and granted considerable lands in Yorkshire following the building of the first Norman castle there (the mound now supports 'Clifford's Tower') in 1068. He and his fellow captains, Robert Fitz-Richard and William of Ghent, with 500 picked knights had to fight off a local revolt, headed by Edgar the Atheling; this in or shortly after January 1069. Robert Fitz-Richard and many of his men were killed and it was only by the timely arrival of King William that the City was saved. The natives remained restless and had another, token go, as soon as King William left but were quickly put down. The troops were strengthened and another castle built on the other side of the river from the original but, notwithstanding, in September 1069, William, his wife and two of his children were captured by a combined force of Danes and English under Sweyn of Denmark supported by Earls Waltheof and Gospatric and the Northumbrians, when York fell to them after a terrible fight. This led to King William ordering the burning and killing of everything in the north and Domesday, even 16 years later, records most of northern England as still being waste and uninhabited.<br />
 <br />
William, his wife and two children must have been released some time later and William retained most of his lands apart from those in Yorkshire, which will have come with the office of Sheriff, which had been taken from him. At some point the King awarded William the appellation of "Princep", and in the Chart granted by the King to the church of St. Martin le Grand, his signature appears as "Wilielmus Malet Princep". In the context of the times, Princep would likely have been interpreted as "leader, or chief". William is believed to have died fighting "Hereward the Wake" in the Fens near Ely Cathedral, which lies between South Lincolnshire, Cambridgeshire and Norfolk (and in the middle of the Malet holdings), in 1071. The Domesday book records that "...He went into the marsh", and that "...he went on the King's service, where he died".<br />
 <br />

 <br />
NORMAN SHERIFFS<br />
By 1066, when William the Conqueror seized power, he replaced all of the existing sheriffs with his own loyal comrades in arms. When William conveyed the offices of sheriff to his Normans, he also bestowed to them the title "Vicomte," which added nobility to their positions. He allowed Vicomte sheriffs to build castles, a powerful symbol of privilege and a far greater honor than had ever been granted to prior Anglo-Saxon sheriffs. The castles were a sign of aggressive force. This fortification symbolism helped identify William as the incomparable authority in the newly conquered land.<br />
 <br />
The most famous William the Conqueror sheriff was a man named William Malet, a ferocious warrior. During the Battle of Hasting his horse was killed from under him. Mounting a fresh horse, he continued leading the charge, killing the enemy along the way, to a Norman victory. William continued to use Malet to crush insurgent forces within his reign.. . . As a reward, William named Malet the sheriff of Yorkshire.<br />
 <br />
King William sought aggressive types for the office of sheriff whose ambitions were consistent with his. Those willing to squeeze the peasants to their maximum were the best qualified in William's eyes. He instituted the practice of selling the office to the highest bidder. This brought forth evil men willing to pay exorbitant prices for the office and then willing to do whatever it took to recoup their investment. . . No one spoke out for the peasantry because their only representative to the king was the very sheriffs embezzling them. The most notorious was Picot, Sheriff of Cambridgeshire. . . . Monks describe him as:<br />
 <br />
a hungry lion, a prowling wolf, a crafty fox, a filthy swine, a dog without shame, who stuffed his belly like an insatiable beast as though the whole country were a single corpse.<br />
 <br />
If events reduced production within the shires and thereby reduced the prosperity of King William, the sheriff was then forced to press the peasants even more to make up for the deficiency. In 1083, William levied the highest tax assessment of his reign to make up for the previous year's famine and low production. . . . To enhance their income, sheriffs commonly pillaged Church properties. . . .<br />
 <br />
The only coin in circulation in twelfth century England was the silver penny. It was the responsibility of the sheriff to police the silver content in the coinage. If the sheriff failed to see that the tender did not meet quality assurance in the amount of silver content versus the alloy percentage, he was held personally liable for the shortage. Because this burden was placed on the sheriffs in the area that effected them the most, their pocketbooks. . . .Enforcement of the matter was particularly unkind under the reign of King Henry II to punish offenders that circulated "bastard" coins. The first offense routinely resulted in the severing of a hand or castration. . . .<br />
 <br />
The coming of King John in 1199 brought about one of the most stirring periods in the history of the medieval sheriff. . . . As King John waged war against the Welsh, the French, and the Irish, he placed the emphasis upon the sheriffs to finance his wars. . . . Because of the sheriff's authority and ability to raise funds, the 13th century saw the sheriff as the most powerful administrative force in medieval England. . . .<br />
 <br />
King John personally knew every one of the 100 or so sheriffs that he appointed between 1199 and 1216. Some were his intimate friends and most trusted advisors. In contrast to the prior practice of King Richard, he appointed only two members of the Church to the post. He instead chose to select intense, secular men, with strong military backgrounds. . . . His deliberate selection of men of harsh demeanor . . . was considered by people of his time as a substantive answer for the difficult issues of the day . . . tough men for tough times. . .<br />

"Cil de Saie," mentioned by Wace in his account of the battle ofHastings, took his name from the vill of Saium or Say, about nine milesto the west of Exmes, the caput of Roger de Montgomeri's NormanViscountcy, and held under Roger in Normandy, as he afterwards did inEngland. He is known as Picot de Say, for Ficot, or Picot, at first asobriquet only, is given as his recognised appellation in Domesday;thought the son and grandson that inherited his barony were always styledDe Say. There is still extant the charter by which he, with his wifeAdeloya, and his two sons, Robert and Henry, bestowed lands in 1060 onthe Abbey founded by his suzerain at Seez. He came over to England inRoger's train; and was one of those to whom, according to Orderic, thenew Earl 'gave commands' in Shorpshire. Twenty-nine manors wre allowed tohim; and Clun, as the largest of them, gave its name to his bariony. In1083, he, with the other principal men of the country, was summoned toattend at the dedication of Shrewsbury Abbey. His son Henry succeededhim, and was followed in the next generation by Helias.

 <br />
    Picot, who was a substantial under-tenant of Earl Roger of Montgomery at Clun and elsewhere in Shropshire, is shown by the devolution of his lands to have been Picot de Say. Robert, Abbot of St-Martin de Sees granted the privilege of burial to Robert and Henry their sons; and in return Picot (as he is henceforth called) and his wife gave to the abbey "edificium matris Picot cum virgulto quod habebat juxta ecclesiam sancte Marie de Vrou" and confirmed a third of the church of Sai which Osmelinus de Sayo gave at the same time, giving also meadow land in the meadows "de Juvigneio"; the charter is subscribed by Earl Roger, Picot and his wife and two sons. "Vrou" is clearly Urou, the next parish to Sai, and Juvigni the parish immediately south of Sai. An agreement was made on 17 May 1086 in the court of Robert de Belleme between Picot de Saio and Droco de Coimis as to the dower which Droco's brother William had given to Adeloia his wife, who had been remarried to Picot. This is further evidence of Picot's tenure under the house of Montgomery-Belleme, and suggests that the charter to St-Martin de Sees was considerably later than 1060, the date to which it has been assigned.

    _________________________________<br />
 <br />
    The first member of the family of Say mentioned by Sir William Dugdale is Picot de Say, who, in the time of the Conqueror, and living in 1083, was one of the principal persons in the co. Salop under Roger de Montgomery, Earl of Shrewsbury.

    He (Cadwgan) married a daughter of Robert of Sai, a Norman Baron (Lord of Clun) and his wife, Adeloya. Robert was variously called Robert de Sai, which was his correct name, Ficot de Saium and Picot de Say. His estate was sitmacted in the valley of the Clun fiver in south-wester Shropshire and it was very extensive, including nearly all of Rinlau Hundred and a large part of Rinteurde Hundred. Cadwgan had seven sons, but only the fifth, Henry, and the sixth, Gruffyd, were by his wife, the daughter of Lord Robert de Sai. Each of the others was by a different mother and probably illegitimate according to modern standards. [The Weaver Genealogy]<br />

FROM UPHAM FAMILY HISTORY pp. 55-59: "William de Warrenne, Earl ofWarrenne in Normandy, and first Earl of Surrey, a near kinsman of Williamthe Conqueror, held immense possessions in England, the reward of hisservices at the battle of Hastings. He married Gundred, or Gundreda,daughter of King William, and resided at the castle of Lewes, in Sussex."<br />

 <br />
The Following is from pboren@@pnut.rand.org (Pat Boren) and may contain errors:<br />
 <br />
William de Warenne was considered a near kinsman of William the Conqueror. He received large grants of land in England in rocognition of his distinguished part in the Battle of Hastings. In 1075 he was appointed joint chief justiciar and helped suppress the rebellion of the earls of Hereford and Norfolk. In 1077 he founded the St. Pancras Priory of Lewes (where he is buried), the first house of the Cluniac order in Enland. The position of his castle at Lewes rendered his loyalty especially useful to King William Rufus during the rebellion of 1088, for which he was granted the earldom of Surrey. In addition to Lewes, William held over 40 manors in sussex. He married Gundred and had Reginald, Edith and William.<br />
 <br />
From Wikipedia<br />
 <br />
William de Warenne, 1st Earl of Surrey, (died 1088) was one of the Norman aristocrats who fought at the Battle of Hastings and became great landowners in England.<br />
 <br />
He was a son of Ralph de Warenne and Emma and a grandnephew of duchess Gunnor, wife of duke Richard I of Normandy. As a young man he helped secure duke William's hold on Normandy, most notably in the campaigns of 1052 through 1054 which culminated in the Battle of Mortemer. After this battle Roger de Mortemer forfeited most of his lands, and the duke gave them to William. The de Warenne surname derives from the castle of that name on the River Varenne, which flows through the territory William acquired in Upper Normandy.<br />
 <br />
William was one of the nobles who advised duke William when the decision to invade England was being considered. He fought at Hastings, and afterwards received the Rape of Lewes in Sussex, and subsequently lands in twelve other shires. In addition to the cluster around Lewes, there were clusters around the castles he built at Castle Acre in Norfolk and Conisbrough in Yorkshire. By the time of the Domesday survey he was one of the wealthiest landholders in England.<br />
 <br />
William was loyal to William II, and it was probably after the rebellion of 1088 that he was created Earl of Surrey. He died shortly afterwards of wounds he received while helping suppress the rebellion.<br />
 <br />
He married twice, first to Gundred (Latin: Gundrada), sister of Gerbod, Earl of Chester, and secondly to a sister of Richard Gouet. William and Gundred had three children: William de Warenne, 2nd Earl of Surrey (d. 1138); Edith de Warenne who married Gerard de Gournay; and Reynold de Warenne, who inherited lands from his mother in Flanders and died before 1118.<br />
 <br />
It was at one time thought that Gundred was a daughter of William the Conqueror and his wife Matilda of Flanders. This was disproved in the 19th Century but nevertheless remains in many faulty genealogies. William and Gundred were married around 1070, when her brother Frederick was killed by Hereward the Wake.<br />

Henry I (c.1068 - 1 December 1135), called variously Henry Beauclerk,Henri Beauclerc, or Henry Beauclerc because of his scholarly interests,was the third son of William the Conqueror.<br />
 <br />
His reign as King of England extended from 1100 to 1135, succeeding his brother, William II Rufus. He also was known by the nickname "Lion of Justice", due to the refinements which he brought about in the rudimentary administrative and legislative machinery of the time.<br />
 <br />
He seized power after the death of William II, which occurred (conveniently) during the absence of his brother Robert Curthose on the Crusades.<br />
 <br />
His reign is noted for his opportunistic political skills, the aforementioned improvements in the machinery of government, the integration of the divided Anglo-Saxon and Normans within his kingom, his reuniting of the dominions of his father, and his controversial (although well-founded) decision to name his daughter as his heir.<br />
 <br />
Early life<br />
Henry was born between May 1068 and May 1069, probably in Selby, Yorkshire in England. His mother, Queen Matilda of Flanders, named him after her uncle, King Henry I of France. As the youngest son of the family, he was most likely expected to become a bishop and was given extensive schooling for a young nobleman of that time period. William of Malmesbury asserts that Henry once remarked that an illiterate king was a crowned ass. He was probably the first Norman ruler to be fluent in the English language.<br />
 <br />
His father William, upon his death in 1087, bequeathed his dominions to his sons in the following manner:<br />
    * Robert received the Duchy of Normandy<br />
    * William received the Kingdom of England<br />
    * Henry received 5,000 pounds of silver<br />
 <br />
Orderic Vitalis reports that King William declared to Henry: "You in your own time will have all the dominions I have acquired and be greater than both your brothers in wealth and power."<br />
 <br />
Henry played his brothers off against each other. Eventually, wary of his devious manouevring, they acted together and signed an accession treaty which effectively barred Henry from both thrones, stipulating that if either died without an heir, the two dominions of their father would be reunited under the surviving brother.<br />
 <br />
Seizing the throne of England<br />
When William II was killed by an arrow whilst hunting on 2 August 1100, however, Robert was returning from the First Crusade. His absence, along with his poor reputation among the Norman nobles, allowed Henry to seize the keys of the royal hoard at Winchester. He was accepted as king by the leading barons and was crowned three days later on 5 August at Westminster. He secured his position among the nobles by an act of political appeasement, issuing the Charter of Liberties, which is considered a forerunner of the Magna Carta.<br />
 <br />
First marriage<br />
On 11 November 1100 Henry married Edith, daughter of King Malcolm III of Scotland. Since Edith was also the niece of Edgar Atheling, the marriage united the Norman line with old English line of kings. The marriage greatly displeased the Norman barons, however, and as a concession to their sensibilities Edith changed her name to Matilda upon becoming queen. The obverse side of this coin, however, was that Henry, by dint of his marriage, became far more acceptable to the Anglo-Saxon populace.<br />
 <br />
William of Malmesbury describes Henry thusly: "He was of middle stature, greater than the small, but exceeded by the very tall; his hair was black and set back upon the forehead; his eyes mildly bright; his chest brawny; his body fleshy."<br />
 <br />
Conquest of Normandy<br />
In 1101, the following year, Robert Curthose attempted to seize the crown by invading England. In the Treaty of Alton, Robert agreed to recognize Henry as King of England and return peacefully to Normandy, upon receipt of an annual sum of 2000 marks, which Henry proceeded to pay.<br />
 <br />
In 1105, to eliminate the continuing threat from Robert and to obviate the drain on his fiscal resources, Henry led an expeditionary force across the English Channel. In 1106, he defeated his brother's Norman army decisively at Tinchebray in Normandy. He imprisoned his brother, initially in the Tower of London, subsequently at Devizes Castle and later at Cardiff. Henry appropriated the Duchy of Normandy as a possession of England, and reunited his father's dominions.<br />
 <br />
He attempted to reduce difficulties in Normandy by marrying his eldest son, William, to the daughter of Fulk of Jerusalem, Count of Anjou and a serious enemy.<br />
 <br />
Activities as a King<br />
Henry's need for finance to consolidate his position led to an increase in the activities of centralised government. As king, Henry carried out social and judicial reforms, including:<br />
    * issuing the Charter of Liberties<br />
    * restoring laws of King Edward the Confessor.<br />
 <br />
Henry was also known for some brutal acts. He once threw a traitorous burgher named Conan Pilatus from the tower of Rouen; the tower was known from then on as "Conan's Leap". In another instance that took place in 1119, King Henry's son-in-law, Eustace de Pacy, and Ralph Harnec, the constable of Ivry, exchanged their children as hostages. When Eustace blinded Harnec's son, Harnec demanded vengeance. King Henry allowed Harnec to blind and mutiliate Eustace's two daughters, who were also Henry's own grandchildren. Eustace and his wife, Juliane, were outraged and threatened to rebel. Henry arranged to meet his daughter at a parlay at Breteuil, only for Juliane to draw a crossbow and attempt to assassinate her father. She was captured and confined to the castle, but escaped by leaping from a window into the moat below. Some years later Henry was reconciled with his daughter and son-in-law.<br />
 <br />
Legitimate children<br />
He had two children by Edith-Matilda, who died in 1118: Matilda, born February 1102, and William Adelin, born November 1103. Disaster struck when William, his only legitimate son, perished in the wreck of the White Ship on 25 November 1120 off the coast of Normandy. Also among the dead were two of Henry's illegitimate children, as well as a niece, Lucia-Mahaut de Blois. Henry's grieving was intense, and the succession was in crisis.<br />
 <br />
Second marriage<br />
On 29 January 1121, he married Adeliza, daughter of Godfrey, Count of Louvain, but there were no children from this marriage. Left without male heirs, Henry took the unprecedented step of making his barons swear to accept his daughter Empress Matilda, widow of Henry V, the Holy Roman Emperor, as his heir.<br />
 <br />
Death and legacy<br />
Henry visited Normandy in 1135 to see his young grandsons, the children of Matilda and Geoffrey. He took great delight in his grandchildren, but soon quarreled with his daughter and son-in-law and these disputes led him to tarry in Normandy far longer than he originally planned.<br />
 <br />
Henry died of food poisoning from eating foul lampreys in December 1135 at St. Denis le Fermont in Normandy and was buried at Reading Abbey, which he had founded 14 years before.<br />
 <br />
Although Henry's barons had sworn allegiance to his daughter as their queen, her sex and her remarriage into the House of Anjou, an enemy of the Normans, allowed Henry's nephew Stephen of Blois to come to England and claim the throne with popular support.<br />
The struggle between the Empress and Stephen resulted in a long civil war known as the Anarchy. The dispute was eventually settled by Stephen's naming of Matilda's son, Henry, as his heir in 1153.<br />
 <br />
Illegitimate Children<br />
King Henry is famed for holding the record for the largest number of acknowledged illegitimate children born to any English king, with the number being around 20 or 25. He had many mistresses, and identifying which mistress is the mother of which child is difficult. His illegitimate offspring for whom there is documentation are:<br />
 <br />
   1. Robert FitzRoy. His mother was probably a member of the Gai family.<br />
   2. Sibylla FitzRoy, married King Alexander I of Scotland. Probably the daughter of Sibyl Corbet.<br />
   3. Reginald FitzRoy. His mother was Sibyl Corbet.<br />
   4. Maud FitzRoy, married Conan III, Duke of Brittany<br />
   5. Richard FitzRoy, perished in the wreck of the White Ship. His mother was Ansfride.<br />
   6. Fulk FitzRoy, a monk at Abingdon. His mother may have been Ansfride.<br />
   7. Juliane FitzRoy, married Eustace de Pacy. She tried to shoot her father with a crossbow after King Henry allowed her two young daughters to be blinded. Her mother may have been Ansfride.<br />
   8. Matilda FitzRoy, married Count Rotrou II of Perche, perished in the wreck of the White Ship. Her mother was Edith.<br />
   9. Constance FitzRoy, married Roscelin de Beaumont<br />
  10. Henry FitzRoy, died 1157. His mother was Princess Nest.<br />
  11. Mabel FitzRoy, married William III Gouet<br />
  12. Aline FitzRoy, married Matthieu I of Montmorency<br />
  13. Isabel FitzRoy, daughter of Isabel de Beaumont, sister of Robert de Beaumont, 2nd Earl of Leicester.<br />
  14. Matilda FitzRoy, abbess of Montvilliers<br />
  15. Adeliza FitzRoy. Appears in charters with her brother Robert (below), she was probably daughter of Eda FitzForne.<br />
  16. Robert FitzRoy, died 1172. His mother was Eda FitzForne.<br />
  17. William de Tracy, died shortly after King Henry.<br />
  18. Gilbert FitzRoy, died after 1142. His mother may have been a sister of Walter de Gand.<br />

From Wikipedia<br />
 <br />
William de Warenne, 2nd Earl of Surrey (d. 1138), was the son of William de Warenne, 1st Earl of Surrey and his first wife Gundrada. He is more often referred to as Earl Warenne or Earl of Warenne than as Earl of Surrey.<br />
 <br />
Sometime around 1093 he tried to marry Matilda (or Edith), daughter of king Malcolm III of Scotland. She instead married Henry I of England, and this may be the cause of William's great dislike of Henry I, which was to be his apparent motivator in the following years.<br />
 <br />
He accompanied Robert Curthose in his 1101 invasion of England, and afterwards lost his English lands and titles and was exiled to Normandy. There he complained to Curthose that he expended great effort in the duke's behalf and had in return lost nearly everything. Curthose's return to England in 1103 was apparently made to convince his brother to restore William's earldom. This was successful, though Curthose had to give up he had received after the 1101 invasion, and subsequently William was loyal to king Henry.<br />
 <br />
To further insure William's loyalty Henry considered marrying him to one of his many illegitimate daughters. He was however disuaded by Archbishop Anselm of Canterbury, for any of the daughters would have been within the prohibited degrees of consanguinity. The precise nature of the consanguinous relationship Anselm had in mind has been much debated, but it is most likely he was referring to common descent from the father of duchess Gunnor.<br />
 <br />
William was one of the commanders on Henry's side (against Robert Curthose) at the Battle of Tinchebray in 1108. Afterwards, with his loyalty thus proven, he became more prominent in Henry's court.<br />
 <br />
In 1110 Curthose's son William Clito escaped along with Helias of Saint-Saens, and afterwards Warenne received the forfeited Saint-Saens lands, which were very near his own in upper Normandy. By this maneuver king Henry further assured his loyalty, for the successful return of Clito would mean at the very least Warenne's loss of this new territory.<br />
 <br />
He fought at the Battle of Bremule in 1119, and was at Henry's deathbed 1135.<br />
 <br />
In 1118 William acquired the royal-blooded bride he desired when married Isabella de Vermandois. She was a daughter of count Hugh of Vermandois, a son of Henry I of France, and was the widow of Robert de Beaumont, 1st Earl of Leicester.<br />
 <br />
By Isabella he had 3 sons and 2 daughters:<br />
    * William de Warenne, 3rd Earl of Surrey;<br />
    * Reginald, who inherited his father's property in upper Normandy. He married Adeline, daughter of William, lord of Wormgay in Norfolk, by whom he had a son William, whose daughter and sole heir Beatrice married first Dodo, lord Bardolf, and secondly Hubert de Burgh;<br />
    * Ralph<br />
    * Gundrada, who married first Roger de Beaumont, 2nd earl of Warwick, and second William, lord of Kendal, and is most remembered for expelling king Stephen's garrison from Warwick Castle;<br />
    * Ada, who married Henry of Scotland, 3rd Earl of Huntingdon<br />

William de Warenne, 3rd Earl of Surrey (d. 1148), was the eldest son of the William de Warenne, 2nd Earl of Surrey and Elizabeth of Vermandois. He was thus a great-grandson of Henry I of France, and half-brother to Robert de Beaumont, 1st Earl of Leicester, Waleran de Beaumont, and Henry de Beaumont, Earl of Bedford.<br />
 <br />
He was generally loyal to king Stephen. He fought at the Battle of Lincoln (1141), and was one of the leaders of the army that pursued the empress Matilda in her flight from Winchester, and which captured Robert of Gloucester.<br />
 <br />
He was one of the nobles that, along with Louis VII of France, took crusading vows at Vezelay in 1146, and he accompanied the initial army of the First Crusade the next year. He was killed by a Turkish attack while the army was marching across Anatolia on their way to the Holy Land.<br />
 <br />
William married Adela (or Ela), daughter of William Talvas, count of Ponthieu, who was the son of Robert of Bellême. They had one child, a daughter, Isabel, who was his heir. She married first William of Blois, second son of king Stephen, and who became earl of Warenne or Surrey. After he died without children in October 1159, she married Hamelin, half-brother of Henry II, who also became Earl of Warenne or Surrey. He took the de Warenne surname, and their descendents carried on the earldom.<br />

TRIMBLE, Chillion N. (Col.)<br />
Died at his residence in Crownpoint, on the 6th instant, Col. CHILLION N. TRIMBLE, aged 64 years.<br />
Col. Trimble was a highly respectable citizen, a large and wealthy farmer, and had held many offices of responsibility and trust, among which was that of Sheriff of the County. He leaves a widow and sons and daughters, and a large circle of friends and relatives who sincerely mourn his loss.<br />
The Elizabethtown Post 13 March 1862<br />
---------------------------------------------------------------<br />
Chilion A. Trimble was a descendant of one of the pioneer families of Crown Point. He was born either in 1797 or 1798, according to the evidence given in the 1850 census. The date of his death is unknown.<br />
 <br />
 He served as Town Supervisor for Crown Point in 1831, 1833, 1834, and 1838, and was Essex County Sheriff between 1843 and 1846.<br />
 <br />
 According to the 1850 census, his true occupation was that of a farmer (correspondence indicates that he had speculated in land). The same census showed that he was married and had seven children between the ages of one and eleven.<br />
 <br />
 Most of the correspondence, especially in the later years, concerned land transactions. The law firm of Swetland and Beckwith (also Beckwith and Immin, and Beckwith and Johnson) of Plattsburgh, and Samuel Keese, of Keeseville, were major land correspondents.<br />
 <br />
 The most interesting letters in the collection, however, are those dealing with the local and state politics from the mid-1830's to the mid1860's. One correspondent of particular interest was Anson H. Allen, editor of the Keeseville Herald. When he moved to Westport in 1862 he became editor of the Essex County Times and the Westport Herald. The other is Oliver Keese, a member of the prominent Keese family. These letters give fairly detailed accounts of political action in Essex County at the time.<br />
 <br />
 The letters were donated to the Clinton County Historical Association by Mrs. Watson and Mrs. LaDue, and are on deposit in Special Collections.<br />
---------------------------------------------------------------<br />
Chilion Alexander Trimble was a descendant of one of the pioneer families of Crown Point. He was born September 13, 1798 at Crown Point, New York, died in March 1862, and is buried in the First Congregational ("Brick Church") Cemetery on the green in Crown Point village. He was the son of Alexander Trimble and Agnes Burwell and married Charlotte F. Stone on September 4, 1838. (Furness)<br />
 According to the 1850 census, his true occupation was that of a farmer (correspondence indicates that he had speculated in land). The same census showed that he had seven children between the ages of one and eleven. See also the Agricultural Section of the 1855 New York State Census (Furness). Trimble served as Town Supervisor for Crown Point in 1831, 1833, 1834, and 1838, and was Essex County Sheriff between 1843 and 1846.<br />

Humbert I (Hubert de Maurienne in French, Umberto I Biancamano di Morianain Italian and in official documents, born in 980 - died at Hermillon in1047 or 1048) became the first count of the House of Savoy, which ruledSavoy throughout its independent existence and furnished the monarchs ofItaly after the unification.<br />
 <br />
Surnamed Biancamano (literally meaning white-handed - in the original sense this should have meant a very generous man), Humbert came of noble stock from either Saxony, Italy, Burgundy or Provence.<br />
 <br />
Humbert married Ancilla, or Auxilia or Ancilia (Austrian, daughter of the Master of Ceremonies of the House of Burgundy) and had at least four sons:<br />
   1. Amedeo, later Amedeus I of Savoy<br />
   2. Aimone (died 1054 or 1055), bishop of Sion<br />
   3. Burcado, or Burcardo (died 1068 or 1069), bishop of Lyons<br />
   4. Oddone<br />
Some authors believe that he had further sons.<br />
 <br />
During the campaigns of Rudolph of Burgundy to make Rome the imperial seat, Humbert supported the Emperor (of which family he was an adherent by marriage) with provisions and soldiers. Thus Rudolph installed him in 1003 as the count of the mountainous region of Aosta and of the northern Viennois as a reward.<br />
 <br />
Humbert in turn protected the right flank during the advance of the Holy Roman Empire into Italy. However the county was essentially autonomous after the fall of the Ottonian Dynasty of the Holy Roman Empire which was unconcerned about a minor power.<br />
 <br />
In 1032 he received the Maurienne, his native county, from Conrad II the Salian whom he had helped in his Italian campaigns against archbishop Aribert of Milan.<br />

King Louis IX of France or Saint Louis (April 25, 1214/1215-August 25,1270) was King of France from 1226 until his death. Born at Poissy,France, he was a member of the Capetian dynasty and the son of King LouisVIII and Blanche of Castile.<br />
 <br />
Life<br />
Much of what we know of Louis' life comes from Jean de Joinville's famous biography of Louis, Life of Saint Louis. Joinville was a close friend, confidant, and counselor to the king, and also participated as a witness in the papal inquest into Louis' life that ended with his canonization in 1297 by Pope Boniface VIII.<br />
 <br />
Louis was eleven years old when his father died in 1226. He was crowned king the same year in the cathedral at Reims.<br />
 <br />
Because of Louis' youth, his mother, Blanche of Castile, ruled France as regent until 1234, when Louis was deemed of age to rule himself. She continued as an important counsellor to the king until her death 1252.<br />
 <br />
Louis married on May 27, 1234, Marguerite de Provence (1221-December 21, 1295), the sister of Eleanor, the wife of Henry III.<br />
 <br />
Louis was the elder brother of Charles I of Sicily (1227-1285), whom he created count of Anjou, thus founding the second Angevin dynasty.<br />
 <br />
Louis brought an end to the Albigensian Crusade in 1229 after signing an agreement with Count Raymond VII of Toulouse that cleared his father of wrong-doing. Raymond VI had been suspected of murdering a preacher on a mission to convert the Cathars.<br />
 <br />
Louis's piety and kindness towards the poor were much celebrated. He went on crusade twice, in 1248 (Seventh Crusade) and then in 1270 (Eighth Crusade). Both crusades were total failures. After initial success in his first attempt, Louis's army was met by overwhelming resistance from the Egyptian army and citizens. In 1249, Louis was eventually defeated and taken prisoner in Mansoura, Egypt. Louis and his companions were then released in return for the surrender of the French army and a large ransom. He died near Tunis during the latter expedition on August 25, 1270 traditionally during an outbreak of plague but thought by modern scholars to be dysentery.<br />
 <br />
Some of his entrails were buried directly on the spot in Tunisia, where a Tomb of Saint-Louis can still be visited today, whereas other parts of his entrails were sealed in an urn and placed in the Basilica of Monreale, Palermo, where they still remain. His corpse was taken to the French royal necropolis at Saint-Denis, resting in Lyon on the way. His tomb at Saint-Denis was a magnificent gilt brass monument designed in the late 14th century. It was melted down during the French Wars of Religion, at which time the body of the king disapeared. Only one finger was rescued and is kept at Saint-Denis.<br />
 <br />
Pope Boniface VIII proclaimed the canonization of Louis in 1297; he is the only French monarch ever to be made a saint.<br />
 <br />
Louis IX was succeeded by his son, Philippe III.<br />
 <br />
Patron of arts and arbiter of Europe<br />
Louis' patronage of the arts drove much innovation in Gothic art and architecture, and the style of his court radiated throughout Europe by both the purchase of art objects from Parisian masters for export and by the marriage of the king's many daughters to foreign husbands and their subsequent introduction of Parisian models elsewhere. Louis' personal chapel, the Sainte-Chapelle in Paris, was copied more than once by his descendants elsewhere. Louis most likely ordered the production of the Morgan Bible, a masterpiece of medieval painting.<br />
 <br />
Saint Louis ruled during the so-called "golden century of Saint Louis", when the kingdom of France was at its height in Europe, both politically and economically. The king of France was regarded as a primus inter pares among the kings and rulers of Europe. He commanded the largest army, and ruled the largest and most wealthy kingdom of Europe, a kingdom which was the European center of arts and intellectual thought (La Sorbonne) at the time. For many, King Louis IX embodied the whole of Christendom in his person. His reputation of saintliness and fairness was already well established while he was alive, and on many occasions he was chosen as an arbiter in the quarrels opposing the rulers of Europe.<br />
 <br />
It should be noted that the prestige and respect felt in Europe for King Louis IX was due more to the attraction that his benevolent personality created rather than to military domination. For his contemporaries, he was the quintessential example of the Christian prince.<br />
 <br />
Religious zeal<br />
This perception of Louis IX as the quintessential Christian prince was reinforced by his religious zeal. Saint Louis was a devout Christian, and he built the Sainte Chapelle ("Holy Chapel"), located within the royal palace complex (now the Paris Hall of Justice), on the Île de la Cité in the center of Paris. The Sainte Chapelle, a perfect example of the Rayonnant style of Gothic architecture, was erected as a shrine for the Crown of Thorns and a fragment of the True Cross, precious relics of the Passion of Jesus. Louis purchased these in 1239-1241 from Emperor Baldwin II of the Latin Empire of Constantinople, for the exorbitant sum of 135,000 livres (the chapel, on the other hand, only cost 60,000 livres to build). This purchase should be understood in the context of extreme religious fervor that existed in Europe in the 13th century. The purchase contributed a lot to reinforce the central position of the king of France in western Christendom, as well as to further increase the renown of Paris, then the largest city of western Europe. It was a time when cities and rulers vied for relics, trying to increase their reputation and fame, and Louis IX had succeeded in securing the most prized of all relics in his capital. The purchase was thus not only an act of devotion, but also a political gesture: the French monarchy was trying to establish the kingdom of France as the "new Jerusalem".<br />
 <br />
Louis IX took very seriously his mission of "lieutenant of God on Earth", with which he had been invested when he had been crowned in Reims. Thus, in order to fulfill his duty, he conducted several crusades, and even though they were unsuccessful, it contributed to the prestige that he enjoyed. Contemporaries would not have understood that the king of France do not lead a crusade to the Holy Land. In the same vein, he also ordered the expulsion of the Jews from France, although the loose control of the central government over the kingdom meant that many Jews actually remained in the provinces. Again, this needs to be understood in the context of the 13th century: the dislike of the Jews was general in Europe, as the Christians held the Jews responsible for the death of Jesus Christ. The decision to expel the Jews was largely welcome in all spheres of society.<br />
 <br />
In all these deeds, Louis IX tried to fulfill the duty of France, which was seen as "the eldest daughter of the Church" (la fille âınée de l'Église), a tradition of protector of the Church going back to the Franks and Charlemagne, who had been crowned in Rome in 800. Indeed, the official Latin title of the kings of France was Rex Francorum, i.e. "king of the Franks", and the kings of France were also known by the title "very Christian king" (Rex Christianissimus). The relationship between France and the papacy was at its peak in the 12th and 13th centuries, and most of the crusades were actually called by the popes from French soil. Eventually, in 1309, the popes even left Rome and relocated to the French city of Avignon.<br />

Wallace Reed Brode<br />
June 12, 1900 to August 10, 1974<br />
By Donald S. McClure<br />
 <br />
DURING HIS LIFETIME WALLACE Brode was known for his broadly based development of applied spectroscopy and for his able administration of numerous science-related organizations. He was equally at home in academe and in government. He used his high intellect and breadth of knowledge to promote the welfare of other people, being truly a scientific statesman.<br />
He was born on June 12, 1900, as one of triplet brothers, each of whom became distinguished as a scientist. Their father, Howard, was a professor of biology, teaching at Whitman College in Walla Walla, a small town in southeastern Washington, where the family was reared. Like other colleges in the Northwest at that time, Whitman had been struggling out of its recent pioneer past in an attempt to become a credible educational institution with slim financial resources but having a dedicated president and faculty.1 Everyone--father, mother, the triplets (Wallace, Robert,2 and Malcolm), and an older son, Stanley--worked for or studied in the college, learning high ideals and hard work. Howard Brode is still honored by a yearly lectureship at Whitman College.<br />
After receiving his B.S. at Whitman, Wallace studied under Roger Adams at the University of Illinois and was awarded his Ph.D. in 1925 with a thesis entitled "A Study of Optically Active Dyes, Mechanism of Dyeing and Absorption Spectra." His lifelong interest in dyes and the relation between their color and their constitution began here.<br />
During his graduate school days he demonstrated an ability to handle several jobs at once: He was listed as a junior chemist at the National Bureau of Standards (NBS) in Washington, D.C., where he found better equipment for his thesis project, but was still a student and assistant at the University of Illinois. The position at the NBS was his introduction to the institution where he later became associate director.<br />
In the years 1926-28 he was a Guggenheim fellow and did what budding scientists did then, went to Europe, where he studied at Leipzig (with Arthur Hantzsch), Zurich (with Victor Henri), and Liverpool (with E. C. C. Baly and R. A. Morton). Publications from these visits appeared promptly in the chemical literature. At the same time, however, he had an appointment with the Bureau of Engraving and Printing to travel in Canada and Europe and to report on methods of currency printing in those places. He was complimented for doing an effective job while getting his travel expenses taken care of. He returned to the United States to take up an appointment as assistant professor of chemistry at Ohio State University in the fall of 1928.<br />
During his 20 years at OSU he produced most of the work in spectroscopy for which he is known. His book Chemical Spectroscopy appeared in 1939, the outgrowth of notes for a course in this subject, and in a greatly expanded second edition in 1943, which sold about 10,000 copies.3 It was the first book to cover a broad range of topics in spectroscopy of interest to chemists. His research papers during this period (about 65) deal with the relation between absorption spectra and constitution of organic dyes, optically active dyes, analytical applications of spectroscopy, and several other subjects. He trained about 40 graduate students during his tenure at OSU, many of whom later assumed major positions in industry and academe.<br />
His course on spectroscopy was well attended, and he must have spent much time and thought on teaching effectively. He persuaded Sargent Scientific Co. to manufacture the ball-and-stick molecular models he designed in 1930, which later became standard teaching aids in chemistry courses everywhere. He designed and built one of the first recording spectrophotometer/spectropolarimeters (1941).<br />
He had a fascination for solar eclipses and observed about six. He was a member of the observing team of a successful expedition in Russian Siberia in June of 1936. This was followed by a grand tour of Russian universities and astronomical observatories. His ability to design and use spectrographic equipment was crucial to the success of these expeditions. His first wife, a physicist at the NBS whom he married in 1926, accompanied him on the Russian expedition. This marriage ended in divorce a few years later.<br />
In late 1940 or early 1941 he was hospitalized for an infection that had to be treated with an antibiotic. His condition worsened until an alert head nurse, Ione (Sunny) Sundstrom, realized that it was the wrong medicine. He was saved and shortly afterward he married Sunny.<br />
During the war he became associated with the Office of Scientific Research and Development and was head of the Paris branch in 1944-45. Intelligence was the function of this branch, and he followed the armed forces as they advanced in order to learn as much as possible about scientific and technical matters in the formerly occupied territory. One example was the manufacture of hydrogen peroxide in highly concentrated form, the oxidant in the V-2 rockets.<br />
Extending his leave from OSU, he became head of the science department at the Naval Ordnance Test Station, Inyokern, California, 1945-47. He turned down an offer to extend his tenure there but remained as a consultant for some time. While still a professor at OSU in 1947, he accepted a temporary position at the NBS as an associate director, but later that same year he acceded to a request from the Central Intelligence Agency to set up a science advisory branch in that organization. He worked very effectively at this project for most of a year but, realizing that he was losing contact with science and scientists, he felt that he could not continue to attract well-qualified people and asked for a part-time arrangement with the NBS. This was not agreed to, so with three jobs to choose from he made up his mind to resign his rather neglected professorship at OSU and in 1948 became associate director of the NBS.<br />
His acceptance, however, depended on a commitment from the then director, Edward Condon, that he could have a small laboratory where he could continue active research. This research was carried on with the help of George Wyman, John Gould, and later May Inscoe, who worked on the spectroscopy of dye molecules. During the years of this project they discovered some unexpected photochemical changes in the spectra and thus began accidentally a study of photochemistry.<br />
Wallace had under his cognizance the following areas of the NBS: chemistry, metallurgy, mineral products, organic and fibrous materials, optics and metrology, foreign relations, education (the NBS had a graduate school), and editorial and publications.<br />
He was an able administrator and was genuinely interested in the people who staffed these programs. He gave encouragement to many young people in furthering their professional careers. In addition to the above duties he edited the Journal of the Optical Society of America with the aid of his assistant, Mary Corning.<br />
Honors that came to him during this period were election to the National Academy of Sciences in 1954, an honorary degree from Whitman College, and an honorary degree from Ohio State University. These two educational institutions sought his advice on several occasions, and he actively assisted in several projects for them.<br />
In his new position Wallace became increasingly a public figure, as the activities of the NBS had impacts on society. In one very public fracas Eisenhower's new secretary of commerce, Sinclair Weeks, actually "fired" the NBS director, Allen V. Astin, when he refused to accept the "judgment of the market place" for a highly promoted battery additive, ADX-2, which NBS research had shown to be worthless. In the uproar that followed, during which Brode and others testified before Congress, the firing was rescinded and Astin served as director for many years afterward. On this and many other occasions Wallace found himself explaining to non-scientists what science is all about. (The hazards of being director of the NBS are also illustrated by the case of Edward Condon, who was hounded by the House Committee on Un-American Activities from March 1948 until he resigned in August 1951. These were the first three years of Brode's associate directorship.)<br />
During this period the NBS was outgrowing its downtown Washington headquarters, and over Wallace's strong objections the decision was finally made to move out of town to Gaithersburg, Maryland. He feared that the NBS would lose valuable contacts with other science-based organizations in Washington and that he personally would lose many valuable ties there. Thus in 1958 he resigned his position at the NBS. He was the obvious choice for the next job, science advisor to Secretary of State John Foster Dulles and later Christian Herter. Probably the major motivation to place a prominent scientist in this position was the sudden realization that the United States was years behind the Soviet Union in space science (the Soviets had just launched their first Sputniks, while the United States months later launched the much smaller Explorers). One aim of this job was the re-establishment of scientific attaché positions in a number of embassies. He was able to persuade several reputable scientists to accept such posts and to identify major scientific opportunities and concerns within the context of foreign policy.<br />
In this same year, 1958, he assumed several new positions: president of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, member of the Board of Governors of the American Institute of Physics, and member of the President's Committee on Scientists and Engineers. He was already a director of the American Chemical Society. He also received two honors: the Exceptional Service Medal from the Department of Commerce for his work at the NBS and the Applied Spectroscopy Medal from the Society for Applied Spectroscopy. In a few more years he became the president of the Optical Society of America in 1961, president of Sigma Xi in 1961, and was awarded the Priestley Medal of the American Chemical Society, its highest award, in 1960. He became president of the American Chemical Society in 1969. This list does not include the many committees and boards he joined during his Washington years.<br />
Because he was a public figure he was invited to give talks at special occasions. He was both entertaining and informative. One subject that seemed especially needed in Washington was the distinction between science and pseudoscience. He also published articles on scientific manpower, developing a national science program, international aspects of science, and science in elementary schools, all of these being subjects of great interest to him.<br />
The 26 years in Washington must have been the best in his busy life. He was a member and officer of the professionally and socially important Cosmos Club where visitors to Washington could be hosted. He and Sunny had a beautiful apartment across the street from the NBS, where many friends were entertained and Wallace could use his musical talents. He could sing parts in Gilbert and Sullivan operettas and also played the flute, as did his brother Robert. These two brothers had great affection for each other and met often in Washington and Berkeley.<br />
Wallace and Sunny made many trips to the American Southwest to indulge their deep interest in American Indian history, culture, and arts. They possessed many unique and beautiful examples of pottery, baskets, and fabrics. Wallace's knowledge of dyes and dyeing led him to study the natural dyes and pigments used by the Indians.<br />
After leaving the State Department in 1960 he had no major institutional affiliation and was able to write, travel, attend to professional society duties, and consult for industry. As his reputation had grown over the years, he was in great demand as lecturer, counselor, and consultant. He was a highly organized person as his detailed diaries show and he remained heavily engaged in these activities for the rest of his life. He died of cancer at the age of 74.<br />
In the words of one who knew him well, "Wallace was a man of unusual intellect with a rare depth and breadth of knowledge. He could extrapolate from specifics and details to broader concepts, from one discipline to interdisciplinary considerations. He was the epitome of integrity in science and in public service."<br />
 <br />
CONTRIBUTIONS TO SCIENCE BY WALLACE BRODE<br />
Brode's scientific publications can be arranged in the following categories beginning with the most important one: relation between the optical spectrum and the structure of organic dyes; analytical methods; organic synthesis; colors and spectra of some inorganic materials; and chemistry of the fatty acids.<br />
Brode's studies of the chemistry and spectroscopy of organic dyes began in 1922 when he was a graduate student of Roger Adams at the University of Illinois. Synthetic organic chemistry had been developing rapidly at this time, driven in part by the search for new dyes. A central question was how does the molecular structure of a dye determine its color? Spectrographs of that period, though clumsy and inaccurate, could measure the absorption spectrum responsible for color, but the absorption bands could not be explained by existing theory: Consider that G. N. Lewis had proposed the electron pair bond only in 1916, and Schroedinger's equation was still to come. In the expectation that useful empirical understanding of the spectra would result, Brode produced a series of carefully executed and extensive studies of the effects of structure on the absorption bands, published from 1926 to 1959.<br />
The azo compounds, related to azobenzene, are the commonest types of dye molecule. They could be prepared easily and in great variety. A typical study was to add substituents such as methyl, halogen, or nitro at various positions on the benzene rings and see how the spectrum changed. Alternatively, one could couple two azobenzenes at the para, meta, or ortho positions and determine from the spectrum how much the two parts interacted. The results showed the importance of the planarity and conjugation of pi-electron systems. Later, with his NBS group he worked on indigo-type dyes in which the photochemistry or sometimes its absence was the most important aspect. For example, the inhibition of cis-trans isomerization by hydrogen bonding in these dyes was discovered.<br />
In the meantime quantum theory was being discovered and developed and actually applied to large molecules. Some of the earliest thinking was done by G. N. Lewis and Melvin Calvin and by T. Foerster in the 1930s. In the next decade Coulson and Longuet-Higgins and later Dewar were making good sense of the spectra of aromatic molecules. During the 1950s the Pariser-Parr-Pople method was being applied with the help of increasingly capable computers. Brode never caught this wave, and much of his detailed work remains to be interpreted in terms of molecular electronic structure. Nevertheless, he did build a large body of information on dye spectra that has been extensively referenced and has influenced the field down to the present day.<br />

Marguerite of Provence (Forcalquier, Spring 1221- December 21, 1295,Paris) was the eldest daughter of Ramon Berenguer IV, Count of Provenceand Beatrice of Savoy.<br />
Her paternal grandparents were Alfonso II, Count of Provence and Gersende II de Sabran, Countess of Forcalquier. Her maternal grandparents were Thomas I of Savoy and Marguerite of Geneva, daughter of William I of Geneva and Beatrice de Faucigny.<br />
Her younger sisters were:<br />
Eleanor of Provence became the Queen consort of Henry III of England.<br />
Sanchia of Provence who became the Queen consort of Richard, Earl of Cornwall and rival King of the Germans.<br />
Beatrice of Provence who was the Queen consort of Charles I of Sicily<br />
On 27 May 1234 at the age of thirteen, Marguerite became the Queen consort of Louis IX of France, by whom she had eleven children.<br />
Marguerite, like her sisters, was noted for her beauty, she was said to be "pretty with dark hair and fine eyes", and in the early years of their marriage she and Louis enjoyed a warm relationship. Her Franciscan confessor, William de St. Pathus, related that on cold nights Marguerite would place a robe around Louis' shoulders, when her deeply religious husband rose to pray. Another anecdote recorded by St. Pathus related that Marguerite felt that Louis' plain clothing was unbecoming to his royal dignity, to which Louis replied that he would dress as she wished, if she dressed as he wished. However, the chronicler Joinville noted with disapproval that Louis rarely asked after his wife and children, and in later years Louis became vexed with Marguerite's ambition.<br />
She accompanied Louis on his first crusade and was responsible for negotiations and ransom when he was captured. She was thus for a brief time the only woman ever to lead a crusade. During this period, while in Damietta, she gave birth to Jean Tristran.<br />
After the death of Louis on his second crusade, during which she remained in France, she returned to Provence.<br />
She was devoted to her sister Queen Eleanor of England, and they stayed in contact until Eleanor's death in 1291. Marguerite herself died four and a half years after her sister, on 21 December 1295. She was seventy-four years old.<br />
 <br />
Marguerite herself became the Queen consort of Louis IX of France and mother to eleven children.<br />

Walter Scott Gillette, my grandfather, was born in Wisconsin, theyoungest of 5 brothers. My grandmother, Ellen McKeown, was born inMoyarget, Co Antrim, Northern Ireland. I believe they met when Walter gota job keeping house for Uncle Jim (James Norris Gillette). Ellen was only16 and Walter was about the same age.<br />
The Gillettes came to California about 1892. James Norris Gillette, Walter's brother, came to California first. He was an attorney and had apprenticed in Wisconsin. Upon arriving in California, he opened a law office and then sent for his parents and younger brothers. James became a state senator, then the governor of California from l907 to l911. He was the one who used to watch out for my grandpa Walter. He got him several jobs, the last of which was at San Quentin as, I believe, a disbursement officer.<br />
Prior to this, Walter had worked in the woods, in Eureka, then became Depot Master at the train station there. After that, he became a Federal Marshall and the family moved to San Francisco. He didn't like the traveling, that his job entailed, and being away from his family, so, in 1907, they moved to San Quentin. In those days they operated under the "spoils" system, so whoever got in could oust the "outs"! He moved my grandfather's family to San Quentin.<br />
Walter and Ellen Gillette had four children: Gertrude Ellen Gillette (White), Royal Walter Gillette, Dorothy Lydia Gillette (Morey) and John McKeown Gillette, who was born in San Quentin.<br />

An interview with Dorothy White Cowan & Phil Zubler<br />
By Jana McPherson Black<br />
Jason D. White and Mary Frances Baltic White were Dorothy's paternal grandparents. Her grandfather had come to San Quentin from Folsom in 1899. Dorothy's father, Walter was born at San Quentin in a two story house next to teh old McGuirk Store that still stands today in the village. Additionally, Dorothy's mother's parents, Walter Scott Gillette and Ellen McKoewn (an Irish woman) came to live at San Quentin in 1907.<br />
Dorothy's mother, Gertrude Ellen Gillette and her father, Charles Baltic White, married after growing up together on the Prison grounds. Charles had lived outside the gates as a young man and had gone to school with Gertruse. Once married, the newly weds first lived together at the Bay View Hotel during the 1920s and 30s. Charles worked at the Jute Mill initially, then as a guard up on the wall at Post #4.<br />
Dorothy recalls going to McGuirk's store where Mr. McGuirk got barrels of beans down form way up high.<br />
Phil  Zubler, son of  Ernest  Zubler moved to San Quentin in 1913. His mother, Grace Jennie Duffy has moved to live on prison grounds in 1895. Ernest Zubler worked first as a guard then in 1915 as a sack inspector, then in 1919 as Supervisor at the Jute Mill.<br />
Walter Gillette was the prison Distribution Officer who ran the clothing factory in the days when inmates wore stripes.<br />

John de Sudeley, son of Harold de Mantes, married Grace de Tracey, daughter and heiress of Henri de Tracey, feudal lord of Barnstaple in Devonshire. They had two children: Ralph, who became the heir of his father, and William. Sir William de Tracey inherited the lands of his mother and assumed her family name, becoming a knight of Gloucestershire, Sir William de Tracey, and holding the lands of his brother by one knight's fee. He married Hawise de Born and had one son, Sir Henry de Tracey (Henry the Hunchback), and two daughters.<br />

Two of the witnesses to that charter lived on property owned by the Normandy branch of the de Tracys, and two of the English witnesses witnessed a previous charter for Henry de Tracy to Barnstaple Priory in 1146. In 1166 William held one feu of his brother, Ralph.<br />
William de Tracy made charitable benefactions in France, building and endowing a house for lepers at a place called Coismas (Commeaux ?). In addition he made gifts to the Priory of St. Stephen, Le Plessis-Grimoult, lands possessed by the family before all finally came to England.<br />

Dear Bill,<br />
Last Feb. I received a letter from Gunilla with the information about the man in the picture, Skipper Nils Petter Sundsrom know as "Kapten Balaklava"". (1818-1878).  The following comments are from her letter.<br />
I visit the local library frequently and last week I looked through a book called "Luleå-yearbook-2007", a new book that is published every year by the archives of the city of Luleå. The book contains articles and photos/ pictures of Luleå and its inhabitants in the old day. Quite interesting! I found this picture of N.P.Sundstrom in one of the yearbooks. N.P. Sundstrom was a sea captain and should fit in somewhere in our genealogy. I believe he was the grandfather of Magnhild Östling, the little old lady you met at the family dinner here in Gammelstad in 1992. Magnhild had a picture of the Nils Petterʼs ship on the wall in her drawing room. She told me a story about N. P. that must have happened in the middle of the 19th century.<br />
The summer had been cold and very short, frost came early and failure of crops resulted in lack of food. When spring came the food supply was more or less finished, people were starving and famine was just around the corner. On top of all of this misfortune the weather continued being winter like and the Gulf of Bothnia stayed frozen until midsummer. When the ice eventually started breaking up lots of people came down to the harbor every day to see if any ship was approaching. One morning a ship could, with the help of binoculars, be seen at the horizon. The approaching ship was the first one to arrive since fall and it had a cargo of grain onboard and the skipper was N.P.S. When the ship arrived at the Luleå harbor the skipper and his crew, were heralded like heroes.<br />
Magnhild also told me that her grandmother had accompanied Nils on a couple of his voyages to England when they were newly married. After their first child was born she had to stay at home.<br />
I read in the yearbook that Nils built a house on Luleå and opened a food store in their house. He was nick named "Balaklave" because he liked to tell people about his sea adventures and especially his most adventurous voyage, the one when his ship came close to the fight at Balaklava (Crimea 1854-55).<br />
Nils, later, after having permanently gone ashore, bought a farm at Hertsön, a few miles north of Luleå. Some of his descendants still live there.<br />
In an email you sent me last August you had a website in Sweden that I tried but its in Swedish and I canʼt translate the information. I would like to find N.P. Sʼs parents and see how he is related. Let me know what you find.<br />

BLOOMINGTON - Keiko Seki Hawkins, 54, Bloomington, passed away Dec. 17,2008, at her home.<br />
After her passing, a private service was provided by her family. Now, as the flowers are starting to bloom, a celebration of life for family and friends will be at 11:30 a.m. Saturday at First Presbyterian Church, 2000 E. College Ave, Normal, at Keiko's request. The family will gather to receive friends immediately following the service. East Lawn Funeral Home in Bloomington handled cremation arrangements.<br />
Memorials may be made to the Japanese Saturday School through Sakura-kai Inc. (attn: Mr. Nakayama), Mistubishi Motorway, Normal, IL 61761 or to the American Cancer Society.<br />
Keiko was born Jan. 24, 1954, in Matsuyama, Ehime, Japan, daughter of Hiroshige and Chigusa Seki. On Oct. 10, 1982, in front of a small gathering of family and friends at the "Little Chapel of the Roses" in Bonita, Calif., she made her vows to Bruce Hawkins. They celebrated 26-plus years of marriage, residing in Madrid, Spain; Matsuyama, Japan; Buffalo, N.Y.; and then settling in Bloomington-Normal in June of 1987.<br />
Together they had three children, Ken Hawkins "Seki Kenji" of Bloomington; Tyson Hawkins "Seki Taizo" of Bloomington and Erika Hawkins "Seki Erikamari" of Savoy. Ken and Tyson are both actuaries, working in the Bloomington-Normal area. Ken works at Pinnacle Actuarial Associates and Tyson works at Country Financial. Erika will begin graduate studies in higher education administration in the fall.<br />
Keiko earned a bachelor's degree in history education from Japan Women's University in 1976. Her relationship with Bruce developed while she attended the Gemological Institute of America in Santa Monica, Calif., for studies in gemology. Later, she spent a summer at Middlebury College in Vermont for studies in Japanese language teaching.<br />
By spring of 1988, she found a professional home for herself in the Japanese Saturday School, which continues to meet at Metcalf School on the ISU campus. For Keiko, the Japanese Saturday School became more than just a place to work and a source of income, it became a way of maintaining significant personal and cultural connections with her homeland. This work also became a way that Keiko could help contribute significantly to internationalizing the local community. One of Keiko's proudest achievements came when she was promoted from teacher to principal of the Japanese Saturday School in 1999.<br />
Keiko was central in forming a group called Morokoshi kai, a social networking support group for Japanese women in international marriages throughout Central Illinois. In Japanese, the word "morokoshi" refers to corn, while an extended meaning of the word refers to things which, like corn, come from outside of Japan and China. With Central Illinois being the heart of corn country, and the women of the group having come to Central Illinois from Japan, "Morokoshi kai" seemed a perfect name for the group.<br />
Also very close to Keiko's heart was a group of women from Japan, Korea, China, Taiwan and the United States who got together frequently at the Hawkins' home to work on shadow boxes. With Keiko as their mentor, each member of the group worked on creating three-dimensional shadow boxes from prints and greeting cards through a meticulous process of creasing, cutting and pasting, layering images by stacking Styrofoam between them or building them up with drops of caulk. This group was not just a means of "arts and crafts" for the women, but a way to build relationships and common bonds.<br />

He was internationally renowned for his studies on stress among dental patients. He developed the Corah Dental Anxiety Scale, a questionnaire to determine stress levels that is used by dentists and researchers around the world.<br />
One of his most successful techniques for combating anxiety was to distract patients by having them play chair-mounted video games during treatment.<br />
A Kenmore native, Corah earned his bachelor's and graduate degrees at UB and taught briefly in the UB psychology department before joining the psychology faculty of Washington University in St. Louis in 1960.<br />
At Washington University, he was chief research psychologist in the Division of Child Psychology and a research assistant professor in medical psychology. He became an expert in perinatal anoxia and was one of the principal investigators on a major grant from the National Institute of Neurological Diseases and Blindness.<br />

Corah received a succession of grants from the National Institute for Dental Research and was a consultant to study sections at the National Institutes of Health.<br />
After retiring from UB in 1996, he continued to work as a consultant on dental stress and the Corah Dental Anxiety Scale.<br />
A former president of the Behavioral Sciences and Health Services Research Group of the International Association for Dental Research, he received the organization's Distinguished Scientist Award.<br />
He was a former president of the Buffalo Health Sciences Chapter of United University Professions, a faculty union, and at the time of his death was chairman of its membership committee.<br />

William de Albini, feudal Lord of Belvoir, in the 6th of Richard I[1195], was with that monarch in the army in Normandy, and the next yearwas sheriff of the counties of Warwick and Leicester, as he wassubsequently of Rutlandshire. In the 2nd of King John [1201], he hadspecial license to make a park at Stoke, in Northampton, and liberty tohunt the fox and hare (it lying within the royal forest of Rockingham).Afterwards, however, he took up arms with the other barons and, leavingBelvoir well fortified, he assumed the governorship of Rochester Castle,which he held out for three months against the Royalists, and ultimatelyonly surrendered when reduced to the last state of famine. Upon thesurrender of Rochester, William Albini was sent prisoner to Corfe Castle,and there detained until his freedom became one of the conditions uponwhich Belvoir capitulated, and until he paid a ransom of 6,000 marks. Inthe reign of Henry III, we find him upon the other side and a principalcommander at the battle of Lincoln, anno 1217, where his formerassociates sustained so signal a defeat.

"Josephine ended her days in St. Petersburg, FL, but had little to do with her brother's family.  There was some bad feeling that she was very wealthy but did nothing to help her brother when he was poor.

From Wikipedia<br />
 <br />
Fulk of Anjou (1092 - November 10, 1143), king of Jerusalem from 1131, was the son of Fulk IV, count of Anjou, and his wife Bertrada (who ultimately deserted her husband and became the mistress of Philip I of France).<br />
 <br />
Count of Anjou<br />
He became count of Anjou (as Fulk V) in 1109. He was originally an opponent of Henry I of England and a supporter of Louis VI of France, but in 1127 he allied with Henry when Henry arranged for his daughter Matilda to marry Fulk's son Geoffrey of Anjou. Fulk went on crusade in 1120, and become a close friend of the Knights Templar. After his return he began to subsidize the Templars, and maintained two knights in the Holy Land for a year.<br />
 <br />
 <br />
Crusader and king<br />
By 1127 Fulk was preparing to return to Anjou when he received an embassy from King Baldwin II of Jerusalem. Baldwin II had no male heirs but had already designated his daughter Melisende to succeed him. Baldwin II wanted to safeguard his daughter's inheritance by marring her to a powerful lord. Fulk was a wealthy crusader and experienced military commander, and a widower. His experience in the field would prove invaluable in a frontier state always in the grip of war.<br />
 <br />
However, Fulk held out for better terms then mere consort of the Queen; he wanted to be king alongside Melisende. Baldwin II, reflecting on Fulk's fortune and military exploits, acquiesced. Fulk abdicated his county seat of Anjou to his son Geoffery and left for Jerusalem, where he married Melisende on June 2, 1129. Later Balwin II bolstered Melisende's position in the kingdom by making her sole guardian of her son by Fulk, Baldwin III, born in 1130.<br />
 <br />
Fulk and Melisende became joint rulers of Jerusalem in 1131 with Baldwin II's death. From the start Fulk assumed sole control of the government, excluding Melisende altogether. He favored fellow countrymen from Anjou to the native nobility. This led to resentment by the second generation of Jerusalem Christians who had grown up there since the First Crusade. These "natives" focused on Melisende's cousin, the popular Hugh II of Le Puiset, count of Jaffa, who was devotedly loyal to the Queen.<br />
 <br />
Fulk saw Hugh as a rival, and it did not help matters when Hugh's own step-son accused him of disloyalty. In 1134, in order to expose Hugh, Fulk accused him of infidelity with Melisende. Hugh rebelled in protest. Hugh secured himself to Jaffa, and allied himself with the Muslims of Ascalon. He was able to defeat the army set against him by Fulk, but this situation could not hold. The Patriarch interceded in the conflict, perhaps at the behest of Melisende. Fulk agreed to peace and Hugh was exiled from the kingdom for three years, a lenient sentence.<br />
 <br />
However, an unsuccessful assassination attempt was made against Hugh. Fulk, or his supporters, were commonly believed responsible, though direct proof never surfaced. The scandal was all that was needed for the queen's party to take over the government in what amounted to a palace coup. Author and historian Bernard Hamilton wrote that the Fulk's supporters "went in terror of their lives" in the palace. Contemporary author and historian William of Tyre wrote of Fulk "he never attempted to take the initiative, even in trivial matters, without (Melisende's) consent". The result was that Melisende held direct and unquestioned control over the government from 1136 onwards. Sometime before 1136 Fulk reconciled with his wife, and a second son, Amalric was born.<br />
 <br />
Securing the borders<br />
Jerusalem's northern border was of great concern. Fulk had been appointed regent of the Principality of Antioch by Baldwin II. As regent he had Raymund of Poitou marry the infant Constance of Antioch, daughter of Bohemund II and Alice of Antioch, and niece to Melisende. However, the greatest concern during Fulk's reign was the rise of Atabeg Zengi of Mosul.<br />
 <br />
In 1137 Fulk was defeated in battle near Barin but allied with the vizier of Damascus. Damascus was also threatened by Zengi. Fulk captured the fort of Banias, to the north of Lake Tiberiasand thus secured the northern frontier.<br />
 <br />
Fulk also strengthened the kingdom's southern border. His butler Paganus built the fortress of Kerak to the south of the Dead Sea, and to help give the kingdom access to the Red Sea, Fulk had Blanche Garde, Ibelin, and other forts built in the south-west to overpower the Egyptian fortress at Ascalon.<br />
 <br />
In 1137 and 1142, Byzantine emperor John II Comnenus arrived in Syria attempting to impose Byzantine control over the crusader states. John's arrival was ignored by Fulk, who declined an invitation to meet the emperor in Jerusalem.<br />
 <br />
Death<br />
In 1143, while the king and queen were on holiday in Acre, Fulk was killed in a hunting accident. His horse stumbled, fell, and Fulk's skull was crushed by the saddle. He was carried back to Acre, where he died on November 10th and was buried in the Church of the Holy Sepulchre. Though their marriage started in conflict, Melisende mourned for him privately as well as publicly. Fulk was survived by his son Geoffery of Anjou by his first wife, and Baldwin III and Amalric I by Melisende.<br />
 <br />
William of Tyre described Fulk as a capable soldier and able politician, but observed that Fulk did not adequately attend to the defense of the crusader states to the north. The Zengids continued their march on the crusader states, culminating in the fall of the County of Edessa in 1144, which led to the Second Crusade (see Siege of Edessa).<br />
 <br />
Family<br />
His first wife was Ermengarde of Maine (died 1126), the daughter of Elias I of Maine. Their children were:<br />
   1. Geoffrey of Anjou<br />
   2. Sibylle of Anjou (1112-1165, Bethlehem), married in 1123 William Clito (div. 1124), married in 1134 Thierry, Count of Flanders<br />
   3. Alice (or Isabella) (1107-1154, Fontevrault), married William Adelin; after his death in the White Ship she became a nun and later Abbess of Fontevrault.<br />

The date of the marriage of Isaac Sheldon and Mary Woodford is not known, but it must have taken place after 13 September 1652, when the Windsor authorities allowed Isaac Sheldon and Samuel Rockwell to keep bachelor's hall. As Isaac's daughter Mary married John Bridgman, 11 January 1670/1, when she was presumably at least fifteen years old, she was born about 1655, and therefore Sheldon's marriage must have taken place about 1653 or 1654.<br />
On 25 June 1657 Isaac was granted six acres of land by the town of Northampton. His home-lot of two acres was bounded west on the highway, east "against the brooke" "Lying against the Landes of Thomas Woodford southrly and Samuell Allen Northrly." He also had two acres on the other side of the highway, eight acres in the Third Square, four acres in the Great Rainbow alias Old Rainbow, three acres in the little Rainbow alias Young Rainbow, four and one-half acres in the East Division, and eleven and one-half acres at Hog's Bladder. On 2 December 1661, he bought land of his father-in-law Thomas Woodford, in the Last Division.<br />
On the 31st of the first month, March 1663, Isaac was admitted a freeman in the Massachusetts Bay Colony, and he was one of the residents of Northampton who, on the eighth of February, 1678/79, took the oath of allegiance to Charles the Second.<br />
At a town meeting held in February 1665/66 he was appointed fenceviewer for the First Division from the Great River, and for that section of the town known as Hog's Bladder, in March 1669/70, January 1670/71, February 1671/72, January 1672/73. He was chosen Constable in January 1668/69 and was sworn into office at a session of the Court held 30 March following. At a session of the Court held in September 1676, Lieutenant William Clark was appointed to administer the Constable's oath to him, indicating another election of Sheldon to that office.<br />

Fulk IV of Anjou (1043 - 1109), also known as Fulk le Réchin, was count of Anjou from 1068 to 1109.<br />
 <br />
The nickname by which he is usually referred has no certain translation. Philologists have made numerous very different suggestions, including "quarreler", "sullen", and "heroic".<br />
 <br />
He was the younger son of Geoffrey (sometimes known as Alberic), count of Gâtinais, and Ermengarde of Anjou, a daughter of Fulk Nera, count of Anjou, and sister of Geoffrey Martel, also count of Anjou.<br />
 <br />
When Geoffrey Martel died without direct heirs he left Anjou to his nephew Geoffrey IV of Anjou, Fulk le Réchin's older brother.<br />
 <br />
Fulk fought with his brother, whose ruled was deemed incompetent, and captured him in 1067. Under pressure from the Church he released Geoffrey. The two brothers soon fell to fighting again, and the next year Geoffrey was again imprisoned by Fulk, this time for good.<br />
 <br />
Substantial territory was lost to Angevin control due to the difficulties resulting from Geoffrey's poor rule and the subsequent civil war. Saintonge was lost, and Fulk had to give the Gâtinais to Philip I of France to placate the king.<br />
 <br />
Much of Fulk's rule was devoted to regaining control over the Angevin baronage, and to a complex struggle with Normandy for influence in Maine and Brittany.<br />
 <br />
In 1096 Fulk wrote an incomplete history of Anjou and its rulers, though the authorship and authenticity of this work is disputed. If he did write it, it is one of the first medieval works of history written by a layman.<br />
 <br />
Fulk may have married as many as five times; there is some doubt regarding two of the marriages.<br />
 <br />
His first wife was Ermengarde de Beaugency. After her death he married Ermengarde de Borbon, and then possibly Ermengarde de Châtellailon. Both these were repudiated, possibly on grounds of consanguinity.<br />
 <br />
Next he married Bertrade de Montfort, who apparently left him for Philip I of France. Finally, he may have married a daughter of Walter of Brienne.<br />
 <br />
He had two sons. The eldest (a son of Ermengarde de Borbon), Geoffrey Martel II, ruled jointly with his father for some time, but died in 1106. The younger (a son of Bertrade de Montfort) succeeded as Fulk V.<br />
 <br />
He also had a daughter, Ermengarde, who married William VII the Young, count of Poitou and duke of Aquitaine.<br />
</p>
<p>
<a name ="NI05005"><b>[NI05005]</b></a><br />
Bertrade de Montfort (c.1070-1117) was the daughter of Simon I deMontfort and Agnes, Countess of Evreux. Her brother was Amaury III deMontfort.<br />
 <br />
In 1089 she married Count Fulk IV of Anjou, and they became the parents of a son, but Bertrade left Fulk and took up with King Philippe. Philippe married her on May 15, 1092, despite the fact that they both had spouses living. He was so enamoured of Bertrade that he refused to leave her even when threatened with excommunication. Pope Urban II did excommunicate him in 1095, and Philip was prevented from taking part in the First Crusade. Astonishingly, Bertrade persuaded Philippe and Fulk to be friends.<br />
 <br />
Bertrade and Philippe had four children together:<br />
   1. Philippe de France, Count of Mantes (c. 1093 [?]-1123)<br />
   2. Fleury de France, Lord of Nangis (1095 [?]-1118)<br />
   3. Cécile (1097-1145), married (1) Tancred, Prince of Galilee; married (2) Pons of Tripoli<br />
   4. Eustachie (c. 1095-?), married Jean, Count of Etampes<br />
 <br />
According to Orderic Vitalis, Bertrade was anxious that one of her sons succeed Philippe, and sent a letter to King Henry I of England asking him to arrest her stepson Louis. Orderic also claims she sought to kill Louis first through the arts of sorcery, and then through poison. Whatever the truth of these allegations, Louis succeeded Philippe in 1108. Bertrade lived on until 1117; William of Malmesbury says: "Bertrade, still young and beautiful, took the veil at Fontevraud Abbey, always charming to men, pleasing to God, and like an angel.". Her son from her first marriage was Fulk V of Anjou who later became King of Jerusalem. The dynasties founded by Fulk's sons ruled for centuries, one of them England (Plantagenet), the other Jerusalem).<br />

Louis II, (825 - 875), Holy Roman Emperor (sole ruler 855 - 875), eldest son of the emperor Lothair I, became the designated king of Italy in 839, and taking up his residence in that country was crowned king at Rome by Pope Sergius II on June 15, 844.<br />
 <br />
He at once preferred a claim to the rights of an emperor in the city, which claim was decisively rejected; but in 850 he was crowned joint emperor at Rome by Pope Leo IV, and soon afterwards married his cousin, Engelberga, a daughter of King Louis the German, and undertook the independent government of Italy. He took the field against the Saracens; quashed some accusations against Pope Leo; held a Diet at Pavia; and on the death of his father in September 855 became sole emperor.<br />
 <br />
The division of Lothair's dominions, by which he obtained no territory outside Italy, aroused his discontent, and in 857 he allied himself with Louis the German against his own brother Lothair, King of Lotharingia, and King Charles the Bald. But after Louis had secured the election of Pope Nicholas I in 858, he became reconciled with his brother, and received some lands south of the Jura mountains in return for assistance given to Lothair in his efforts to obtain a divorce from his wife, Teutberga.<br />
 <br />
In 863, on the death of his brother Charles, Louis received the kingdom of Provence, and in 864 came into collision with Pope Nicholas I over his brother's divorce. The archbishops, who had been deposed by Nicholas for proclaiming this marriage invalid, obtained the support of the emperor, who reached Rome with an army in February 864; but, having been seized with fever, he made peace with the pope and left the city.<br />
 <br />
In his efforts to restore order in Italy, Louis met with considerable success both against the turbulent princes of the peninsula and against the Saracens who were ravaging southern Italy. In 866 he routed these invaders, but could not follow up his successes owing to the lack of a fleet. So in 869 he made an alliance with the eastern emperor, Basil I, who sent him some ships to assist in the capture of Ban, the headquarters of the Saracens, which succumbed in 871.<br />
 <br />
Meanwhile his brother Lothair had died in 869, and owing to his detention in southern Italy, Louis failed to prevent the partition of Lotharingia between Louis the German and Charles the Bald. Some jealousy between Louis and Basil followed the victory at Ban, and in reply to an insult from the eastern emperor Louis attempted to justify his right to the title "emperor of the Romans." He had withdrawn into Benevento to prepare for a further campaign when he was treacherously attacked in his palace, robbed and imprisoned by Adeichis, prince of Benevento, in August 871. The landing of fresh bands of Saracens compelled Adeichis to release his prisoner a month later, and Louis was forced to swear he would take no revenge for this injury, nor ever enter Benevento with an army. Returning to Rome, he was released from his oath, and was crowned a second time as emperor by Pope Adrian II on May 18, 872.<br />
 <br />
Then Louis won further successes against the Saracens, who were driven from Capua, but the attempts of the emperor to punish Adelchis were not very successful. Returning to northern Italy, he died, somewhere in the province of Brescia, on August 12, 875, and was buried in the church of St Ambrose at Milan, having named as his successor in Italy his cousin Carloman, son of Louis the German.<br />

have a birth date of 26 December 1883, but unfortunately I forgot to note its<br />

my records and get back to you. There are a number of people researching this<br />
family including Edd Sinnett who posts to various boards frequently. There is<br />
also a very extensive descendant list for this family at Bill's Blog -<br />

Robert Fitzhamon (died March 1107) was Lord of Gloucester and the conqueror of Glamorgan.<br />
 <br />
He was a cousin of William the Conqueror, although the details of his descent from the Norman dukes is uncertain. His family held the lordships of Torigny, Creully, Mézy, and Evrecy in Normandy.<br />
 <br />
Robert probably did not fight at Hastings, and does not appear in the Domesday Book, although some relatives may. He first comes to prominence as a supporter of William Rufus during the Rebellion of 1088. After the revolt failed he was rewarded with great estates in Gloucestershire and elsewhere. Some of these had belonged to the late Queen Matilda, and were supposed to be inherited by Rufus's younger brother Henry (the future Henry I); nevertheless Fitzhamon remained on good terms with Henry.<br />
 <br />
The chronology of Fitzhamon's conquest of Glamorgan is uncertain, but it probably took place in the decades after he received Gloucester.<br />

Legend has it that Robert had ominous dreams in the days before Rufus' fatal hunting expedition, which postponed but did not prevent the outing. He was one of the first to gather in tears around Rufus' corpse, and he used his cloak to cover the late king's body on its journey to be buried in Winchester. How much of these stories are the invention of later days is unknown.<br />
 <br />
In any case Fitzhamon proved as loyal to Henry I as he had been to his predecessor, remaining on Henry's side in the several open conflicts with Henry's brother Robert Curthose. He was one of the three barons who negotiated the 1101 truce between Henry I and Robert Curthose.<br />
 <br />
In 1105 he went to Normandy and was captured while fighting near his ancestral estates near Bayeux. This was one of the reasons Henry crossed the channel with a substantial force later that year. Fitzhamon was freed, and joined Henry's campaign, which proceeded to besiege Falaise. There Fitzhamon was severely injured in the head; although he lived two more years he was never the same mentally.<br />
 <br />
Fitzhamon married Sibyl, daughter of Roger of Montgomery, 1st Earl of Shrewsbury, and Mabel of Bêlleme, by whom he probably only had one child, Mabel, who inherited his great estates and married Robert of Gloucester. Fitzhamon's Gloucestershire property became the nucleus of the Earldom of Gloucester later given to his son-in-law.<br />

"Le Bel" (The Fair), Comte d'Anjou, Duc de Normandie.<br />
On Henry I death in 1135, he claimed the duchy of Normandie, conquering it in 1144.<br />
He hold the duchy, with that of Anjou, until granting them to his son Henry.<br />
Geoffrey was the original Plantaganet, so named by his companions for the broom corn he wore on his person.<br />
It is through Geoffrey that the Plantaganet line from France was brought into the British royalty (see the lineage of the Counts of Anjou elsewhere). He died in 1151. After Geoffrey's death Matilda lived in Normandy, charitable and respected. Matilda died in 1167. Geoffrey was succeeded by his eldest son, Henry.<br />
 <br />
 <br />
From Wikipedia<br />
 <br />
Geoffrey V (August 24, 1113 - September 7, 1151), Count of Anjou and Maine, and later Duke of Normandy, called Le Bel ("The Fair") or "Geoffrey Plantagenet", was the father of King Henry II of England, and thus the forefather of the Plantagenet dynasty of English kings.<br />
 <br />
Geoffrey was the eldest son of Fulk, Count of Anjou and King-Consort of Jerusalem. Geoffrey's mother was Eremburge of La Flèche, heiress of Maine. Geoffrey received his nickname for the sprig of broom (= genêt plant, in French) he wore in his hat as a badge. In 1127, at Le Mans, at the age of 15 he married Empress Matilda, the daughter and heiress of King Henry I of England, by his first wife, Edith of Scotland and widow of Henry V, Holy Roman Emperor. The marriage was meant to seal a peace between England/Normandy and Anjou. She was eleven years older than Geoffrey, and their marriage was a stormy one, but she survived him.<br />
 <br />
The year after the marriage Geoffrey's father left for Jerusalem (where he was to become king), leaving Geoffrey behind as count of Anjou. Chroniclers describe Geoffrey as handsome, red-headed, jovial, and a great warrior; however, Ralph of Diceto alleges that his charm concealed his cold and selfish character.<br />
 <br />
When King Henry I died in 1135, Matilda at once entered Normandy to claim her inheritance. The border districts submitted to her, but England chose her cousin Stephen of Blois for its king, and Normandy soon followed suit. The following year, Geoffrey gave Ambrieres, Gorron, and Chatilon-sur-Colmont to Juhel de Mayenne, on condition that he help obtain the inheritance of Geoffrey's wife. In 1139 Matilda landed in England with 140 knights, where she was besieged at Arundel Castle by King Stephen. In the "Anarchy" which ensued, Stephen was captured at Lincoln in February, 1141, and imprisoned at Bristol. A legatine council of the English church held at Winchester in April 1141 declared Stephen deposed and proclaimed Matilda "Lady of the English". Stephen was subsequently released from prison and had himself recrowned on the anniversary of his first coronation.<br />
 <br />
During 1142 and 1143, Geoffrey secured all of Normandy west and south of the Seine, and, on 14 January, 1444, he crossed the Seine and entered Rouen. He assumed the title of Duke of Normandy in the summer of 1144. In 1144, he founded an Augustine priory at Chateau-l'Ermitage in Anjou. Geoffrey held the duchy until 1149, when he and Matilda conjointly ceded it to their son, Henry, which cession was formally ratified by King Louis VII of France the following year.<br />
 <br />
Geoffrey also put down three baronial rebellions in Anjou, in 1129, 1135, and 1145-1151. The threat of rebellion slowed his progress in Normandy, and is one reason he could not intervene in England. In 1153, the Treaty of Westminster allowed Stephen should remain King of England for life and that Henry, the son of Geoffrey and Matilda should succeed him.<br />
 <br />
At Château-du-Loir, Geoffrey died suddenly on September 7, 1151, still a young man. He was buried at St. Julien's in Le Mans France. Geoffrey and Matilda's children were:<br />
   1. Henry II of England (1133-1189)<br />
   2. Geoffrey, Count of Nantes (1134-1158)<br />
   3. William, Count of Poitiers (1136-1164)<br />
 <br />
Geoffrey also had illegitimate children by an unknown mistress (or mistresses): Hamelin; Emme, who married Dafydd Ab Owain Gwynedd, Prince of North Wales; and Mary, (1181-1216) who became a nun and Abbess of Shaftesbury and who may be the poetess Marie de France.<br />
 <br />
The first reference to Norman heraldry was in 1128, when Henry I of England knighted his son-in-law Geoffrey and granted him a badge of gold lions (or leopards) on a blue background. (A gold lion may already have been Henry's own badge.) Henry II used two gold lions and two lions on a red background are still part of the arms of Normandy. Henry's son, Richard I, added a third lion to distinguish the arms of England.<br />
