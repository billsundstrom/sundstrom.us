<h2>Notes</h2>
Elizabeth Ann WELLS
<p>
<a name ="I022340"><b>[I022340]</b></a><br />
PARYSEK, Elizabeth (Liddy) Ann-- departed this life on November 4, 2002. Born in Washington, D.C. August 27, 1940 to a Navy family, she lived in various places all over the country until moving to Santa Clara in 1954. She has since considered it to be her home town. She is survived by her husband of 32 years, Joseph H. Parysek, and their children: Michael James Parysek (Peggy), Amy Katherine Kelley (Reggie), Ellen Rebecca Rosbrugh (Daniel), Michael Joseph Parysek, Karen Doris Jean Lycett, Linda Renee Cooper (Michael), David Henry Parysek (Barbara), Timothy Paul Parysek (Shirley), 17 grandchildren and 7 great-grandchildren.<br>
Liddy worked at Kaiser Santa Clara for over 25 years, and volunteered and worked for the Santa Clara School District as a substitute librarian for several years. She was an active member of the Santa Clara Church of the Nazarene. Liddy enjoyed gardening, reading, crochet, travel and spending time with family and friends.<br>
After battling breast cancer in 1999 she was again diagnosed with liver cancer in 2001; just a month before her daughters wedding. Despite the bleak outlook, she never let it get her down. She made her time count. Early on, she decided that quality was more important than quantity; and her positive attitude allowed her both.<br>
She astounded her doctors by outliving their expectations by more than a year, and used that time to make as many good memories for those who knew and loved her. She was "mom" to many, her generous spirit touched the lives of all who knew her, and she will be greatly missed.<br>
A memorial service will be held on Saturday, November 9th at Central Church of the Nazarene, 3275 Williams Rd., in San Jose at 1:00 p.m. <br>
