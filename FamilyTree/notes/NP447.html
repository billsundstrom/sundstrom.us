<h2>Notes</h2>
Erik REFILSSON
<p>
<a name ="I007802"><b>[I007802]</b></a><br />
Erik Refilsson was a Swedish king of the House of Munsö. According to Hervarar saga, he succeeded his uncle Erik Björnsson as the king of Sweden. He was succeeded by his cousins Anund Uppsale and Björn at Hauge.<br>
<br>
According to Hervarar saga, he was a powerful warlord and a rich king: á tók rı́kit Eirı́kr, sonr Refils; hann var mikill hermađr ok allrı́kr konungr.<br>
<br>
Apparently, he was such a successful king that Rimbert relates that at Ansgar's second visit in Birka it was suggested among the people that Erik (Erik who preceded Björn) was to be elevated to god instead of the new god.<br>

CHARLES (CHARLIE) REIACH SR. December 14, 1907 - October 19, 2003 With deep sadness we announce the passing of our dear father and grandfather, Charlie Reiach, at the age of 95 years. Charlie passed away peacefully at Riverview Health Centre, in the early morning hours of October 19, 2003 Charlie will be greatly missed by his son Charles of Kenora, ON; daughter Heather and son-in-law Don Richards of Winnipeg; and granddaughters, Leslie Hudson (Gord) and Beverly Simpson (Craig) of Winnipeg. Charlie was predeceased by his wife Hazel (nee Scurfield) to whom he was married for 60 years, as well as brothers, James, William and Alexander. Charlie was born in Aberdeen, Scotland. At 18 years of age he obtained employment as a fur trader with The Hudsons Bay Co. and emigrated to Canada. Charlie spent many years in Northern Canada, at posts such as Fond du Lac, Tuktoyaktuk, Aklavik and Coppermine. The stories he had of those days were unending and many have listened intently to his adventures. He met Hazel while on furlough in Winnipeg in 1937 and after a winter in Scotland returned to marry her in the spring of 1938. In 1945 the family moved to the Red Lake District of Ontario where Charlie was manager of the Hudsons Bay Store at McKenzie Island and later Madsen. Charlie retired in 1972, after 46 years with The Bay. After retirement, Charlie and Hazel moved first to Winnipeg and later to Hazels home town of Clearwater, MB, where they spent many happy years. More recently, Charlie lived at Fred Douglas Place, where he was well known for enjoying a game of bridge or bingo. With failing health, Charlie took up residence at Riverview Health Centre in July 2002. Charlie was a devoted father and grandfather. He was proud of his familys successes and valued a good education. He was a gentle man, loving life, and complaining little. He was a favourite of many nieces and nephews and will be fondly remembered by them. He took pleasure in the simple things in life: the success of his potato crop, flying a kite with his granddaughters, and wandering the paths of his sons island at Lake of the Woods. A memorial service will be held on Thursday, October 23 at 1:30 p.m. in Thomson Funeral Chapels, 669 Broadway with Dr. A. M. Watts officiating. Our appreciation is extended to the staff of 2 West at Riverview Health Centre for their compassion and care. <br>
