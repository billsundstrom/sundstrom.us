Patience KEMP
<p>
<a name ="I003904"><b>[I003904]</b></a><br />
May have been daughter of Wm. Kemp, Jr and Patience (Thacher) Partridge but the time frames look wrong for this without more date information.<br>
<br>
A discussion found online and seems apropos:<br>
<br>
Who is Patience Kemp and what is Her Heritage?<br>
Both articles above deal with this issue. This is a direct quote from t he conclusion of the second one. It has more detail in the citation, if you desire it.<br>
<br>
"(1) Rev. Thomas Thacher and Elizabeth Partridge, his wife, had no daughter, Patience Thacher.<br>
(2) Elizabeth Partridge, dau. of Rev. Ralph Partridge, married 1st William Kemp, by whom she had a daughter, Patience Kemp, b. ________. William Kemp d. previous to 23 Sep 1641, and hence subsequent to this date h is widow was free to contract a second marriage; which in fact, she did, by marrying on 11 May 1643, Rev. Thomas Thacher, who subsequently, 2 January 1644 -5, became the minister at Weymouth, MA, and remained the re in that capacity until subsequent to the death, on 2 Jun 1664, of Elizabeth partridge h is wife. Rev. Thomas Thacher was born in England 1 May 1 620, and in 1643 w as presumably about the same age as Elizabeth Partridge, who like himself, was born in England (date of birth unknown), and ca me to this country 17 Nov 1636 with her father. Elizabeth Partridge, so on after her coming to this country, married first William Kemp, who h ad reached this country, previous to her arrival, 3 Jun 1635, on the ship James. Soon after h is marriage William Kemp died, leaving but one child, Patience Kemp, and not leaving a son William Kemp, 2d, who never in reality existed at all. Elizabeth Partridge-Kemp, widow of the only William Kemp, shortly after her first husband's death, married on 11 May 164 3, Rev. Thomas Thacher, and her daughter by her first husband, Patience Kemp, became the step-daughter of Rev. Thomas Thacher, and was received in to his family, and brought up by him, and married from his home in Weymouth, MA, on 9 (or 16) De c. 1660, to Samuel Saberry (Seabury), of Duxbury, Plymouth, MN.<br>
<br>
(3) Samuel Seabury did NOT marry Patience Kemp, dau. of William Kemp, 2 d, (who never existed in the flesh), and of Patience Thacher (who also never existed), but married Patience Kemp, dau. of William Kemp, 1st, (the only William Kemp), and Elizabeth Partridge, his wife, he being her first husband.<br>
<br>
(4) William Kemp, 2d, and Patience Thacher are two mythical individuals, summoned into existence by early genealogists, in order that by their marriage they could give birth to a Patience Kemp, who was subsequently to marry Samuel Seabury. It was known beyond doubt that Samuel Seabury did marry a Patience Kemp, and so these hypothetical parents were manufactured for her."<br>
<br>
This situation is described in more detail (a seven page essay and quotation of dozens of sources from all angles) in the New York Genealogic al and Biographical News, Vol. 35, 1904, p. 101-107, with the same conclusion.<br>
