<p>
<a name ="I018243"><b>[I018243]</b></a><br />
Robert "Bob" John Crabtree Feb. 18, 1927~April 4, 2009 Resident of Walnut Creek Bob, 82, passed away Saturday evening in his sleep after a long illness. He is survived by his wife, Elva, their children Ann, Paul, and Lois, and their children's spouses David, Robin, and Alan. Bob also leaves nine grandchildren, ten great-grand-children, and two sisters, Faith and Marilyn. Bob was raised in Chicago, IL, one of seven siblings. After serving in the Navy during World War II, Bob married his wife of 60 years, Elva McElroy Crabtree. In his early years, Bob and his brothers formed Cardinal Homes, a construction company. Together they built countless houses throughout Fresno, Sacramento, and the Bay Area. Later, Bob formed his own business, continuing in the legacy left by his father's contractor's license. Bob built many "spec" homes in the East Bay Area with his son, friends, and family members. Bob and Elva moved to the Diablo Valley in 1965. They and their children all know the Lord Jesus Christ as their savior. Bob and Elva have faithfully served the Lord through the ministry of NorthCreek Church for more than 40 years. Many people have been touched by their generosity and faithful service. Though Bob will be missed, we rejoice that he is now with Jesus. We are comforted by this Bible verse - "For to me, to live is Christ, to die is gain!" Philippians 1:21. A memorial service will be held this Saturday, April 11, 11am at NorthCreek Church, 2303 Ygnacio Valley Road, Walnut Creek, CA 94598. In lieu of gifts, please donate in memory of Bob to the "NorthCreek Church Building Fund".<br>

YARMOUTH PORT - Chick Craig , well-known professional photographer, gently departed from this world on Monday, Jan. 19, 2015. <br>
Chick had a distinguished career. He left Northfield Mount Herman School just before he was due to graduate and enlisted in the U.S Army to help defend his country. He proudly served as a staff sergeant and headed a team of sharp shooters under General Patten in World War II. He was awarded two Purple Hearts, an Oak Leaf Cluster, a Bronze Star and several other medals and awards. <br>
Chick owned and operated Craig Studio of Photography and Craig Studio Galleries for 30 years in East Dennis and owned and operated The Color Lab (development processing center) for 10 years in Hyannis while still running his two other businesses. <br>
Chick was "The Photographer" on Cape Cod for weddings, special events, portraits, family groups and high school graduation photos, as well as their sports and yearbook pictures. If your photo said "Photo by Craig " on it, you had the best! Chick was the photographer of the stars for the Cape Playhouse for 47 years! He photographed everything at the Cape Playhouse during these years, including all of Helen Pond and Herbert Senn sets, as well as all their sets for the operas, and the Nutcracker sets H&H designed. Chick was the photographer for the big business on the Cape. He photographed all the stars at the Cape Cod Melody Tent for many years, covered the Merchant Marine Academy needs and did special assignments for Dow Chemical and for Cain's Food Products for their national commercial advertising. Several of his photos were bought by Time Magazine for publication. <br>
Some of the biggest highlights in Chick's career were the special assignment photography he did for President John F. Kennedy, as well as special assignments for Jacqueline Kennedy; Mr. Dave Thomas, owner of Wendy's; and many political, entertainment celebrities and sports figures. Chick covered special assignments with photography and videography for Cape Cod's largest employer, Cape Cod Healthcare. He loved playing golf and enjoyed his duties as trustee and then trustee emeritus for The Raymond Moore Foundation. <br>
In addition to wielding a camera, Chick also worked evenings at Cape Cod Hospital in the emergency room for five years as a corpsman while still running his businesses. He later became the Auction House photographer for Robert Eldred in Dennis for many years. Chick was chairman of building and grounds for The Raymond Moore Foundation for 11 years. Under his direction, they re-built the Playhouse Restaurant, the Cape Cod Center for the Arts and the Cooperage, put new staging in the Playhouse and he was the "on-call 24 hours a day" guy for any fire or emergency. Chick was a trustee and the recording secretary for the Raymond Moore Foundation for 11 years. He was also chairman of the Old Kings Highway Historic Committee in Dennis for several years. <br>
Chick leaves behind his beloved wife of 23 years, Reverend Nancy J. Wurlitzer- Craig , and her three grown children, Geoffrey and wife MaryPat Wurlitzer, Gregory Wurlitzer and Joanne Wurlitzer Trombly. He was proud to be a grandfather to their children, five granddaughters and one grandson. <br>
A private graveside service with Military honors will be held at the Massachusetts National Cemetery at a later date. <br>
The family would like to give special thanks to Liberty Commons Nursing & Rehab Center in Chatham for the compassionate care and attention he received. <br>

Lucy Catherine CRAIG
<p>
<a name ="I021470"><b>[I021470]</b></a><br />
Mrs. J. H. Webster of Cambridge: passed away after a lingering illness on Wednesday morning, 5th inst. in the 58th year of her age. She leaves a husband and two children to mourn the loss of a faithful loving wife and a kind and christian mother. During her illness, which was of a very distressing nature, she exhibited remarkable patience and fortitude, and an implicit trust in the Savior, whom she loved, and without a regret, except for the loved ones left behind, she passed away without a struggle to the rest beyond. The funeral took place on Friday and although the day was very unpleasant there was a large attendance. The sermon was preached by Rev E.O. Read, Rev Mr. Freeman, and Rev Mr. Hawley (Presbyterian) were in attendance and took part in the service. Mrs. Webster was the daughter of the late William Craig, of Brooklyn St., Cornwallis, who some twenty years ago preceded his daughter to the better land. Mrs. Webster was born at Morristown, Aylesford, in a house which her father, then a young man, built with his own hands about seventy years ago, in what was then an almost unbroken forest. This house, which is one of the oldest in the county, is still occupied, and is the comfortable home of Mr. Robert Nichols. In this house and on this farm in Morristown Mr. and Mrs. Craig raised a family of eight children, in which this death makes the first break. The venerable mother still lives, and at the advanced age of 92 years and 8 months was able to attend the funeral of her daughter. In 1857 Mr. Craig, with his family, removed from Morristown to Brooklyn Street, Cornwallis, and in 1860 Miss Catherine Craig was united in marriage to Mr. John H. Webster, of Cambridge, with whom she resided until her death. By honest toil and econmy, and good luck that generally goes with these characteristics, Mr. and Mrs. Webster, although commencing with but little, soon became forehanded, and Mr. W. has for a number of years been reckoned among our successful men. Last summer, the son, Mr. J.G. Webster married, and his father gave him the homestead, and built a new house near the station for a home for himself and wife, in which they hoped to spend a number of quiet years of rest in their old age. But an all-wise Providence has disarranged their plans, and Mr. Webster is left alone.<br>
