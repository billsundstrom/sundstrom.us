There was a very pretty wedding at St. Aloyslus' church yesterday morning at 11 o'clock when Charles J. Mahaney and Miss Maud Dashney were united in marriage by Rev. J. J. McGrath. The bride was dressed in a blue tailor made gown and carried white carnations. Miss Lula La May, who attended the bride, wore a grey suit, and carried pink carnations. H. J. Mack was groomsman. A wedding dinner was served at the home of the bride's mother, Mrs. Peter Dashney, No. 249 Seymour street, the immediate relatives of the family being present. The bride received many beautiful presents. The bride and groom disappeared early in the evening, the groom wearing tne groomsman's overcoat which was several sizes to small for him and the bride, as near as could be learned, was without wraps. After a long search an alarm was sent to the City hall to have the bell rung for lost children but they were finally located at 195 Seymour street before this became necessary. This was a great relief to the groomsman, who was thinking of getting out a warrant for the loss of his coat. <br>
