John F. SCHMIDT
<p>
<a name ="I076441"><b>[I076441]</b></a><br />
Among the early settlers of the Bloomfield community wereJohn and Dorathea (Koch) Schmidt both having immigrated to this country from the old country. John was born December 20, 1856 at Luhrsdorf, Holstein, Germany and came to the United States while a young man and settled in Clinton County, Iowa. Dorathea was born April 12, 1855 1t Messsunde, Holstein, Germany and immigrated to this country in 1882 and married John at Maquoketa, Iowa that same year. They farmed in several states before coming and settling northeast of Bloomfield in 1902. John and Dorathea retired to Bloomfield in the ear 1918. They were the parents of eight children: Carl, Albert, Bertha, Amanda, Frieda, Ella, Henry and John.<br>
Mr. and Mrs. Schmidt experienced many of the hardships of the pioneer days. The walking plow and cultivator were familiar pieces of equipment during those days of non-motorized equipment. A team of horses provided the power necessary to farm and also provided transportation for the family by being hitched to a wagon, buggy or sled. While farming in Kansas prior to their moving to Nebraska, the Schmidt family endured a severe Blizzard and in order to save their lives of the team of horses for lack of a adequate barn , it was necessary to bring them into the house. When relating this event many times later, they started that apparently the horses sensed the seriousness of the storm and remained very calm and tranquil.<br>
Entertainment included visiting the neighbors as well as with friends at church. Mrs. Schmidt often told how during the long winter months, she would push the dinning room table to the wall and while her husband played the accordion, she would take turns dancing with the children. Occasionally Square dances in the neighborhood homes also provided entertainment and a chance to socialize. Due to financial circumstances and raising a large family, Mr. and Mrs. Schmidt were never able to return to Germany to visit the relatives there.<br>
While residing in Bloomfield Mr. and Mrs. Schmidt were involved in community affairs and were members of the First Trinity Lutheran Church. John passed away July 27, 1924 at the age of 67 years, Dorathea passed away December 1, 1929 at the age 74 years<br>
