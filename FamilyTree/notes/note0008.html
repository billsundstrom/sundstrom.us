MARGARET ATWOOD<br />
Margaret Dorothy Killam Atwood Mother, dietitian, outdoorswoman. Born June 8, 1909, in Kinsman's Corners, N.S. Died Dec. 30, 2006, in Toronto, of natural causes, aged 97.<br />
Someone said to me recently, "You must have had an unusual mother." True enough.<br />
Margaret Killam was born in 1909 in the Annapolis Valley of Nova Scotia. Her father was a country doctor, and she grew up as a socially shy but physically brave tomboy. Unlike her academically brilliant sister, Kae, she was not a natural student. Her father refused to send her to university because she was "frivolous," so she taught school, saved the money for her own fees, and won a college scholarship, just to show she could.<br />
In 1935, she married Carl Atwood, who'd fallen in love with the sight of her sliding down a banister. They spent their honeymoon canoeing down the Saint John River in New Brunswick, then headed for northern Quebec, where my father ran an insect research station. They lived in tents, then in a cabin built by my father, where my mother raised two small children without benefit of electricity or running water. The winter months were spent in Ottawa, but my mother preferred the bush. She hated hats, tea parties, and housework - in the woods she "just swept the dirt out the door" - and loved swimming in the cold northern lakes and working in the vegetable garden where they grew much of their food. When we ran short, my mother would go down to the end of the dock and throw in a line for pickerel.<br />
In 1945, my parents moved to Sault Ste. Marie, Ont.; my father established the insect lab there. We spent the warmer months in yet another cabin on the shore of Lake Superior. Our mother set up a mammoth berry-preserving operation, and we were set to picking blueberries at a cent a cup. She did not believe in waste or overspending.<br />
Our father was frequently away on insect-collecting trips, and one of my Lake Superior memories is of my mother waving a broom and yelling "Scat!" to chase away a hungry bear that had just trashed our food cache.<br />
After moving to Toronto, where my father taught zoology at the University of Toronto, my parents acquired a third child, after which they took up Scottish country dancing. This wasn't enough for my mother: She added ice dancing to her list of sports, and kept it up until she was 75. When she was 84, she casually informed me that it was time for her to stop climbing up on the roof to get the leaves out of the eaves troughs. "You've been doing what?" I said. She gave me the same stubborn but pleased look she had when, forbidden to shovel snow, she'd have the driveway cleared before you could get over.<br />
My mother loved to read aloud: All three of her children got the benefit. She was a hilarious storyteller and an alarming mimic, although, unlike her sister Joyce Barkhouse, the children's author, she had no interest in writing. She composed only one poem in her life: It was about flying, the kind with wings, a feat she never accomplished.<br />
She was a believer in doing what you thought was right, seeing things through, buttoning your lip when advisable, and enjoying life as much as possible. She was a permissive mother in many ways - mud pies, frogs in jars, and messy paint held no terrors for her - but she discouraged complaining: Even in her last few years, when she was blind and bedridden, she never did it herself.<br />
Shortly before she died, my Aunt Joyce reminded her - in one of her faithful weekly letters - of how she used to handle the blizzards "back home" in Nova Scotia. "Let's go out and fight the storm!" my mother would say. That's one image her many friends will retain of her: M.D.K.A., striding headfirst into the wind, for the joy that was in it.<br />
Writer Margaret Atwood is the daughter of M.D.K.A.<br />

Henry IV (November 11, 1050 - August 7, 1106) was King of Germany from1056 and Emperor from 1084, until his abdication in 1105. He was thethird emperor of the Salian dynasty.<br />
 <br />
Henry was the eldest son of the Emperor Henry III, by his second wife Agnes de Poitiers, and was probably born at the royal palace at Goslar. His christening was delayed until the following Easter so that Abbot Hugh of Cluny could be one of his godparents. But even before that, at his Christmas court Henry III induced the attending nobles to promise to be faithful to his son. Three years later, still anxious to insure the succession, Henry III had a larger assembly of nobles elect the young Henry as his successor, and then, on July 17, 1054, had him crowned as king by Archbishop Herman of Cologne. Thus when Henry III unexpectedly died in 1056, the accession of the 6-year-old Henry IV was not opposed. The dowager Empress Agnes acted as regent. Henry's reign was marked by efforts to consolidate Imperial power. In reality, however, it was a careful balancing act between maintaining the loyalty of the nobility and the support of the pope. Henry jeopardized both when, in 1075, his insistence on the right of a secular ruler to invest, i.e., to place in office, members of the clergy, especially bishops, began the conflict known as the Investiture Controversy. In the same year he defeated a rebellion of Saxons in the First Battle of Langensalza. Pope Gregory VII excommunicated Henry on February 22, 1076. Gregory, on his way to a diet at Augsburg, and hearing that Henry was approaching, took refuge in the castle of Canossa (near Reggio Emilia), belonging to Matilda, Countess of Tuscany. Henry's intent, however, was to perform the penance required to lift his excommunication, and ensure his continued rule. He stood for three days, January 25 to January 27, 1077, outside the gate at Canossa, begging the pope to rescind the sentence (though not, as is often stated, in bare shirt with no food or shelter). The Pope lifted the excommunication, imposing a vow to comply with certain conditions, which Henry soon violated.<br />
 <br />
In his last years Henry faced rebellions from his eldest son and his wife. He died at Liège in 1106, "like one falling asleep", after nine days of illness. He was interred next to his father at Speyer.<br />
 <br />
Marriages<br />
 <br />
In 1055 Henry was betrothed to Bertha of Maurienne, daughter of Count Otto of Savoy. They were married in June 1066. In 1068 he attempted to divorce her, but was unable and Bertha was restored as Empress a year later. She died on December 27, 1086 and was buried at the cathedral of Speyer. Their children were:<br />
   1. Agnes of Germany (born 1072/1073), married Frederick I von Staufen, Duke of Swabia.<br />
   2. Conrad (February 12, 1074-July 27, 1101)<br />
   3. Adelaide, died in infancy<br />
   4. Henry, died in infancy<br />
   5. Henry (1086)<br />
 <br />
In 1089 Henry married Eupraxia of Kiev, the only daughter of Vsevolod I, Prince of Kiev, and sister to his son Vladimir Monomakh  (1053 -- May 19, 1125), prince of Kievan Rus. She assumed the name "Adelaide" upon her coronation. In 1094 she joined a rebellion against him, accusing Henry of holding her prisoner; of forcing her to participate in orgies; and attempting a black mass on her naked body.<br />

From the 1870 Census from White  Hempfield, Westmoreland, PA:<br />
John C Brinker, age 7 (b.1862) in PA; head of houshold Samuel (abt 1826) and Almira (abt 1841) Brinker with siblings of James M. (abt 1858) and Calvin R. (abt 1860).  Research in Greensburg church records and the 1880 census showed that the family called themselves Bricker, a common variation of Brinker.  John is listed as 18 years old in the 1880 census.  I found baptismal records for all the childen except John.<br />
 <br />
1895 Iowa Census shows John C. Brinker, age 33 born in PA, in Van Buren, Kokuk County.<br />
 <br />
Family stories from his first family imply that he may have run away from family at a very early age.<br />
Both families have other stories that he was an adopted orphan.  He was a bit deceptive about the facts around his background.<br />
It is said that there was detecive's report, paid for by wife one, that found he lived with a farm family on the Illinois side of the quad-city area at age 16.  He knew nothing about farming by was very adept at machinery repair.<br />
Stories of origins of his parents place them both in Northern Holland and Germany.<br />
His marriage license states that he was born in Canada.  Most of the time he reported his birthplace as Johnstown, PA.  This may have been another deception.<br />
A side note is that only one Brinker (Henry) was declared missing in the great Johnstown flood of 1889, when more than 2000 perished.<br />
His parents names came from the marriage license to Hannah Day and his death certificate with the informant being his son, Charles.<br />
Most of the family records that existed and had not been searched were destroyed in the 1998 tornado at St. Peter, MN.<br />
 <br />
A story from Elinor and Vernon Sundstrom, says that Mary Brinker stopped to visit an aunt, the child of John Brinker, around Wessington Springs, SD, in September 1947.<br />

There seems to be several versions of Rollo (Robert)'s parentage. Someshow his parents to be Robert de Harcourt and Colede d' Argouges. Othersshow Anchetil de Harcourt and Eva de Braose as parents. As far asgenerational dates are concerned, the most likely seems to be Anchetil deHarcourt and Eva de Braose, since Robert de Harcourt and Colede d'Argouges were contemporaries of William the Conqueror and would have beenin their senior years when Rollo would have been born. Therefore, thelikelihood of another generation in between is logical.<br />

Henry III (October 29, 1017 - October 5, 1056) was a member of the Salian(sometimes Franconian) dynasty of Holy Roman Emperors. He became king ofGermany upon the death of his father, the emperor Conrad II on June 4,1039. He was crowned emperor by Pope Clement II in 1046.<br />
 <br />
Henry was married in 1036 to Canute the Great's daughter Gunhilda, born around 1020. Early on Henry's father emperor Conrad II had arranged fief with Canute to have him rule over some parts of northern Germany and in turn to have their children get married. After the marriage took place at the earliest legal age, Gunhilda died just two years later at the Adriatic Coast on an imperial journey.<br />
 <br />
Henry was re-married in 1043 to Agnes de Poitiers, daughter of duke of William V of Aquitaine. They had a son Henry IV, Holy Roman Emperor and a daughter, Judith of Swabia.<br />
 <br />
In 1046 Henry held royal/imperial courts at Merseburg and Meissen, where he ended the strife between the Dux Bomeraniorum, the duke Bratislaw of Bohemia and Casimir I of Poland. This is one of the earliest, or perhaps the earliest, recording of the name of Pomerania.<br />
 <br />
Henry's reign as emperor was marked by his attempts to reform the Church, but also by his use of lay investiture to further his religious and political goals. This policy was continued by his son and successor, Henry IV, and eventually lead to the imperial-papal conflict known as the Investiture Controversy.<br />

Conrad II, Holy Roman Emperor<br />
From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia.<br />
 <br />
Conrad II (c. 990 - June 4, 1039) was the son of Count Henry of Speyer and Adelheid of Alsace. He was elected king in 1024 and crowned emperor of the Holy Roman Empire on March 26, 1027, the first member of the Salian Dynasty.<br />
 <br />
During his reign, he proved that the German monarchy had become a viable institution. Survival of the monarchy was no longer dependent on contracts between sovereign and territorial nobles.<br />
 <br />
Conrad grew up poor by the standards of the nobility and was raised by the bishop of Worms. He was reputed to be prudent and firm out of consciousness of deprivation. In 1016, he married Gisela of Swabia, a widowed duchess. Both parties claimed descent from Charlemagne and were thus distantly related. Strict canonists took exception to the marriage, and Emperor Henry II used these facts to force Conrad into temporary exile. They became reconciled, and upon Henry's death in 1024, Conrad appeared as a candidate before the electoral assembly of princes at Kamba in the Rhineland. He was elected by the majority and was crowned king in Mainz on September 8, 1024.<br />
 <br />
The Italian bishops paid homage at Conrad's court at Constance in June 1025, but lay princes sought to elect William III (V), Duke of Aquitaine, as king instead. However early in 1026 Conrad went to Milan, where archbishop Ariberto crowned him king of Italy. After overcoming some opposition of the towns Conrad reached Rome, where Pope John XIX crowned him emperor on Easter, 1027.<br />
 <br />
He formally confirmed the popular legal traditions of Saxony and issued new constitutions for Lombardy. In 1028 at Aachen he had his son Henry elected and anointed king of Germany. Henry married Cunigunde or Gunhilda, daughter of King Canute the Great of England, Denmark, Sweden, and Norway. This was an arrangement that Conrad had made many years ago, when he gave Canute the Great parts of northern Germany to administer. Henry, the later Emperor Henry III, became chief counsellor of his father.<br />
 <br />
Conrad campaigned against Poland in 1028 and forced Mieszko II, son and heir of Boleslaus I, to make peace and return land that Boleslaw I had conquered from the empire during his father's reign. At the death of Henry II the bold and rebellious Duke of Poland Mieszko II had tried to throw off vassalage, but then submitted and swore to be emperor Conrad's faithful vassal. Mieszko II quit being self-anointed king and returned to being duke of Poland.<br />
 <br />
When Rudolph III, King of Burgundy died on February 2, 1032, he bequeathed his kingdom, which combined two earlier kingdoms of Burgundy, to Conrad. Despite some opposition, the Burgundian and Provencal nobles paid homage to Conrad in Zürich in 1034. This kingdom of Burgundy, which under Conrad's successors would become known as the Kingdom of Arles, corresponded to most of the southeastern quarter of modern France and included western Switzerland, the Franche-Comté and Dauphiné. It did not include the smaller Duchy of Burgundy to the north, ruled by a cadet branch of the Capetian King of France. (Piecemeal over the next centuries most of the former Kingdom of Arles was incorporated into France - but King of Arles remained one of the Holy Roman Emperor's subsidiary titles until the dissolution of the Empire in 1806.)<br />
 <br />
Conrad upheld the rights of the valvassores (knights and burghers of the cities) of Italy against Archbishop Aribert of Milan and the local nobles. The nobles as vassal lords and the bishop had conspired to rescind rights from the burghers. With skillful diplomacy and luck Conrad restored order. He went on to southern Italy, to Salerno and Anversa and appointed Richer from Germany as abbot of Monte Cassino.<br />
 <br />
During the return trip to Germany an epidemic broke out amongs the troops. Conrad's daughter-in-law and stepson died. Conrad himself returned safely and held several important courts in Solothurn, Strasbourg and in Goslar. His son Henry was invested with the kingdom of Burgundy.<br />
 <br />
A year later in 1039 Conrad fell ill and died in Utrecht.<br />

As a resident of Leicestershire heowned in 1130 for a writ not to be impleaded of his lands or his heir.Sometime during the period 1133-48 as "Asketillus de Berges," he gavefour carucates of the land of Durton to the Abbot and Convent of St Maryat Carendon, the charter being witnessed by Robert, Earl of Leicester,and Ives de Harcourt. About 1145-47 Anschetil witnessed a charter on thepart of Roger, Earl of Warwick; incident to the marriage of the earl'sdaughter Agnes. He was dead in 1148 when his son William de Harcourt gaveland in Stanton-under-Bardon to Garendon Abbey pro anima patris mei.<br />
 <br />
From dates pertaining to Anschetil of Leicestershire, his sons, and his grandsons, it can be deduced that he was born about the decade 1080-1090. Hence, he was a contemporary of William, son of Robert the Strong, Seigneur of Harcourt in Normandy. This William is well known as Robert's heir and, in point of time, Anschetil could have been his brother. There is no mention of the Leicestershire Anschetil by the chroniclers of the Norman family, however, and his name has not been found in any document in which those of Robert the Strong, or his sons, occur. Possibly, Anschetil and William were first cousins - it may be speculated that Anschetil was a son of Robert's reputed borther II. vi. Ives; that he was named for I. Anschetil, father of this Ives, of Normandy; and this his own son Ives was given the name of the English Anschetil's father. The nomenclature and chronology (Anschetil of NOrmandy, probably born c 1020-1030; Ives of Normandy, probably born c 1060-1070; Anschetil of England, probably born c 1080-1090; Ives of England, probably born c 1100-10) are persuasive, but no proof can be cited.<br />
 <br />
Anschetil de Harcourt of Leichestershire married Agnes, who has not been otherwise identified, and left issue: II. i. Ives. ii. William, who occurs as a witness, with Richard de Harcourt the Templar, and as Guillemus filius Ansketilli, to the confirmation of c 1126-29 by Philip de Briouze to the Abbey of St Florent; gave a third part, and leased the remainder, of Stanton-under-Bardon to Garendon Abbey in 1148, with the assent of his brother Ives and their mother Agnes; joined in 1153-54, as senescaldus meus Willelmus de Harecurt, in a notification by William de Briouze to the Priory of Sele. iii. (perhaps) Robert, tentatively identified as the witness of that name to an agreement c 1124-30 between the brothers Payn, Robert, and Elias Foliot and the Abbot of Ramsey; and as the Robertus filus Anchetilli who occurs with Bishop Philip de Harcourt in a Bayeux document of 1147. iv. (perhaps) Beatrice, married Robert Bassett. [NEHGR "The Early Harcourts"; Lundie W. Barlow, CXVI:93-94]<br />

At eighty-five (sheʼll be eighty-six Feb. 4th) she has limited mobility.She can use a walker for short distances, but other than that - sheʼseither in a wheel chair or her recliner-type chair that elevates at theseat, to help her get up. Her hands are starting to show signs ofarthritis and her eye sight is growing dim, yet, even though her body isaging, sheʼs still a wide-eyed-child when it comes to her soul.<br />
With over a hundred and some ought grand-kids she manages to keep track of them all. And all year she sits and knits, spins and weaves some kind of Christmas magic into hats and scarves and baby blankets. And somehow, at Christmas, without even leaving her chair, she manages to have gifts for everyone. She has spent more time making gifts for others than many folks have been alive. She MUST be Mrs. Claus - or related in some kind-of-way, right?<br />
She watches, too. With dimming eyes and one finger at a time she taps at a lap top and - like a mother-hen - she watches her brood banter on face-book.<br />
Although confined physically, sheʼs a world traveler in her soul. Sit by her side and sheʼll take you places decades from here, with her stories. Like the first time she met the love of her life at Coney Island: Santa. No, just kidding - Henry Joseph DeVlaeminck. Sheʼll walk you through the depression and wade through life on a pig farm. Youʼll ride her words to school with horse and sleigh. Sheʼll tell of the trials and laughter of raising fourteen children - the birth of someand the loss of others.<br />
With a twinkle in her eye and a never fading smile, sheʼll tell of how she saw Jesus in a dream and how she prays for others.<br />
Her house in nothing fancy, but her Home is a mansion. Each day her house fills with family, including ex-husbands, ex-wives, ex-this and ex-that, once in you're IN. Iʼve said itʼs easier to get out of the mob than out of this family.  Sheʼs soft spoken, just above a whisper, but she can move an army of adoring children with a simple word.<br />
Maybe my mother-in-law isnʼt related in any way to Santa. BUT - she IS related to the Greatest Gift Giver of all. And she works for Him. And, maybe her family isnʼt anything like being in the mob with the Godfather and all that stuff. BUT - she is tight with God The Father.<br />
And I am honored to share her with you today. Her kids call her Ma, but everyone else - whether related or not - calls her Gramma Mary. So, if you need a family, you can join ours.<br />
Thanks for stopping by and as Gramma Mary would say; "Gramma misses you, come back and see me again."<br />
If you think you donʼt have a family or a parent to honor - think again, you do.<br />

Bibliographic Information: Partridge, George Henry, Partridge Genealogy, The<br />
Plimpton Press, Norwood, MA 1915 PARTRIDGE GENEALOGY<br />
DESCENDANTS OF GEORGE PARTRIDGE OF Duxbury, Plymouth, MNSSACHUSETTS<br />
 <br />
GEORGE PARTRIDGE, the first of the family in America, arrived at Duxbury,<br />
Mass., in or sometime prior to 1636. It is stated in Winsor's "History of<br />
Duxbury" that he came from the County of Kent in England.<br />
The first mention of his name upon the records of Plymouth County was in that year (1636), when he was granted five acres of land at Powder Point, with permission from the court to settle thereon. In the next two years and also in 1666, he received additional grants of land about Duxbury, amounting in all to about two hundred acres.<br />
Winsor styles him "one of the most respectable yeomanry of the colony." In<br />
1643 his name appears in a list of those able to bear arms. In 1646 he was constable. Of this office Winsor says: "This was an office of high trust and responsibility and none were elected to it but men of good standing."<br />
Later he was a "Surveyor of Highways" and a grand-jury man.<br />
He was either a private or a non-commissioned officer in Capt. Miles Standish's Company.<br />
He was one of the original purchasers of Middleborough.<br />
His will is recorded in Plymouth County Probate Records (Vol. 1, p. 225) and<br />
was dated June 26, 1682. An inventory of his estate was taken October 10,<br />
1695. So his death occurred between those two dates. His will was witnessed by two sons of Miles Standish, Alexander and Josiah, and reads as follows: "On ye 26th day of June in ye year of our Lord 1682. I George Partridge yeoman living in Duxborough being in sound mind and good and perfect remembrance praysed be ye Lord for it make & ordaine this my last will and testament in manner and form following first I commend my soul unto Almighty God my maker and Redeemer and my body I will that it be decently buryed and funerall charges paid together with all my just and lawful debts out of my estate.<br />

Aznar I Gaĺındez (?? - 839) was Count of Aragón from 809 to 820, succeeding Aureolo upon the latter's death. From his loss of Aragón in 820 until his death in 839, Aznar I was count of Cerdagne and Urgel.<br />
 <br />
Aznar I was the great-grandson of Galindo, probably head of the family that led the Frankish party in the region (as the son of Galindo, the count Velasco, in Pamplona, but this was opposed by the Basque party led by the Iñ́ıguez family), grandson of Galindo Aznárez and son of Aznar Gaĺındez. Aznar I governed under Frankish influence. Some sources mention him as count of Jaca. It is suposed that in 820 the allaince with the Franks was reversed, in favour of an alliance to Pamplona and the Banu Qasi of the Ebro Valley, and that he thus lost the county of Aragón and was compensated with Urgel and Cerdagne.<br />
 <br />
He married to Eneca Garcés (modern hypotheses believe a lady from Gascony) and they had four children: Matrona, married Garćıa Gaĺındez, king of Pamplona who deposed Aznar I and ruled Aragón 820-833; Eilo; Centulf; and Galindo I Aznárez, count of Aragón 844-867.<br />

Margaret de Clare<br />
From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia.<br />
 <br />
Margaret de Clare (1293-April 1342) was one of the three daughters of Gilbert de Clare, 3rd Earl of Gloucester and his wife, Joan of Acre. and thus a granddaughter of King Edward I of England.<br />
 <br />
She was married to Piers Gaveston, the favorite of her uncle Edward II, in October 1307. According to the Vita Edwardi Secundi, this marriage was arranged by the king "to strengthen Piers and surround him with friends." The marriage of such a high-born lady to a foreigner was not popular among the English nobility. They had one child:<br />
   1. Joan Gaveston, born probably January 12/18th, 1312, at York.<br />
 <br />
King Edward threw a grand celebration after the birth of this child, complete with minstrels. However, Piers Gaveston was executed only six months later, leaving Margaret a widow with a small child. Her dower rights as Countess of Cornwall were disputed, and so King Edward instead assigned her Okham castle and other lands. She joined the royal household and in 1316 accompanied the king in his journey from London to York.<br />
 <br />
Following the death of their brother, Gilbert de Clare, 8th Earl of Hertford, at the Battle of Bannockburn in 1314, Margaret and her sisters, Elizabeth and Eleanor de Clare each received a share of the inheritance. Margaret was now one of the co-heiresses to the vast Gloucester estate, and King Edward arranged a second marriage for her to another favorite, Hugh Audley.<br />
 <br />
On April 28, 1317 Margaret de Clare wed Hugh Audley at Windsor Castle. They had one daughter:<br />
   1. Margaret Audley, born between January 1318 and November 1322.<br />
 <br />
Hugh and Margaret were among the victims of their brother-in-law, Hugh the younger Despenser. In his rashness and greed for the Clare lands, he robbed Margaret of much of her rightful inheritance. In 1321, Hugh joined the other Marcher barons in looting, burning, and causing general devastation to Despenser's lands.<br />
 <br />
Hugh was captured at the Battle of Boroughbridge in 1322, and was saved from a hanging thanks to the pleas of his wife. He was imprisoned, and two months later Margaret was sent to Sempringham priory. She remained there until 1326, when Hugh escaped prison and she was released from Sempringham. In the meantime, her daughter Joan Gaveston had been sent to Amesbury priory. A marriage was arranged for Joan with the son of Thomas Multon, but the girl died in early 1325.<br />
 <br />

Her parents filed a complaint, but King Edward III of England supported Stafford. He appeased Hugh and Margaret by creating Hugh earl of Gloucester.<br />

Eorcenberht (died 14 July 664) was king of the Anglo-Saxon kingdom ofKent from 640 to 664, succeeding his father Eadbald.<br />
 <br />
The Mildrith legend suggests that he was the younger son of Eadbald, and that his older brother Eormenred was deliberately passed over, although another possibility is that they ruled jointly.<br />
 <br />
According to Bede (HE III.8), Eorcenberht was the first king in Britain to command that pagan idols be destroyed and that Lent be observed. After the death of Honorius, the Archbishop of Canterbury, Eorcenberht appointed the first Saxon archbishop, Deusdedit, in 655.<br />
 <br />
Eorcenberht married Seaxburh, daughter of king Anna of East Anglia, and their daughter Eorcengota became a nun at the abbey of Faremoutiers-en-Brie on the continent.<br />
 <br />
Eorcenberht was succeeded by his son Ecgberht.<br />

Wihtred (died April 23, 725) was a King of Kent (690 - 725). He was a sonof Ecgberht and a brother of Eadric.<br />
 <br />
He became king during the period of disorder in Kent that followed the invasion of Caedwalla of Wessex. Oswine, a king who had been supported by Mercia, lost power in 690, but the East Saxon Swafred (son of Sebbi, the king of Essex), who had been a king in Kent for a year or two, remained. Wihtred emerged and became king late in 690, apparently ruling alongside Swefred. Swefred maintained his position until at least 692, but by 694 Wihtred was the sole ruler of Kent.<br />
 <br />
It was also in 694 that Wihtred made peace with the West Saxon king Ine, which he achieved by paying compensation for the killing of Caedwalla's brother, Mul, in 687. Wihtred produced a law code for Kent, which was notable for its generosity toward the Church, which was granted freedom from taxation.<br />
 <br />
On his death, he left Kent to three different sons: Aethelbert, Eadbert, and Alric.<br />

Ecgberht, or Egbert (d. July 4, 673) was a King of Kent who ruled from664 to 673, succeeding his father Eorcenberht.<br />
 <br />
He may have still been a child when he became king following his father's death on July 14, 664, because his mother Seaxburh was recorded as having been regent.<br />
 <br />
Ecgberht's court seems to have had many diplomatic and ecclesiastic contacts. He hosted Wilfrid and Benedict Biscop, and provided escorts to Theodore and Hadrian for their travels in Gaul.<br />
 <br />
The Mildrith legend reports that he had his cousins Aethelred and Aethelberht (sons of his uncle Eormenred) killed; this may reflect a dynastic struggle that ended in the success of Eorcenberht's line.<br />
 <br />
A charter records his patronage of the monastery at Chertsey.<br />
 <br />
Ecgberht was succeeded by his brother Hlothhere, who was in turn succeeded by Ecgberht's son Eadric and still later by his other son Wihtred.<br />

Anna (d. 653/654) was a King of East Anglia (c. 635 - 653/654). He wasthe son of Eni and the nephew of Eni's brother, Raedwald of East Anglia.<br />
 <br />
Penda, king of the Mercians, invaded East Anglia around the year 635, defeating and killing king Egric and the former king Sigebert. Anna then became king. A convert to Christianity, Anna was noted for his piety, and he persuaded Cenwealh of Wessex to accept baptism while the latter was in exile in East Anglia (645 - 648), having been driven out of his own kingdom by another of Penda's invasions.<br />
 <br />
Penda returned to East Anglia around the year 650 and defeated Anna, forcing him into exile; he also established Mercian rule over the Middle Angles, making his son Peada their king. Anna briefly returned to power in the years that followed, but was again defeated and killed by Penda in a final invasion.<br />
 <br />
Five of Anna's daughters each became known for their saintly virtues; one of them, Æthelthryth, is said to have maintained her virginity through two marriages (her second husband was Ecgfrith of Northumbria) and later became the abbess of Ely.<br />

Eadbald (died January 20, 640) was the King of Kent from 616 until hisdeath.<br />
 <br />
He succeeded his father Æthelbert as king. At first, Eadbald renounced his baptism, rejected Christianity, and married his father's widow. He was later converted by Laurence of Canterbury, recalled Mellitus and Justus, and built a church at Canterbury. (However, the historian D. P. Kirby argued that Bede's account is confused, and that Eadbald was more likely to have been converted by Justus.)<br />
 <br />
He also arranged a marriage between his sister Æthelberg and Edwin of Northumbria, later taking her and Paulinus back when Edwin died in 633.<br />
 <br />
Eadbald married the Frankish princess Emma, daughter of Theudebert II of Austrasia, possibly in 624, and they had a son called Eorcenberht, who succeeded Eadbald as king.<br />

William Richard Bremer<br />
William Richard Bremer Bill took the high ground (like a true Marine) when he passed away on December 5, 2005 of cancer at Marin General Hospital. Bill, a fourth generation San Franciscan, was born January 5, 1930. He was the only son of Milton and Alice Bremer (dec.). He was a devoted husband to Margaret Herrington for 46 years, and he loved his family, Mark Richard (dec.), Karen Stevenson, William Richard, Jr., son-in-law Todd Stevenson, and grandson, Garrett Stevenson. He graduated from Menlo College before going into the Marine Corps. After serving in Korea he returned to study law and received a degree at USF Law School. He was a member of the Trial Lawyers of America, SF Trial Lawyers Association, SF Bar Association, SF Lawyers Club, Marin County Bar Association, and American Arbitration Association. He was admitted to the Supreme Court of the United States in 1965. Bill, an Attorney at law, had a private professional practice in San Francisco. He practiced all over the Bay Area with emphasis on litigation, civil and criminal law. His association with the law lasted over 45 years before he retired. When he first started his practice some clients could not pay their fees, so he would say I'll get it next time. He started getting cakes and chickens weekly like a country lawyer until he told these clients they had paid him in full. He was always ready to help people in trouble, and his advice was free. He always said that joining the Marines was the most important decision he made in his life (besides marrying Peggy). He remained active in the Reserve and served as Commanding Officer of a VTU (law) unit (JAG), at Treasure Island. He retired after 30 total years of service as a Colonel. He holds the Meritorious Service Medal and Combat Action Ribbon. Among their many travels, a great moment was when Bill and Peggy went to Korea on a Revisit Trip to view all the changes since that War. Bill's commitment to serve people did not stop with just being an attorney. As a resident of Tiburon since 1960, he was elected to the City of Tiburon as Councilman in 1966 (now Town of Tiburon). He served as the third Mayor in 1968. He took great satisfaction being able to set goals for a, then, young and growing town. Bill took pleasure owning a powerboat and joined the Corinthian Yacht Club, in Tiburon, becoming Commodore in 1986-87, during its 100-Year Celebration. He had also been a member of the Driftwood Yacht Club in the Delta, and the Richardson Bay Yacht Club. He loved motorcycling with his wife and joined the Montgomery Street Motorcycle Club becoming its President in 1974-75. The neighbors were always shocked by the 30 or more motorcycles in the driveway when Bill would throw a party. Bill and his wife Peggy toured all over the West on his motorcycle with friends and Club members. Being a Life Member of the Marines' Memorial Club of San Francisco was a great joy as he connected with Bay Area Marines. He served on the Board of Directors and became President in 1985-86. The Marine Birthday Ball in November was always a special event he enjoyed because he felt the patriotic warm feeling of being around other Marines. Once a Marine, always a Marine. Continuing with his "can do" attitude, he was a Life member of the San Francisco Council of the Navy League, serving as past President, and Northern California State President. He was named as National Director Emeritus in 2000. Bill became a Life Member of the Naval Order of the United States, serving as the Commandery Commander. He went on to serve as the Commander General (National President) of the Order in 1993-95 traveling all over the United States and was honored to have dedicated the "Great White Fleet Bronze" at The Lone Sailor United States Navy Memorial in Washington, DC on behalf of the Naval Order of the United States. With Bill's association with the Navy, as well as, the Marine's he became Regional Vice President for the Northern California Naval War College in 1997-2000 going to Newport, Rhode Island yearly. He was also on the Board of Directors of Kiwanis in San Francisco 1981-83, and Board of Directors of the Bay Area USO, 1980-89. Also on the Board of Directors of Marshal Hale Memorial Hospital, 1986-88, Children's Hospital, San Francisco, 1988-91 and Bridgeway Plan for Health, 1988-92. After closing his San Francisco Office and practicing at home, Bill then joined the Tiburon-Belvedere Rotary. He served on the Board of Directors and became President, 2001-2002. Bill was an avid piano player and was always a party highlight when he would ask, "if you can sing it, I can play It.". He was energetic, ready with a joke, and had a sharp wit, a wonderful smile, and loved his straight up dry gin martini with no olive. There will be a private service for the family to say good bye. Bill wanted his friends to have a drink in their hands when they remembered him. A party honoring his life will be held at the Marines' Memorial Club in San Francisco on January 30th, 2006 at 4:00 p.m. "Semper Fi" Bill In lieu of flowers, contributions may be made to your favorite charity or in memory of Colonel William R.

Saer de Quincy, 1st Earl of Winchester (d. November 3, 1219) was one ofthe leaders of the baronial rebellion against king John of England.<br />
 <br />
His name is variously spelled. The first name is sometimes rendered Saher or Seer, and the last name Quency or Quenci.<br />
 <br />
His background is a little uncertain. He was probably the son of Robert FitzRichard and nephew of another Saer de Quincy, who was lord of Buckby in Northamptonshire.<br />
 <br />
Sometime between 1168 and 1173 de Quincy married Margaret, youngest daughter of Robert de Beaumont, 3rd Earl of Leicester.<br />
 <br />
Quincy was one of the barons who took part in the rebellion of Henry the Young King in 1184. Like most of the rebels, he eventually received his lands back after the rebellion failed. He subsequently served as castellan at various castles in the English royal possessions in France. Most notably, in 1203 he was castellan at Vandreuil in Normandy, and surrendered it to the French.<br />
 <br />
In 1204 de Quincy's brother-in-law Robert de Beaumont, 4th Earl of Leicester died, leaving de Quincy's wife as co-heiress along with her elder sister. The estate was split in half, and after the final division was ratified in 1207 de Quincy was made earl of Winchester.<br />
 <br />
Quincy never got along with king John, and was one of the 25 guarenteors of the Magna Carta. He fought against John in the troubles that followed the signing of the Charter, and against Henry III as well.<br />
 <br />
After the failure of the early attempts to depose Henry III, de Quincy decided to fulfill a vow he had made to go on crusade. In 1219 he left to join the Fifth Crusade, then besieging Damietta. There he fell sick and died.<br />
 <br />
By his wife Margaret de Beaumont he had three sons and a daughter:<br />
 <br />
    * Robert (d. 1217). Some sources say he married Hawise, sister and co-heiress of Ranulf de Blundeville, earl of Chester. However, it is more likely Hawise married Saer's brother Robert;<br />
    * Roger, who succeeded his father as earl of Winchester (though he did not take formal possession of the earldom until after his mother's death);<br />
    * another Robert (d. 1257) who married Helen, daughter of the Welsh prince Llywelyn the Great;<br />
    * Hawise, who married Hugh de Vere, 4th Earl of Oxford.<br />

 <br />
William Montacute, 1st Earl of Salisbury, 3rd Baron Montacute (1301-1344) was an English nobleman.<br />
 <br />
He was the eldest son of William Montacute, 2nd Baron Montacute, and succeeded his father as baron in 1319.<br />
 <br />
Montacute accompanied Edward III in repelling the Scottish invasion of 1327. The next year he served the king on diplomatic missions to the king of France and to the Pope.<br />
 <br />
In 1330, at the behest of the king, Montacute and some of his men arrested Roger Mortimer, and after Mortimer's execution Montacute received a good part of the forfeited estates.<br />
 <br />
Montacute took part in the Scottish campaigns of the following years, notably at the Battle of Halidon Hill in 1333.<br />
 <br />
Also in 1333 the king gave Montacute the English claim to the Isle of Man.<br />
 <br />
He was created earl of Salisbury on March 16, 1337.<br />
 <br />
In 1338 the new earl went an a lengthy diplomatic mission, first to France to declare king Edward claims to the French crown, and then to visit many of the German princes who might ally against France. Later that year he was made Marshall of England.<br />
 <br />
During the next two years he was one of the commanders of the English forces in Flanders, until he was captured by the French near Lille. He was released later in 1340 as part of a prisoner exchange, on the condition that he never again fight against the French.<br />
 <br />
It was probably sometime after his return to England that he conquered the Isle of Man, which had been held by the Scots.<br />
 <br />
He married Catherine Grandison, daughter of William Grandison, 1st Baron Grandison. Legend holds that Edward III was in love with her, and that it was her dropped garter from which the Order of the Garter derives its name. The matter is disputed, but the garter at least is more likely to have belonged to Joan of Kent, who was engaged to her son. There is also a story that the king raped the countess, but this is probably a fruit of French propaganda.<br />
 <br />
Montacute was succeeded by his eldest son, William Montacute, 2nd Earl of Salisbury. One of his daughters, Philippa, married Roger Mortimer, 2nd Earl of March.<br />

 <br />
Alexius I (1048-August 15, 1118), Byzantine emperor (1081-1118), was the third son of John Comnenus, the nephew of Isaac I Comnenus (emperor 1057-1059).<br />
 <br />
His father declined the throne on the abdication of Isaac, who was accordingly succeeded by four emperors of other families between 1059 and 1081. Under one of these emperors, Romanus IV Diogenes (1067-1071), he served with distinction against the Seljuk Turks. Under Michael VII Parapinaces (1071-1078) and Nicephorus III Botaniates (1078-1081) he was also employed, along with his elder brother Isaac, against rebels in Asia Minor, Thrace and in Epirus in 1071.<br />
 <br />
The success of the Comneni roused the jealousy of Botaniates and his ministers, and the Comneni were almost compelled to take up arms in self-defence. Botaniates was forced to abdicate and retire to a monastery, and Isaac declined the crown in favour of his younger brother Alexius, who then became emperor at the age of 33.<br />
 <br />
By that time Alexius was the lover of the Empress Maria of Alania, an Alan princess from the Caucasus who was successively married to Michael VII Ducas and his successor Botaniates, and was renowned for her beauty. Alexius and Maria lived almost openly together at the Palace of Mangana, and Alexius had Michael VII and Maria's young son, the prince Constantine Ducas, adopted and proclaimed heir to the throne. The affair conferred to Alexius a degree of dynastic legitimacy, but soon his mother Anna Dalassena consolidated the Ducas family connection by arranging the Emperor's wedding with Irene Ducaena or Doukaina, granddaughter of the caesar John Ducas, head of a powerful feudal family and the "kingmaker" behind Michael VII.<br />
 <br />
Alexius' involvement with Maria continued and shortly after his daughter Anna Comnena was born, she was betrothed to Constantine Ducas and moved to live at the Mangana Palace with him and Maria. The situation however changed drastically when John II Comnenus was born: Anna's engagement to Constantine was dissolved, she was moved to the main Palace to live with her mother and grandmother, Constantine's status as heir was terminated and Alexius became estranged with Maria, now stripped of her imperial title. Shortly afterwards, the teenager Constantine died and Maria was confined to a convent.<br />
 <br />
Alexius' long reign of nearly 37 years was full of struggle. At the very outset he had to meet the formidable attack of the Normans (Robert Guiscard and his son Bohemund), who took Dyrrhachium and Corfu, and laid siege to Larissa in Thessaly (see Battle of Dyrrhachium). The Norman danger ended for the time with Robert Guiscard's death in 1085, and the conquests were reversed.<br />
 <br />
He had next to repel the invasions of Pechenegs and Cumans in Thrace, with whom the Manichaean sect of the Bogomils made common cause; and thirdly, he had to cope with the fast-growing power of the Seljuk Turks in Asia Minor.<br />
 <br />
Above all he had to meet the difficulties caused by the arrival of the knights of the First Crusade, which had been, to a great degree, initiated as the result of the representations of his own ambassadors, whom he had sent to Pope Urban II at the Council of Piacenza in 1095. The help which he wanted from the West was simply mercenary forces and not the immense hosts which arrived, to his consternation and embarrassment. The first group, under Peter the Hermit, he dealt with by sending them on to Asia Minor, where they were massacred by the Turks in 1096.<br />
 <br />
The second and much more serious host of knights, led by Godfrey of Bouillon, he also led into Asia, promising to supply them with provisions in return for an oath of homage, and by their victories recovered for the Byzantine Empire a number of important cities and islands-Nicaea, Chios, Rhodes, Smyrna, Ephesus, Philadelphia, Sardis, and in fact most of Asia Minor (1097-1099). This is ascribed by his daughter Anna as a credit to his policy and diplomacy, but by the Latin historians of the crusade as a sign of his treachery and falseness. The crusaders believed their oaths were made invalid when Alexius did not help them during the siege of Antioch; Bohemund, who had set himself up as Prince of Antioch, briefly went to war with Alexius, but agreed to become Alexius' vassal under the Treaty of Devol in 1108.<br />
 <br />
During the last twenty years of his life he lost much of his popularity. The years were marked by persecution of the followers of the Paulician and Bogomil heresies-one of his last acts was to burn Basilius, a Bogomil leader, with whom he had engaged in a theological controversy; by renewed struggles with the Turks (1110-1117); and by anxieties as to the succession, which his wife Irene wished to alter in favour of her daughter Anna's husband, Nicephorus Bryennius, for whose benefit the special title panhypersebastos ("honored above all") was created. This intrigue disturbed even his dying hours.<br />
 <br />
Alexius was for many years under the strong influence of an eminence grise, his mother Anna Dalassena, a wise and immensely able politician whom, in a uniquely irregular fashion, he had crowned as Empress Augusta instead of the rightful claimant to the title, his wife Irene. Dalassena was the effective administrator of the Empire during Alexius' long absences in war campaigns: she was constantly at odds with her daughter-in-law and had assumed total responsibility for the upbringing and education of her granddaughter Anna Comnena.<br />

Lauren Canario is a libertarian activist member of the Free State Projectresiding in Winchester, New Hampshire.<br />
Canario attracted media attention after she was arrested in Connecticut following a peaceful protest in which she refused to budge from a Connecticut citizen's residential property. The land had been forcibly confiscated by the local city government, New London, to be handed over to Pfizer for development. New London's controversial use of eminent domain to seize private individuals' homes and land to hand the property over to an unrelated private business was one of the first such incidents in American history to gain major notice by the press and the public, and the issue culminated in the Supreme Court case Kelo v. New London.[1]<br />
More recently, Canario has shown support[2] for Edward and Elaine Brown, who were convicted of Federal income tax offenses. On September 15, 2007, Lauren Canario was arrested for trying to visit the Browns, who were engaged in an armed standoff with Federal law enforcement officials. She was released without charges that night.[citation needed]<br />
On October 2, 2007, Canario was the subject of a traffic stop in Milford, New Hampshire. She was subsequently arrested for speeding, driving without a license, driving an unregistered vehicle, refusing to obey lawful orders of a police officer, and resisting arrest. Canario has refused to speak or communicate in any way with police, court officials, or jail guards, as she does not recognize the authority of the government. Therefore, she has made no attempt to make bail or retain an attorney, or participate in the jail system enough to make out an approved visitors list. Canario was released on November 7, 2007, after being convicted and sentenced to time served.<br />

A New Yorker Eloping with an Indiana Lady - A Scamp<br />
From the Cincinnati Gazette<br />
A Short time ago, Sandford S. Partridge, a young man belonging to a respectable and wealthy family at Seneca Falls, N. Y., ran off from Aurora, Indiana, with a young lady, a member of one of the principal families of that place.  He cam to this city and hired a buggy and two horses at Wm. Woodsʼ livery stable, with which he went off with the young lady.  A week or ten days ago, Partridge was apprehended and held to bail, by the Police Judge of this city, in $1,000 for his appearance to answer for the theft of the two horses and buggy.  Not being able to gain the required security, he was put in prison.  Immediately on his committal officer Rose started on a tour of discovery after the buggy and horses.  This journey was tedious and tortuous, but he succeeded in recovering the whole of the property.  At Palestine, Ia., a hundred miles north of Indianapolis, he found a horse, a set of harness, and the pole of the buggy. At Bloomington, Ill., he discovered the buggy and the second set of harness.  In Pekin, Ill., he found the remaining horse, and was thus able to restore to Mr. Woods all he had lost, as well as furnish complete evidence as to the criminal conduct of Partridge.<br />
Besides seduction and larceny, a yet heavier charge lies against Partridge.  A letter has been received by or Police from C. Tucker, Esq., of Buffalo, stating that Partridge aided by an accomplice, who is in prison, had obtained $1,000 from the New York and Erie Bank of Buffalo, the authorities of which place are anxious to have him in their power.<br />

In 1306, the titular King of Scotland was John Baliol, a 'lamb amongwolves' who had achieved the throne through the backing of Edward ofEngland and John Comyn of Badenoch, head of the most powerful family inScotland at that time. Baliol had fled to France with no intention ofreturning, leaving Scotland virtually kingless. Robert the Bruce hadseemingly started planning his rising in 1304, but everything hinged uponthe support of John Comyn, a difficult person: the Red comyn must eithersupport Bruce or be dead. The climax came in 1306, when Bruce met theComyn in Greyfriars church in Dumfries. As they stoodbefore the alter andargued, knives were drawn, and John Comyn fell wounded. According tolegend, Bruce ran out of the church crying 'I doubt I have slain the RedComyn'. Kilpatrick answered his "Do you so doubt? Then I'll mak siccar',and rushed into the church followed by Sir Robert Boyd and finished thejob. Legendary as this may be, the fact is that both John Comyn ofBadenoch and Sir Robert Comyn were both killed.<br />

This family originated from Bohun in the arrondissement of St-Lo in theCotentin, Normandy, where there still exists St-Andre and St-Georges deBohon. The mound of the old castle is still visible. He was a companionof the Conqueror at Senlac, who at that time held the fief. He is reputedto have been a near kinsman of Duke William, but how or to what degree isnot clear. The fact remains that the witnesses to the Benedictine prioryat St-George's in 1092, were all members of King William's immediatefamily or branches thereof. He was married 3X, names unknown, and d.prior to 1113, leaving three sons, Robert, Richard de Meri, sire deBohun, and Humphrey II. [Falaise Roll, p. 57]<br />
The Bohuns of Midhurst who actually held Bohon in the 12th century descended in the male line from Savaric son of Cana and the vicomtes of Beaumont in Maine. The earls of Hereford who descended in the paternal line from Bohun were a younger branch. [Anglo-Norman Families, p. 16]<br />
A modest Norman nobleman. Gained his fortune at an early age by accompanying William the Conqueror on his grand adventure. Founded the Bohon Priory in Normandy and gave birth to two branches of the family.<br />
Godfather of William the Conqueror.<br />
The oldest mention of Humphrey is in William's journals. It confirms a donation made at the abbey of St. Trinite du Mont at Rouen by Gilbert, Osbern's vassal. William's signature is accompanied by that of Humphrey, son of Richard, listed with the rest of William's men.<br />
A document signed by Sir William, duke of the Normands, before 1066 shows that Humphrey de Bohon gave a garden from his fief in Puchay to the nuns of St. Amand in Rouen for the repose of his soul and those of his three wives when one of his daughters became religious.<br />
The monastery of St. Leger in Preaux was given the deeds to Barbeville, St. Marie's Church, the town of Carentan, and the neighboring rectory. Later Humphrey bequeathed the monastery a convent that his second daughter entered. Humphrey's sons Robert and Richard agreed with his actions. On the Bayeux tapestry, in a meal scene presided over by Bishop Odo, a bearded man is sitting to William's right. It is possible that this is Humphrey de Bohon with the Beard, who would occupy a place of honor at the table out of respect for his age.<br />
In 1076, on King William's orders, in the Act of Cherbourg he renders justice with the monks at the Heauville Priorty against Bertram de Bricquebec, viscount of Cotentin who had levied unfair taxes on his people. Humphrey is mentioned in the Domesday Book as a champion and defender of the throne, and as lord of Taterford in Norfolk. Much of his wealth is attributed to the goodwill of William and the spoils of the campaigns, which was not a unique situation. However, the possession of large estates and properties in England was not all fun; they were hard to protect from raiders and warring lords. Humphyre probably also benefited from Normandy's continued growth and profits from his holdings.<br />

 <br />
Árpád (c.850-907) was the probable leader of the main proto-Magyar tribe, and the founder of the Arpad dynasty. Árpád was the son of Álmos.<br />
 <br />
According to (not very reliable) medieval chronicles, seven proto-Magyar tribes elected him - as the leader of one of those tribes - their common leader in Etelköz around 890. He is said to have been the leader ("prince" - fejedelem) of the proto-Magyars for 20 years and to have died in 907. The Byzantine De administrando imperio says around 950: Prior to this Árpád, the Magyars did never have another ruling prince ('archont') and since then up to today the ruling prince of Hungary has been from that family. Other sources however imply that there was a second ruling prince called Kursan, who was either at the same "level" with Árpád, or a kind of "vice-prince". Based on Arabic sources, Árpád's title seems to have been kende, although some scholars consider Kende to be the name of a person.<br />
 <br />
After several looting raids in Europe (from the 860s onwards), the proto-Magyars in Etelköz under Árpád, pushed by the Pechenegs from the East, decided to definitively pass the Carpathian Mountains. In 896 they occupied the Upper Tisza river, from there they undertook numerous looting raids in central and western Europe, and in 900/901 they moved to Pannonia. The proto-Magyars entering the Pannonian fields in 896 represented about 200,000 - 250,000 people.<br />
 <br />
According to De administrando imperio, his children included (maybe not exclusively) :<br />
   1. Tarhos (Tarkacsu)<br />
   2. Üllo" (Jeleg)<br />
   3. Jutas (Jutocsa)<br />
   4. Zolta (Zaltasz) - the youngest one.<br />
 <br />
According to legends, Árpád is also said to have been holding the first "parliamentary" session with 40 other "nobles" on horseback before 900 AD.<br />

Eustace FitzJohn (d 1157), judge and constable of Chester, was the son ofJohn de Burgh, and the nephew and heir of Serlo de Burgh, lord ofKnaresborough, and the founder of its castle. Like his brother, PainFitzjohn, he became attached to the court of Henry I. He witnessed somecharters of 1183. In the only extant Pipe Roll of Henry's reign heappears as acting as justice itinerant, in the north in conjunction withWalter Espec. He won Henry's special favour, received grants that mde himvery powerful in Yorkshire, and was reputed to be a man of great wisdom.Dugdale gives from manuscript sources a list of Henry's donations toEustace. He was also governor of Bamburgh Castle. He witnessed thecharter of Archbishop Thurstan to Beverley. On the death of Henry,Fitzjohn remained faithful to the cause of Matilda, and was inconsequence taken into custody and deprived of his governorship ofBamburgh. He joined David, kin of Scots, when that king invaded the northin 1138. He surrendered Alnwick Castle to David, and held out againstStephen in his own castle of Malton. He was present at the Battle of theStandard, where he and his followers fought alongside the men of'Cumberland' and Tevictdale in the second line of King David's host. Inthe latter part of Stephen's reign he lived quietly in the north underthe government of the Scottish king, by whose grants his possessions wereconfirmed.<br />
 <br />
Fitzjohn was a lavish patron of the chruch and the special friend of new orders of regulars. In 1131 he witnessed the charter by which his colleague, Walter Espec, founded Rievaulx, the first Cistercian house established in Yorshire. When the first monks of Fountains were in the direst distress and had given away their last loaves in charity, Eustace's timely present of a load of bread from Knaresborough was looked on as little less than a miracle. He also made two gifts of lands to Fountains. In 1147 he founded the abbey of Alnwick for Premonstratensian canons. This was the first house of that order in England, and was erected only two years after the order was founded. Fitzjohn was a friend of St Gilbert of SEmpringham, and established two of the earliest houses for the mixed convents of canons and nuns called, after their founder, the Gilbertines. Between 1147 and 1154 Fitzjohn, in conjunction with his second wife, Agnes, founded a Gilbertine house at Watton in Yorkshire, and another at Old Malton in the same country. A few years later his grants to Malton were confirmed. He also made grants to the monks of St Peter's Gloucester, the chruch of Flamborough, and to the Austin canons of Bridlington.<br />
 <br />
Fitzjohn made two rich marriages. His first wife was Deatrice, daughter and heiress of Ivo de Vesci. She brough him Alnwick and Malton. She died at the birth of his son by her, William, who adopted the name of Vescy, and was active in the public service during the reign of Henry II, and was sheriff of Northumberland between the fourth and sixteenth years of Henry II. He was the ancestor of the Barons de Vescy. His son Eustace was prominent among the northern barons, whose revolt from John led to the signing of the Magna Charta. Fitzjohn's second wife was Agnes, daughter of William, Baron of Halton and constable of Chester, one of the leading lords of that palatinate. He obtained from Earl Ranulph II of Chester a grant of his father-in-law's estates and titles. He was recogised in the grant as leading counsellor to the earl, 'above all the nobles of that country.' In his new capacity he took part in Henry II's first disastrous expedition into Wales, and was slain (July 1157) in the unequal fight when the king's army fell into an ambush at Basingwerk. He was then an old man. By his second wife he left a son, Richard Fitzeustace, the ancestor of the Claverings and the Lacies. [Dictionary of National Biography VI:183-4]<br />
 <br />

 <br />
 <br />
EUSTACE FITZJOHN, brother and heir male, was born before 1100. He became possessed of his father's manor of Saxlingham and made a further gift of 20s. therefrom to Gloucester Abbey. Like his brothers he became a trusted officer of Henry I. He first appears as a witness to a royal charter before 1120 (1116-19), after which he constantly attests Henry I's charters, &c. In 1130 he and William de Luvetot were keepers of Tickhill Castle and the Honor of Blyth, and Eustace farmed Aldborough and Knaresborough. He was acting then as a Justice itinerant in the north, usually with Walter Espec. He is said to have become an intimate friend of Henry I, who granted him large estates and made him Constable of Bamburgh Castle. In consequence of his 1st marriage, he held Alnwick Castle in Northumberland and Malton Castle in Yorkshire. He was at Stephen's Easter court at Westminster in 1136 and later was with him at Clarendon. When Stephen advanced against the King of Scots early in 1138 and pursued him across the border, Eustace was in his army; but the King, hearing that some of his barons were traitors, arrested Eustace, and deprived him of the command of the castles which Henry had entrusted to him. Angered by this treatment Eustace, when the King of Scots invaded England later in the year, joined him and marched with him into Yorkshire, where he put David in possession of Malton Castle. At the Battle of the Standard, 22 August 1138, he fought in David's army, in Prince Henry's division beside the men of Cumberland and Teviotdale, but he was wounded and escaped with difficulty to his castle.<br />
 <br />
In or before 1139 he became Constable of Chester in right of his 2nd wife. In 1139, when peace had been concluded between England and Scotland and Stephen had given Northumberland to Prince Henry, the Prince confirmed to Eustace all the grants which he had received from Henry I and made him further grants of lands. Eustace was evidently reconciled to Stephen, as he was with the King at Stamford before Easter 1142. During the remainder of the reign he seems to have remained quiescent, living as a great baron of the north, where he even coined his own silver pennies. On 30 November 1143 he was one of those who arranged a truce between the rival bishops of Durham. He is also found attesting, as Constable of Chester, charters of the Earls of Chester. In February 1154/5 he was probably with Henry II at York; about June 1157 he was with him at Waltham; and in the following month he took part in the King's expedition into North Wales. He founded Alnwick Abbey for Premonstratensian canons, and between 1147 and 1154 he founded Gilbertian Convents at Watton and Malton. He was a benefactor to the Abbeys of Gloucester, Fountains, and Bridlington.<br />
 <br />
He married, 1stly, Beatrice, only daughter and heir of Yves DE VESCY, lord of Alnwick and Malton, by [it is said] "Alda" only daughter and heir of William Tyson, also lord of Alnwick and Malton. She died in childbirth. He married, 2ndly, Agnes, elder sister and coheir of William and daughter of William FITZNEEL, both Barons of Halton in the palatinate of Chester and Constables of Chester. Eustace died in July 1157, being slain when part of Henry II's army was ambushed in the pass of Consyllt, near Basingwerk, in North Wales. His widow married Robert FITZCOUNT, apparently an illegitimate son of an Earl of Chester. He became Constable of Chester jure uxoris and died in or before 1166. [Complete Peerage XII/2:272-4, (transcribed by Dave Utzinger)]<br />
 <br />

 <br />
James Tait ("Knight-Service in Cheshire" [English Historical Review 57], 450)<br />
says that after William, son of William FitzNigel died without issue, Earl Ranulph granted the constableship to Eustace FitzJohn, husband of Agnes, eldest sister and coheiress of William II. The actmacl charter by which Earl Ranulph granted the honor is printed in _A Medieval Miscellany for Doris Mary Stenton_[Pipe Roll Society, 1962] uder the authorship of Geoffrey Barraclough ("Some charters of the Earls of Chester"), 28-9. Barraclough states that Eustace fitz John's first wife, the heiress of Ivo de Vesci, died in childbirth, and that he then married Agnes, sister of William, constable of Chester, who succeeded his father [the Domesday baron] in the barony of Halton about 1130. After William [II] died childess, his inheritance was divided between his two sisters, Agnes, and Matilda, wife of Albert Grelley, lord of Manchester.<br />
 <br />
At one point, when Earl Ranulf was 'at loggerheads' with King David of Scotland, Eustace had sided with Scotland (remember, this was during the reign and struggle of King Stephan). After the battle of Lincoln (2 Feb. 1141), Ranulf was forced into league with the Empress Matilda against Stephan, and the Earl and Eustace were again on the same side. The date of the charter by which Eustace fitz John succeeded to the constableship is estimated to be about 1144-5. He would not have granted it to an enemy,and the grant specifically states it was hereditary ("Eustachius et heredes sui"). Eustace was also a Justice itinerant, commanded Scottish troops against Stephen at the battle of Standard in 1138, and founded the Abbeys of Alnwick, Old Malton and Watton. He was slain in Wales in 1157.<br />

 <br />
Eustace Fitz-John (nephew and heir of Serlo de Burgh, founder of Knaresborough Castle), one of the most powerful of the northern barons and a great favourite with King Henry I. With his two brothers, he was a witness to the foundation of the abbey of Cirencester, co. Gloucester, 1133. He m. 1st, Agnes, eldest dau. of William Fitz Nigel, Baron of Halton, constable of Chester. By this lady he acquired the Barony of Halton, and had an only son, Richard Fitz-Eustace. Eustace Fitz-John m. 2ndly, Beatrice, only dau. and heiress of Yvo de Vesci, Lord of Alnwick, in Northumberland, and of Malton, in Yorkshire, by whom he had issue, William, progenitor of the great baronial house of de Vesci.

 <br />
Eustace Fitz-John, nephew and heir of Serlo de Burgh (of the great family of Burgh), the founder of Knaresborough Castle, in Yorkshire, and son of John, called Monoculus, from having but one eye, is said by an historian of the period in which he lived, to have been "one of the chiefest peers of England," and of intimate familiarity with King Henry I, as also a person of great wisdom and singular judgment in councils. He had immense grants from the crown and was constituted governor of the castle of Bamburg, in Northumberland, temp. Henry I, of which governorship, however, he was deprived by King Stephen, but he subsequently enjoyed the favour of that monarch. He fell the ensuing reign, anno, 1157, in an engagement with the Welsh, "a great and aged man, and of the chiefest English peers, most eminent for his wealth and wisdom." By his first wife, the heiress of Vesci, he had two sons, and by Agnes, his 2nd wife, dau. of William FitzNigel, Baron of Halton, and constable of Chester, he left another son, called Richard Fitz-Eustace.

High Prince (fejedelem) Álmos was the legendary father of Árpád, the founder of the Hungarian state. He was probably born around 820, and was leader of the Hungarian tribes from 858 till his death in 895 or 896. His mother was Emese; his father was Ogyek, both of Dentumogeria, Central Asia.<br />
 <br />
The legends say that "his mother Emese had seen a divine dream of a Turul bird that flew over her and got her with child; she saw her womb as the source of many great kings, but they would multiply in foreign lands". This is given as the explanation for the name Álmos (ie, "The Dreamt One"). Although this may seem unusual compared to Christian stories, it justified the divine origins of the Hungarian leaders.<br />
 <br />
He strengthened the alliance between the tribal leaders, and he probably led the movement to secede from the Khazar empire. He successfully kept his son Árpád in power, contrary to tribal practices. The raids were widespread, and the tribes successfully settled in Etelköz, where they were able to fight back the Besenyo" (Pecheneg) attacks, becoming stronger by them.<br />
 <br />
His death, according to the legends prophesied by a warning that "he is going to found a great line of emperors, but he must not enter the land of Pannonia", was probably caused by either assassination or human sacrifice. Unfortunately, we do not have enough information on tribal beliefs to explain the real significance of the prophetic legend.<br />
 <br />
Note that the two legends concerning Álmos' conception and death are reported to us by 13th century (already Christian) scholars in medieval codices, who lived 400 years after the actual life of Álmos, and that both legends show very strong parallels to Christian stories from the Bible. It is possible that, for Álmos' birth, the authors borrowed elements of Mary's conception by the Holy Spirit; and for his death, of Moses' not being allowed to enter Canaan after leading Israel to the Holy Land.<br />

DIARY OF LOIS ANN (HAWKES) CASE<br />
I was born in a small house on Knights Creek Road in Scio, NY. A neighbor lady named Dolly Clark named me. Mom said she liked to put names together that matched, so that is how I got my name. I am number 7 of 9 children. I have two sisters and one brother passed away. I started school when I was six years old (1939) in a one-room school on Horse Run Road in Shinglehouse, PA. That is where we were living when my oldest brother died by drowning. I was six years old. My grandfather Hawkes died the year before. The School is now a home. We lived there for about 3 years. My teacher was Elizabeth Lunn. From there we move to the Jones house in Kibbeville, Millport, PA. We lived in another house there also, as we traded houses with the school teacher. Mary Greenhill was her name. She was a very nice person. She caught me chewing gum in school one day in class and made me stay in at recess. Another time I came down off the slide and landed on my spine and had to go home for the rest of the day. I'm not sure how long we lived there, maybe a year or two.<br />

Stuart "Bud" Kirvan -- a former weekly newspaper editor, popularcolumnist, and public relations executive -- died July 1, 2010 inPetoskey. He was 90 and had suffered from Alzheimer's disease for thepast three years.<br />
A veteran of the U.S. Navy during World War II, Mr. Kirvan grew up in the small town of Mecosta, Mich. and attended Central Michigan University before he was called to service in North Africa. Upon his return to the States in 1945, he began his career in journalism, working in a series of writing and editing roles with weekly newspapers in St. Johns, Lapeer, and Livonia. It was during his years as an editor at The Lapeer County Press, which at the time was considered one of the finest weekly newspapers in the nation, that he began writing his "Once Over Lightly" column. The column soon became a popular weekly feature that he continued to write for more than 50 years, eventually appearing in papers over a five-state region in the Midwest.<br />
In the early 1960s, Mr. Kirvan was appointed head of public relations for WXYZ-TV in Detroit, a job that would launch his career in corporate communications for several major companies. He spent the bulk of his career as the director of communications and public relations for Dundee Cement Co., now known as Holcim and a subsidiary of a Swiss-owned company that is one of the largest cement manufacturers in the world. He later served as a public relations consultant to such clients as Owens-Corning, the Fiberglas manufacturer, and Mars Inc., maker of M & M's and Snickers. He also served as a political consultant to a host of state and federal candidates, and was one of the principal writers for the Michigan Constitutional Convention in 1961-62.<br />
He was born November 21, 1919 in Mecosta, the son of Wilda and Oscar Kirvan. On July 11, 1942, he was married to Annalee Partridge in her hometown of Gladwin, Mich. The couple raised four children, and spent most of their married life in Ann Arbor before retiring to Harbor Springs and then Petoskey. His beloved wife, who served as a registered nurse in Ann Arbor for many years, died in June 2009 at age 89, a month short of what would have been the couple's 67th wedding anniversary.<br />
Throughout his career and particularly during his retirement years, he was active in various community, church, and charitable causes, at one point spending six weeks in a famine-ravaged section of Africa as part of a mission for Project Mercy, an international relief organization dedicated to assisting refugees in strife-torn regions of the African continent.<br />
An avid golfer, he served as president of Lakelands Golf and Country Club and Birchwood Farms Golf and Country Club, and also formerly was a board member at Barton Hills Country Club in Ann Arbor. He recorded a hole-in-one on the 15th hole at Birchwood Farms, becoming the third member of his family to score an ace. He also was a lifelong fan of the Detroit Tigers, attending games in the 1935, 1945, and 1968 World Series. He similarly was a devoted follower of University of Michigan basketball and football as a season ticket holder for more than four decades.<br />
A gifted public speaker, he was well known for his special sense of humor, as well as his kindness and generosity. He was a loving and devoted family man who took special joy in an ever-growing circle of friends.<br />
Survivors include: four children, Susan and her husband Tom Stanley of Whitewater, Wis., Anya and her husband David Jones of Boulder, Colo., Nancy Peters of Petoskey, and Tom Kirvan of Saline; five grandsons, Howard Stanley and his wife Karrie of Chicago, Andrew Harris of Durango, Colo., Jesse Kirvan of Durango, Aaron Peters and his wife Mary of Mount Pleasant, and Keith Connaghan-Jones and his wife Kelsey of Denver; and one great-grandson, Ryan Stanley of Chicago.<br />
A memorial service is planned for Friday, July 9 at 2 p.m. in Stone Funeral Home, Petoskey. Cremation has taken place and his ashes will be spread at a memorial garden overlooking Little Traverse Bay in Petoskey.<br />
Memorial contributions may be made to Hospice of Little Traverse Bay in Petoskey, Mott Children's Hospital in Ann Arbor, New Life Anglican Church in Petoskey, or St. Andrew Episcopal Church in Ann Arbor.<br />
Arrangements are being handled by Stone Funeral Home in Petoskey.<br />

------------------------------------<br />
CONSPICUOUS among the founders of the town of Dedham, Massachusetts, was Samuel Morse, who came from England in 1635, and soon afterward Christopher Grant became one of the first settlers of Watertown, Massachusetts. Then- descendants lived in that colony and State, intermarrying with the families of Adams of Braintree, Cheever of Boston, Coolidge, Eustis, Mellidge, Rea, Watson, and others. In the seventh generation from the one was born Adolphus Morse, and in the same generation from the other was born Mary E. Grant. These two married, uniting not only the family names, but the distinctive hues of character that had marked the two families for centuries. In 1850 they removed from Massachusetts and established a new home at Rochester, New York, where was born to them, on March 13, 1859, a son.<br />
Such was the origin of Waldo Grant Morse. He was educated in the schools of Rochester, and in Rochester University, but was compelled to leave the latter institution before graduation on account of impaired health. Two years of rest and travel followed, and then he took up the study of law in the Rochester office of Martindale & Oliver. He was admitted to the bar in 1884, and began the practice of his profession in his native city, in a new office of his own, and without a partner. The venture was eminently successful. At the end of four years the young man's standing in the legal world of Rochester was well secured. Then his ambition led him to seek a place in a larger world.<br />
Seneca Falls, Sept. 17 - Word was received here yesterday of the death in a hospital at Kingston of Waldo G. Morse, 75, attorney of New York, and president and a director of the State Bank of Seneca Falls.<br />
Mr. Morse was stricken with a heart attack in Kingston while enroute by automobile from Seneca Falls to New York and taken to the hospital but failed to rally. Born in Rochester, Mr. Morse was educated In the schools of that city and graduated from the University of Rochester. He maintained law offices in New York for many years and had residences at 47 Cayuga street in Seneca Palls and in Yonkers. His wife, Mrs. Adelaide Cook Morse, a native of Seneca Palls, died in February, last year.<br />
Mr. Morse became president of the State Bank of Seneca Falls following the death of Thomas Pallard in 1932.  He was an attorney for the Grange League Federation and for the American Agriculturist. Several thousand acres of land in the Montezuma marshes northeast of here were owned by Mr. Morse.<br />

---------------------------------------------<br />
Mr. Morse accordingly came to New York and entered upon the practice of the law here. At the beginning of his metropolitan career he established the firm of Morse & Haynes. It prospered so greatly that it was found desirable to increase its force by the addition of another partner, and the style was changed to Morse, Haynes & Wensley, and thus remained until the firm was dissolved on the death of Mr. Haynes.<br />
Lawyers, as well as other professional men, often run to special- ties in their practice. Such has been the case with Mr. Morse. He has had from the outset a considerable practice in all branches of law, and is accomplished and successful therein; but his chief attention has been given and his chief successes won in corporation and constitutional law. To these his practice has largely turned, and upon them he is a recognized authority. Out- side of his strictly professional labors, Mr. Morse has long given to questions of political and social economy study and research. He has also been interested in much legislation for the welfare of the State. Thus he drafted and secured the passage, in 1895, of the bill for the appointment of commissioners to consider the question of saving the Palisades from defacement and destruction. He also drew up the Palisades National Reservation bills passed in 1896 by the Legislatures of New York and New Jersey, and finally drafted an act for Congress on the same subject. Upon the passage of the legislative act he was appointed by the Governor of New York to be one of three Palisades Commissioners, to act jointly with similar commissioners to be appointed by the Governor of New Jersey, and of the whole joint commission he was chosen secretary and treasurer. This commission made an elaborate report to the Governors of the two States concerned on December 5, 1895. Mr. Morse has also written much in the press on the subject of the preservation of the Palisades, has argued the cause before various committees of Congress, and on request has addressed various business and social organizations on the same subject.<br />
As a public orator Mr. Morse has won frequent praise, his address at the unveiling of the soldiers' monument at Seneca Falls, New York, in 1889, and that on a like occasion at Water- town, New York, in 1890, being especially remembered with much pleasure. A part of the Watertown address may well be quoted:<br />
"Year by year the stillness of peace has mantled fields of tumult. Time has stolen on unheeded, and today the past is with us only as in a dream. Company after company, regiment after regiment, come in memory - men who counted not life too precious nor years too long for the service of their country. Holy their cause and magnificent their achievement. Ages shall know their story and all men share the blessings of their legacy of good. So we have met, and so we bear this shaft, that it may witness how well men loved the right; how gallantly they fought ; how patiently they suffered, not for gain or conquest, not for home or companions, not for themselves or their race - for their country and simple right and justice. Upon us, in another generation, rests the great stewardship of destiny. Ours to preserve inviolate and unshaken in their strength those great truths and principles upon which are built our state and that eternal righteousness of justice in which its foundations rest. And here once more we pledge full faith to our beloved land ! Strong and free in all her wealth of vast domain and virgin soil, the crown of destiny is on her brow, bright as a star radiant in deepest night. Ring through the world the watchwords of her greatness ; Justice to all ! Oppression for none ! To no man a privilege by law ! To every man his freedom and his right, untrammeled and complete ! "<br />
Mr. Morse is president of the Incorporated Morse Society, and a member of the American Academy of Political and Social Science, the American, New York State, and New York City Bar associations, the Society of Colonial Wars, the Sons of the Revolution, the Lawyers' Club, the Quill Club, the Reform Club, and various other organizations both in and out of town. He was married, at Seneca Falls, New York, in 1886, to Miss Adelaide P. Cook, daughter of Albert Cook and Caroline Partridge Cook, the latter a daughter of Erastus Partridge.<br />

You truly loved your wife, children, grand children and great-grand children. You always strived to love, teach and to provide a strong legacy for us, showing deep pride knowing weʼd learned a lesson you had tried to teach us and in everything we accomplished or achieved. Your smile was the gratitude and recognition that we all looked for, because we knew coming from you that was always "high praise." You always welcomed a set of younger feet that filed through that front door and looked forward to the hugs and kisses to follow. We will miss your presence, but will cherish all the "treasures" that you have allowed us to bring along on our walk of life. All of us will miss you dearly ... Love you.<br />

Inherited the greater part of the possession of Miles of Gloucester onthe extinction of his male issue, by marrying his eldest daughterMargaret. He had consistently supported Henry II, notably in 1173, whenhe assisted to defeat and capture the earl of Leicester at Fornham inSuffolk, and his grandson, Henry de Bohun, was rewarded for the loyaltyof his family on 28 April 1200, by a charter granting him 20 poundsyearly from the third penny of the county o f Hereford, thereby makinghim earl thereof, on condition that if King John should have an y heir byhis wedded wife, Henry de Bohun should claim nothing by the charter whichHenry I I gave to Roger of Gloucester. [The Victoria History of theCounties of England: Herefordshire, p. 361]<br />
 <br />
He died in 1187; aide and counselor to Henry I; constable of England; aided Empress Mathilda against King Steven and later reaped the fruits of his choice during the rule of Henry II, with who m he was familiar.<br />
Lord of Trowbridge; very close to Henry I and later Henry II; assisted<br />
Empress Mathilda against King Stephen. b. 1109, d. 6 Apr 1187; m. Margery/Marguerite/Margaret, eldest daughter of Milo of Gloucester , from whom he received the hereditary right to the title of Constable of England.<br />
Humphrey III was steward and chancellor to Henry I, perhaps following his father. He share d this post with Hugh Bigot/Bigod, Robert Haye, and Simon de Beauchamp. Sometimes he is confused with his father.<br />
We can follow Humphrey III in the entourage of King Henry I by the documents he signed a t Arques and Dieppe (1131), various English towns (1131-3), in Normandy at Rouen (1133-4), and at Argentan (1133-4).<br />
When Steven of Blois, Earl of Mortain, was crowned king of England after Henry I d. 1135 , Humphrey kept his duties as steward presiding over charters. Two were written at Evreux in 1137. One concerned infractions against God; the other gave land in Bramford (Suffolk) to St. Mary d'Evreux. In 1139 Empress Mathilda arrived in Sussex with her half-bro Robert of Gloucester to reclaim the inheritance of their father. Humphrey, at the instigation of his fat her-in-law, Milo de Gloucester, rallied with Mathilda and defended Trowbridge against King Steven.<br />
During the troublesome years of the anarchy that followed, Humphrey passionately fought with Mathilda's loyal and true followers. He witnessed Milo being named earl of Hereford in recognition of his services on 25 July 1141.<br />
After initial success, the Battle of Winchester (1141) marked a turnaround and Humphrey was taken prisoner.<br />
In 1143 in Devizes (Wiltshire), Mathilda reinstated possession of lands and the office o f chancellor of England to Humphrey in a written document. She also gave him new wealth and l and: Melchesam, Boczam, Malmesbury, and Stokes-Wiltshire. Humphrey had been relieved of his duties after the reign of Henry I.<br />
Humphrey signed a document of Prince Henry in 1149-50 at Devizes and another in 1150-1 at Argentan.<br />
In 1150 Trowbridge Castle was taken by King Stephen.<br />
When the abbey church of Montebourg was dedicated in 1152, Humphrey consented to the gif t of the church of St. Gregoire de Catz by Ildebert de Catz and Steven de Magneville.<br />
Because of his role as Lord Chancellor and his signatures on numerous documents, we are able to account for Humphrey's whereabouts. He was in England with the king (1153-4), in Normandy (1156) at Argenta, Falaise, and Quevily (1174), with his peers in Chinon (1170-3), back in England (between 1174-9), and again in Normandy at Valognes, Cherbourg, and Bonneville-sur-Touques<br />
(1180-2).<br />
In April 1173 when Prince Henry rebelled against his father, King Henry II, Humphrey stood by the king. With Richard de Lucy he invaded Scotland in an attack against King William the Lion who supported Prince Henry and the destruction of the bishop's palace at Durham. Humphrey and company burned Berwick and penetrated deeply into Scotland. But when they learned of the landing of Robert de Beaumont (earl of Leicester and friend of Prince Henry) in Suffolk (29 Sep 1173), they made a truce with William the Lion and marched against Beaumont. Humphrey battled with the help of the peasants and was taken prisoner with his wife at Fornham St. Genevie re near Bury St. Edmond (Suffolk) on 16 Oct 1173. The prisoners were taken to Falaise Castle.<br />
1 Dec 1174/5 in Falaise, Humphrey witnessed a peace accord between Henry II and William the Lion recognizing the sovereigncy of England over Scotland.<br />
Humphrey's fortune considerably increased with the death of his father-in-law, Milo of Gloucester, who without male heirs left a third of his wealth to each daughter. Humphrey also inherited the position of Constable of England that was held by his father-in-law. In 1166 Humphrey inherited three half parts of a knight's fees (rent) from his grandfather's provinces an d nine half parts "de novo." His wife received 17 parts from Milo's provinces and three 3/4 p arts of her brothers' land.<br />
He kept in Normandy a part of the inheritance from Humphrey I, particularly land at Carentan and Pont D'Ouve. A document confirmed the gifts of his ancestors and the men of the Boho n priory. Among the witnesses of this act were Enjuger de Bohon, Robert of Bohon priory, Duch ess Margaret, and Henry de Bohon.<br />
A letter from Humphrey de Bohon to the men of Normandy and England stated that Humphrey an d his son gave to the Blanchelande Abbey the title of Moulin de Biard with Pont D'Ouve.<br />
In 1181 with Alexander de Bohon he witnessed the foundation of Barbery Abbey.  Across the Channel Humphrey founded the priory of Monkton Farley (Wiltshire) with his wife, supported by the Lewes Abbey. Near the beautiful forests and streams in England, his rich endowment provided them with a large yearly income. Among the benefactors associated with this foundation are Mathilda de Bohon (his mother), Ildebert de Catz (Chaz), Robert de Carentan, and his vassals; among the witnesses were William de Beuzeville an d Humphrey de St. Vigor.<br />
He had a son, Humphrey IV, and a daughter, Margaret, 1st wife of Waleran, Earl of Warwick. [Les Seigneurs de Bohon]<br />

Mr. Chamberlain was born in Dover, Vermont, Aug. 28, 1792, and died agedfifty-seven years. His early life was spent with an uncle in Boston,Mass., by whom he was trained to the mercantile business. When of age hebegan this sort of work for himself with such success as to have thealmost certain prospect of accumulating wealth. He became a member of thePark Street Church in 1818 and his heart was ever afterward drawn towardthe gospel ministry. After consulting with judicious friends he gave uphis mercantile business and commenced a preparatory course of study inthe academy in Andover, Mass., for the ministry. Indications of thedisease that ultimately proved fatal, along with the exigency of themissionary work, led to a change in his life plan. Placing his littleproperty where its avails would help forward the cause of missions, heaccepted an invitation' to join the first reinforcement of the mission tothe Hawaiian Islands and arrived in Honolulu April 27, 1823. He enteredupon his new labors with a self-devotion, which never wavered. He broughtto his work a vigorous mind, a sagacious judgment, a body, though frail,exceedingly active and efficient, and a spirit supremely de- voted to hisRedeemer and the good of his fellow men. His toils were incessant andperplexing, but he shrank from no sacrifice, no self-denial. He was readyto take the lowest place, the poorest fare, the hardest toil; ready to bea hewer of wood and drawer of water in building the temple of the Lord onthose then heathen islands. The range of his mind was by no meansrestricted to the secular concerns of the mission. His correspondencewith his brethren of the mission and his patrons at home touched onalmost every vital interest, and was truly wonderful in its quantity, itsmatter and the neatness and accuracy of its execution. Long and wearisomedays he devoted to the examination of native schools, and being himselfproficient in penmanship he took pleasure in imparting the art to themore advanced of the native pupils. Mr. Chamberlain's experience,judgment and piety gave him influence with his brethren as a counselor.He leaned to the side of self-denial, prudence and caution. His opinionswere frankly and kindly expressed. The Hawaiian Mission suffered a greatloss on July 29, 1849, by the death of Levi Chamberlain who, fortwenty-six years was the senior superintendent of its secular affairs.Probably no man has lived on those islands who was more generallyrespected and beloved. As a husband, as a father, as an agent entrustedwith great responsibilities, as a member of the mission and the foreigncommunity he was the same conscientious, devoted Christian.<br />

Waltheof, 1st Earl of Northampton (d. 1076) was the last of the Anglo-Saxon earls, remaining in England for a decade after the Norman conquest.<br />
 <br />
He was a son of Earl Siward of Northumbria, and, although he was probably educated for a monastic life, became Earl of Huntingdon and Earl of Northumberland about 1065. After the Battle of Hastings he submitted to William the Conqueror; but when Sweyn II of Denmark invaded Northern England in 1069 he joined him with Edgar Ætheling and took part in the attack on York, only, however, to make a fresh submission after their departure in 1070. Then, restored to his earldom, he married William's niece, Judith, and in 1072 was appointed Earl of Northampton.<br />
 <br />
The Domesday Book (ordered to be prepared by William the Conqueror, and finally completed in 1086) mentioned Waltheof ("Walleff"); "'In Hallam ("Halun"), one manor with its sixteen hamlets, there are twenty-nine carucates [~14 km2] to be taxed. There Earl Waltheof had an "Aula" [hall or court]. There may have been about twenty ploughs. This land Roger de Busli holds of the Countess Judith." (Hallam, or Hallamshire, is now part of the city of Sheffield, in the county of South Yorkshire).<br />
 <br />
In 1075 Waltheof joined the conspiracy against the king arranged by the earls of Norfolk and Hereford; but soon repenting of his action he confessed his guilt to Archbishop Lanfranc, and then to William, who was in Normandy. Returning to England with William he was arrested, and after being brought twice before the king's court was sentenced to death. On the 31st of May 1076 he was beheaded on St Giles's Hill, near Winchester. Weak and unreliable in character, Waltheof, like his father, is said to have been a man of immense bodily strength. Devout and charitable, he was regarded by the English as a martyr, and miracles were said to have been worked at his tomb at Crowland. The earl left three daughters, the eldest of whom, Matilda, brought the earldom of Huntingdon to her second husband, David I of Scotland. One of Waltheof's grandsons was Waltheof (d. 1159), abbot of Melrose. His creation of the earldom of Northampton, however, died with him, and he would remain the last to hold a Saxon-era title until the Earl of Wessex nearly a thousand years later.<br />

Sir William Gascoigne (c. 1350-1419) was Chief Justice of England during the reign of King Henry IV. His reputation is that of a great lawyer who in times of doubt and danger asserted the principle that the head of state is subject to law, and that the traditional practice of public officers, or the expressed voice of the nation in parliament, and not the will of the monarch or any part of the legislature, must guide the tribunals of the country.<br />
 <br />
He was a descendant of an ancient Yorkshire family. The date of his birth is uncertain, but it appears from the year-books that he practised as an advocate in the reigns of Edward III and Richard II. When Henry of Lancaster was banished by Richard II, Gascoigne was appointed one of his attorneys, and soon after Henry's accession to the throne was made chief justice of the court of King's Bench. After the suppression of the rising in the north in 1405, Henry eagerly pressed the chief justice to pronounce sentence upon Lord Scrope, the Archbishop of York, and the Earl Marshal Thomas Mowbray, who had been implicated in the revolt. This he absolutely refused to do, asserting the right of the prisoners to be tried by their peers. Although both were later executed, the chief justice had no part in this. It has been doubted whether Gascoigne could have displayed such independence of action without prompt punishment or removal from office.<br />
 <br />
The popular tale of his committing the Prince of Wales (the future Henry V) to prison must also be regarded as unauthentic, though it is both picturesque and characteristic. It is said that the judge had directed the punishment of one of the prince's riotous companions, and the prince, who was present and enraged at the sentence, struck or grossly insulted the judge. Gascoigne immediately committed him to prison, and gave the prince a dressing-down that caused him to acknowledge the justice of the sentence. The king is said to have approved of the act, but it appears that Gascoigne was removed from his post or resigned soon after the accession of Henry V. He died in 1419, and was buried in the parish church of Harewood in Yorkshire. Some biographies of the judge have stated that he died in 1412, but this is disproved by Edward Foss in his Lives of the Judges; and although it is clear that Gascoigne did not hold office long under Henry V, it is not impossible that the scene in the fifth act of the second part of Shakespeare's Henry V has some historical basis, and that the judge's resignation was voluntary.<br />

On the history of the Earldom of Huntingdon:<br />
His [Waltheof's] son-in-law Simon de St Liz was the next holder of the Earldom [of Huntingdon], the family connections of Simon's wife Maudmaking the transition a natural one under the terms prevailing then. Indeed the history of the Earldom over the next few decades amplyillustrates the almost chattel-like nature of such a title at this time,a quasi-hereditary post which was nevertheless as often as not held from the king at pleasure and which could be transferred between members of the same family like a parcel of land.

SHINGLEHOUSE - Funeral services for Robert Lorne (Junior) Hawkes, whodrowned in the Oswayo Creek Thursday afternoon, will be held at theMorton Funeral Home, Saturday at two o'clock, with Dr. J.F. Weinhauer,pastor of the First Baptist Church officiating. Burial will be in LittleGenesee Cemetery.<br />
 The youth, who was born in Olean, February 22, 1921, was the son of Mr. and Mrs. Lorne G. Hawkes of Horse Run. Surviving besides his parents, are eight younger brothers and sisters, all at home. It was reported that the youth had walked out on a log from which swimmers are accustomed to dive into the pool, which is located in the creek at Babbitt Bridge, two miles southeast of Shinglehouse. Nobody was in the pool at the time, which was about one o'clock, it is said. It is believed that Hawkes fell accidentally off the log into the water. He was considered a good swimmer.<br />
 It was estimated that he was in the water from six to ten minutes. Several boys fishing near by spread the alarm and Hollis Nichols, who lived near the scene, recovered Hawkes from the water as Shinglehouse Firemen arrived. Artificial respiration was administered and Olean Firemen were telephoned before the arrival of the Morton ambulance from Shinglehouse.<br />
 A car was dispatched from the Olean Fire Department with an inhalator to meet the ambulance but through a misunderstanding they passed each other in Portville. The youth was brought to the Olean Fire Headquarters in Olean where seven members of the Department worked over him with another inhalator until three o'clock, when he was pronounced dead by Dr. C.D. Hosmer, Coroner.<br />
 Dr. F.P. Keefe of Olean and Dr. J. Emerson Dailey of Houston, visiting in Olean, administered a stimulant direct to the heart of the youth while the inhalator was being used.<br />
 Coroner Hosmer said he did not intend to hold an inquest and gave permission for removal of the body to the Morton Funeral Home at Shinglehouse. He considered the death accidental, estimated Hawkes died enroute to Olean.<br />
 Although preliminary examination of the body revealed no marks, it was thought possibly the youth had struck an object when he fell.<br />

Roger de Quincy, 2nd Earl of Winchester (1195? - April 25, 1265) was anEnglish nobleman.<br />
 <br />
He was the second son of Saer de Quincy, 1st Earl of Winchester, and Margaret de Beaumont.<br />
 <br />
He probably joined his father on the Fifth Crusade in 1219, where the elder de Quincy fell sick and died. His elder brother having died a few years earlier, Roger thus inherited his father's titles and properties. However, he did not take possession of his father's lands until February 1221, probably because he did not return to England from the crusade until then. He did not formally become earl until after the death of his mother in 1235.<br />
 <br />
Roger married Helen, eldest daughter and co-heiress of Alan, Lord of Galloway. After the latter's death in 1234, Galloway was partioned, with Roger and the husbands of his wife's 2 sisters each receiving a third. The Gallwegans rebelled, not wanting their land divided. The rebellion was suppressed by Alexander II of Scotland. Roger ruled his portion of Galloway quite strictly, and the Gallwegans revolted again in 1247, forcing Roger to hole up in a castle. Faced with a siege and little chance of relief, Roger and a few men fought their way out and rode off to seek help from the king, who raised forces to again suppress the rebellion.<br />
 <br />
In the following years Roger was one of the leaders of the baronial opposition to Henry III of England.<br />
 <br />
Roger had 3 daughters, but no sons. After his death his estates were divided between the daughters, and the earldom of Winchester lapsed.<br />
 <br />
Roger married 3 times. His first wife was (as mentioned above) Helen of Galloway, by whom he had the three daughters that became his heiresses. By his last two wives he had no children. The second wife was Maud de Bohun, daughter of Humphrey de Bohun, 2nd Earl of Hereford, and the third wife was Eleanor Ferrers, daughter of William Ferrers, Earl of Derby.<br />
 <br />
The three daughters of Roger and Helen of Galloway were:<br />
    * Helen (also known as Ela), who married Alan Baron Zouche of Ashby;<br />
    * Elizabeth (also known as Isabella), who married Alexander Comyn, 2nd Earl of Buchan;<br />
    * Margaret, who married William Ferrers, Earl of Derby (and was thus stepmother to her stepmother).<br />

Dr. Theodore Pomeroy, who came from Cooperstown, was born at Southampton,Mass., March 14, 1785, was graduated at Yale College in 1808, studiedmedicine with Dr. James, of Albany and afterward of Utica, and also withDr. Chester, of Hudson, attended lectures at Pittsfield, and had made asuccessful stand in Cooperstown.<br />
His new venture in Utica was a fortunate one, for he soon fell into a large and profitable business, and for ten or a dozen years at least was the medical adviser of some of the best families of the place. His pleasant manner and his engaging exterior attracted admirers who were changed to friends when they realized the purity and uprightness of his life. He loved his profession as an art more than as a science. He cared less for brilliant exploits in surgery than to relieve the common ailments of humanity, and win the rewards of his exertion as well as the gratitude of those on whom he waited.<br />
Other pursuits akin to medicine into which he was drawn tended to lead him more and more from his chosen calling and eventually took him wholly out of it. With Thomas R. Walker he had become interested in an oilcloth factory from their having loaned money to J. D. Edwards, its founder, and which the latter was unable to reimburse them. They assumed the charge of the factory and for many years continued its management. After Mr. Walker withdrew, about the year 1854, Dr. Pomeroy kept on in the concern in company with his son Theodore. As a citizen, neighbor, and friend the rank of Dr. Pomeroy was among the liberal, the useful, and the trusted.<br />
He died at St. Anthony, June 26, 1860. His first wife and the mother of three of his children was Mary, daughter of Dr. Thomas Fuller, of Cooperstown. His second was Miss Cornelia Voorhees, of New Brunswick, N. J.<br />

3rd son of Honfroi de Bohun. Ancestor of the earls of Hereford, Sussexand Northampton. The e arls of Northampton were hereditary constables ofEngland. Alliances in the female line wer e made with Thomas ofWoodstock, earl of Gloucester, son of Henry III, and with Henry Bolingbroke, son of John of Gaunt, duke of Lancaster, and subsequently KingHenry IV. [Falaise Roll , p. 57]<br />
Benefitted in the favor of Kings William Rufus and Henry I of England. His marriage to the da u. of Edward of Salisbury gave him much honor and wealth; d. 1129.<br />
The sources for this branch of the Bohons, earls of Hereford, Essex, and Northampton, ar e all English. The name Bohon was changed to Boun, Boon, Bowne, etc. It was later considere d to signify master or boss. Humfridus, Onfroi, and Honfroy are translated as Humphrey.<br />
The frequent repetition of the first name Humphrey causes a lot of confusion. The Englis h begin their line with the first Humphrey born in Great Britain, who is our Humphrey II.<br />
Humphrey II, known as Humphrey the Magnificnt or Humphrey the Great, benefitted from the f avor of King William Rufus. His signature is on a number of papers of Henry I. Thus we can fo llow him around England (1103-1109, then in Normandy at Avranches (1113) and Rouen (1119, the n in England (1121), back to Rouen (1125), and back to England (1128).<br />
Humphrey II gave the church of Bishop Street in Salisbury (Wiltshire) to the Lewes Abbey ( next to Newhaven) and the church of Cheleworth to the St. Dennis priory (Southampton). He wa s a witness at the founding of Savigney Abbey by Ralph de Fougeres.<br />

Baldwin V of Flanders (d. September 1, 1067) was Count of Flanders from 1036 until his death.<br />
 <br />
He was the son of Baldwin IV of Flanders, who died in 1035. He, in turn, is a descendant of Elfrida (d. 949), daughter of Alfred the Great, Saxon King of England.<br />
 <br />
In 1028 Baldwin married Adela (Alix), daughter of King Robert II of France; at her instigation he rebelled against his father but in 1030 peace was sworn and the old count continued to rule until his death. From 1060 to 1067 he was the guardian for his nephew-by-marriage Philip I of France.<br />
 <br />

Baldwin IV of Flanders (980 - May 30, 1036), known as the Bearded, wasCount of Flanders from 988 until his death. He was the son of Arnulf IIof Flanders.<br />
 <br />
Baldwin turned his attentions to the east and north, leaving the southern part of his territory in the hands of his vassals the counts of Guines, Hesdin, and St. Pol.<br />
 <br />
To the east was Lotharingia, and here Baldwin took Valenciennes, the Cambresis, and Hainaut. It was not until 1056, during the minority of the Emperor Henry IV, then he fully secured this territory, which was then recognized as fier held of the emperor.<br />
 <br />
In the more central and northerly parts of Flanders, the count's supremacy was unchallenged. Here there was a great deal of internal reclamation and colonization of marshland, all of which belonged to the counts of Flanders.<br />
 <br />
Baldwin first married Ogive of Luxemburg, by whom he had a son and heir Baldwin V. He later married Eleanor of Normandy, daughter of Richard II of Normandy, by whom he had a daughter Judith. Before Baldwin she had been married to Duke Welf of Bavaria. Their daughter Judith was married toTostig Godwinson, Earl of Northumberland.(*) These widespread family connections demonstrate the political interests of the Flemish counts, both in England to the west and in Germany to the east.<br />

Arnulf II of Flanders (960 or 961 - March 30, 988) was Count of Flandersfrom 965 until his death.<br />
 <br />
He was the son of Baldwin III of Flanders and Matilda of Saxony. Baldwin III died in 962, when Arnulf was just an infant, and with Arnulf's grandfather count Arnulf I of Flanders still alive. When Arnulf I died three years later (965), the regency was held by their kinsman Baldwin Balso.<br />
 <br />
By the time Arnulf attained his majority in 976, Flanders had lost some of the southern territory acquired by Arnulf I. The latter had given some parts of Picardy to King Lothar of France to help assure his grandson's succession, and gave Boulogne as a fief to another relative. Then early in Arnulf's minority Lothar had taken Ponthieu and given it to Hugh Capet, and the first counts of Guines had established themselves.<br />
 <br />
He married Rozala of Lombardy, daughter of Berengar II of Italy, and was succeeded by their son, Baldwin IV.<br />

From Wikipedia<br />
 <br />
Ceawlin of Wessex (also spelled "Ceaulin" or "Caelin") is recorded in the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle as being king of the West Saxons, or Wessex from 560 to 591, and named by Bede in his Historia Ecclesiastica Gentis Anglorum as the second Bretwalda. The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle records his death as occurring in 593.<br />
 <br />
Recent scholars have speculated over the relationship of Ceawlin with the Saxon tribe called the Gewissae, whom Bede located in the upper Thames region near Dorchester-on-Thames. He may have been a member of their ruling dynasty; the surviving genealogies of the Wessex royal line all have contradictions, and scholars suspect that these have been altered to support the claims of descent by later rulers.<br />
 <br />
A fact that has also drawn much comment is the gap of a generation or two between the first Bretwalda Ælle and Ceawlin. This has been cited as supporting Gildas' claim that for over 40 years after the battle of Mons Badonicus the British lived in peace and were secure from major predations from the Anglo Saxon invaders. And if we ignore the raids of Ceredic and his sons in the areas of present-day southern Hampshire and Wiltshire, and acknowledge that the Angles in Bernicia were confined to a single stronghold by the British, this makes sense.<br />
 <br />
Our principal source for the events of his life are the eight entries from the Anglo Saxon Chronicle from 556 to 593. Although the Chronicle itself dates from the final decade of the ninth century, these entries appear to record the skeleton of an older saga. A discussion of these entries follows.<br />
 <br />
556<br />
In this year, Cynric and Ceawlin fought against the British at Beranburh.<br />
 <br />
This is Ceawlin's first appearance in the Chronicle. Cynric was the current king of the West Saxons, and Ceawlin apparently was the junior member in this action. Beranburh is identified with Barbury Camp in the Marlborough Downs, overlooking the valley of Swindon.<br />
 <br />
560<br />
In this year, Ceawlin succeeded to the kingdom of the West Saxons.<br />
 <br />
The Chronicle has no mention of Cynric's death; there is no sign whether Ceawlin's actions in 556 allow him to seize the primacy of the West Saxons, or if the chronicler missed an entry.<br />
 <br />
568<br />
In this year, Ceawlin and Cutha fought against Æthelbert, sending him in flight to Kent, and two aldermen were slain in Wibbandun, Oslaf and Cnebban.<br />
 <br />
Æthelbert here is the Æthelbert of Kent who welcomed the missionary Augustine to Britain. While this entry is consistent with the Chronicle's claim that Æthelbert ruled Kent from 560, the contemporary account of Gregory of Tours indicates that he more likely became king closer to 590. This discrepancy suggests that the Chronicler either modified his source, or that his source did not reflect the original facts here; or that Gregory was mistaken.<br />
 <br />
In any case, the point of this entry was to show that Ceawlin was superior in arms to the better known Æthelbert.<br />
 <br />
Since at least as early as Charles Plummer' edition of the Chronicle, it has been observed that this is the first recorded battle between the Anglo Saxon tribes.<br />
 <br />
Wibbandun up to the early twentieth century was identified with Wimbledon, London, but research in the formation of that place name did not support that identification. Currently, scholarly opinion holds that it is located somewhere south of the Thames, west of the Kent border. It is now considered that the site of the battle was Whitmoor Common, Worplesdon, north of Guildford.<br />
 <br />
Nothing more is known of the aldermen Oslaf and Cnebban.<br />
 <br />
571<br />
In this year, Cuthwulf fought against the British Welsh at Bedcanford and took 4 towns, Lygeanburg, Aegelesburg, Baenesington and Egonesham, and in the same year he passed on.<br />
 <br />
So the Parker manuscript, as well as two others; the Laud manuscript names the West Saxon leader "Cutha". The term "British Welsh" is an attempt to translate the Anglo-Saxon "Bretwalas", which appears in the Chronicle only nine times, including this entry: up to the entry for about year 600, the Chronicler calls the native British inhabitants "Brettas" or British -- except for his entries concerning Aelle -- and "Wealas" or Welsh afterwards<br />
 <br />
Bedcanford up to the early twentieth century was identified with Bedford, but research in the formation of that place name does not support that identification. The four towns, respectively, are the modern Limbury, Aylesbury, Benson, and Eynsham -- all located in the Chiltern Hills. Archeological evidence points to the fact that there was an enclave of British communities around London and Verulamium into the sixth century. This area may be remembered as the Chilternsaete listed in the Tribal Hidage, who were taxed at a valuation of 4000 hides.<br />
 <br />
577<br />
In this year, Cuthwine and Ceawlin fought against the British, and they killed 3 kings Coinmail, Condidan, and Farinmail in the place that is called Deorham. And they captured 3 strongholds, Gloucester, Cirencester and Bathcester.<br />
 <br />
This is the Battle of Deorham. Much has been made that with this battle the Cornish Celts were separated from the Welsh; in actual fact, the Celtic peoples living in those parts of Britain could still travel by land with little significant barrier between them for many more years. The Historia Britonum records one Glast as coming from Litchfield south to found Glastonbury about the time the Mercians conquered part of their kingdom to create Shropshire. More important is the fact that the Anglo-Saxon invaders could now sweep into the Severn valley (as Ceawlin is said to have done several years later) and plunder the inhabitants, while the Celts to the west no longer could as easily penetrate the Cotswolds scarp between Gloucester and Cirencester to return the visit.<br />
 <br />
Deorham has been identified as Dyrham, a village some eight miles north of Bath, and five miles west of the Fosse Way, the Roman road between Bath and Cirencester.<br />
 <br />
It is not clear if the three kings should be matched with one "stronghold" each, or perhaps they were relatives who shared rule over all three. The modern Welsh form of these kings names is Cynvael, Cynddylan, and Ffernvael.<br />
 <br />
584<br />
In this year, Ceawlin and Cutha fought against the British in the place that is named Fethanleag and Cutha was slain. And Ceawlin took many towns and robbed countless bodies, and in anger he returned to his lands.<br />
 <br />
Cutha again appears a final time, thirteen years after his possible death at Bedcanford. It is not clear if the chronicler made a confusion of his source materials, or if Cutha and Cuthwine are different individuals. However the phrase "in anger he returned to his lands" appears to be a line from saga.<br />
 <br />
This event has been interpreted as a sweeping raid up the Severn valley to the location of Fethanleag. Plummer identifies this place name with Faddiley in Cheshire; more recent scholarly research identifies this with Stoke Lyne.<br />
 <br />
592<br />
In this year, there was a great slaughter at Woddesbeorg, and Ceawlin was driven out.<br />
 <br />
(So the Parker manuscript; the Laud manuscript reads "In this year Gregorius succeeded to the papacy in Rome, and there a great slaughter happened in Britain this year at Wodnesbeorg, and Ceawlin was driven out.")<br />
 <br />
Woddesbeorg/Wodnesbeorg is a rare pagan Anglo-Saxon place name. It is identified with the present day Alton Priors seven miles east of Devizes.<br />
 <br />
The chronicler shows that this was a decisive defeat for Ceawlin by dating it only a year prior to his death; all of his other entries concerning Ceawlin are separated by five to seven years. Obviously this exile would also demonstrate that his claim to the title of Bretwalda ended at the same time.<br />
 <br />
Of unknown value is William of Malmesbury's comment that this slaughter at Woddensbeorg was the result of "the Angles and the British conspiring together". We have no other evidence for the identity of Ceawlin's adversary, only the suspicion that his successor Ceolwulf, son of his associate Cutha, might have been involved -- but if that is the case, it is puzzling that would he need until 597 to succeed to the kingship of the West Saxons.<br />
 <br />
593<br />
In this year, Ceawlin, Cuichelm and Crida perished, and Æthelfrith succeeded to the kingdom in Northumbria.<br />
 <br />
By dating Ceawlin's death to the same year Æthelfrith became king of Northumbria, the Chronicler betrays his assumption that the various kings of this early period followed closely upon each other. While the entry of 568 suggests that Ceawlin and Ethelbert were contemporaries, this entry should not be taken as proof that Ceawlin died at the same time Æthelfrith became king.<br />
 <br />
One feature of Ceawlin's activities, similar to other early Anglo-Saxon kings, is that he is frequently mentioned in the company of other individuals. This suggests that although he was renowned as a warrior, his own following was too small for his to effectively wage war by himself, and that he depended on the support of other nobles or kings of the West Saxons. In other words, there was no centralized kingdom of Wessex at this time, instead Wessex was properly a federation of varying closeness of petty rulers.<br />

Mayor of Castile (died 1032 or after 1066) was queen of Navarre. She wasoriginally called Muniadona (or Muñadona) and is variously called Munia(or Muña) Mayor (or just Munia  or Muña). In Spanish, she is calledMuniadona de Castilla. It is said that her husband Sancho III of Navarre(Sancho the Great) renamed her from her contemporary name Muniadona toMayor, for she was the eldest in her family, yet since she had an aunt ofthe same name, the story is clearly apocryphal. She was the daughter ofCount Sancho Garćıa of Castile. Her marriage to Sancho made her Queenconsort of Navarre.<br />
In 1029, the Count Garćıa Sánchez of Castile, Mayor's brother, was assassinated by the Vela family, Castilian exiles in León. Mayor's husband, Sancho the Great, claimed his role as feudal overlord to pass the county to their second son, Ferdinand. Likewise this brought a nominal legitimate claim to the counties of Ribagorza and Sobrarbe to her husband, who has already taken control of them militarily.<br />
Mayor was the mother of four sons and perhaps two daughters:<br />
 <br />
    * King Garćıa Sánchez III of Navarre<br />
    * Ferdinand the Great, king of León and Castile<br />
    * Ramiro, known from a 1020 charter that also names his brother Garćıa and half-brother Ramiro I of Aragon<br />
    * Gonzalo of Sobrarbe and Ribagorza<br />
    * Bernardo<br />
    * Jimena, wife of Bermudo III of León<br />
    * Mayor, wife of Pons of Toulouse<br />

May have been daughter of Wm. Kemp, Jr and Patience (Thacher) Partridgebut the time frames look wrong for this without more date information.<br />
 <br />
A discussion found online and seems apropos:<br />
 <br />
Who is Patience Kemp and what is Her Heritage?<br />
Both articles above deal with this issue. This is a direct quote from t he conclusion of the second one. It has more detail in the citation, if you desire it.<br />
 <br />
"(1) Rev. Thomas Thacher and Elizabeth Partridge, his wife, had no daughter, Patience Thacher.<br />
(2) Elizabeth Partridge, dau. of Rev. Ralph Partridge, married 1st William Kemp, by whom she had a daughter, Patience Kemp, b. ________. William Kemp d. previous to 23 Sep 1641, and hence subsequent to this date h is widow was free to contract a second marriage; which in fact, she did, by marrying on 11 May 1643, Rev. Thomas Thacher, who subsequently, 2 January 1644 -5, became the minister at Weymouth, MA, and remained the re in that capacity until subsequent to the death, on 2 Jun 1664, of Elizabeth partridge h is wife. Rev. Thomas Thacher was born in England 1 May 1 620, and in 1643 w as presumably about the same age as Elizabeth Partridge, who like himself, was born in England (date of birth unknown), and ca me to this country 17 Nov 1636 with her father. Elizabeth Partridge, so on after her coming to this country, married first William Kemp, who h ad reached this country, previous to her arrival, 3 Jun 1635, on the ship James. Soon after h is marriage William Kemp died, leaving but one child, Patience Kemp, and not leaving a son William Kemp, 2d, who never in reality existed at all. Elizabeth Partridge-Kemp, widow of the only William Kemp, shortly after her first husband's death, married on 11 May 164 3, Rev. Thomas Thacher, and her daughter by her first husband, Patience Kemp, became the step-daughter of Rev. Thomas Thacher, and was received in to his family, and brought up by him, and married from his home in Weymouth, MA, on 9 (or 16) De c. 1660, to Samuel Saberry (Seabury), of Duxbury, Plymouth, MN.<br />
 <br />
(3) Samuel Seabury did NOT marry Patience Kemp, dau. of William Kemp, 2 d, (who never existed in the flesh), and of Patience Thacher (who also never existed), but married Patience Kemp, dau. of William Kemp, 1st, (the only William Kemp), and Elizabeth Partridge, his wife, he being her first husband.<br />
 <br />
(4) William Kemp, 2d, and Patience Thacher are two mythical individuals, summoned into existence by early genealogists, in order that by their marriage they could give birth to a Patience Kemp, who was subsequently to marry Samuel Seabury. It was known beyond doubt that Samuel Seabury did marry a Patience Kemp, and so these hypothetical parents were manufactured for her."<br />
 <br />
This situation is described in more detail (a seven page essay and quotation of dozens of sources from all angles) in the New York Genealogic al and Biographical News, Vol. 35, 1904, p. 101-107, with the same conclusion.<br />

Alice m Sir WILLIAM SHELLEY whose 1/4 share in the manor went to the husbands of his wife's sisters (ie probably died without issue). [Seems not - without male issue perhaps.)<br />
---<br />
The Rule in Shelley's Case is an important decision in the law of real property. The litigation was brought about by the settlement made by Sir William Shelley (c. 1480-1549), a judge of the common pleas, of an estate which he had purchased on the dissolution of Sion Monastery. After prolonged argument the celebrated rule was laid down by Lord Chancellor Sir Thomas Bromley, who presided over an assembly of all the judges to hear the case in Easter term 1580-1581. The rule may be stated as follows: when an ancestor by any gift or conveyance takes an estate of freehold and in the same gift or conveyance an estate is limited, either mediately or immediately, to his heirs or the heirs of his body, in such a case the word " heirs " is a word of limitation and not of purchase; that is to say, the estate of the ancestor is not a life or other freehold estate with remainder to the heirs or heirs of the body, but an estate in fee or an estate tail according to circumstances. The rule is a highly technical one, and has led to much litigation and in many cases without a doubt to the defeat of a testator's intentions. It is said to have had its origin in the wish of the law to preserve to the lords their right of wardship, which would have been ousted by the heir taking as purchaser and not as successor. The rule is reported by Lord Coke in i Reports 93 b. (see also Van Grutten v. Foxwell, 1897, A.C. 658).<br />

Álmos (in Croatian and Slovak Almoš) (died 1129) was a Hungarian prince,the son of King Geza I of Hungary, brother of King Kálmán. He heldseveral governmental posts in the Kingdom of Hungary.<br />
 <br />
Between 1084 and 1091 he was the duke of Slavonia; between 1091 and 1095 he was named King of Slavonia (eastern Croatia). In 1095 Kálmán dethroned Álmos, making him the duke of the apanage Nitrian duchy (Tercia pars regni) instead.<br />
 <br />
Álmos, supported by Germany and Bohemia, came in conflict with Kálmán in 1098, after Kálmán had declared himself the king of the whole of Croatia in 1097 (crowned in 1102). On August 21, 1104 Álmos married Predslava, the daughter of Svyatopolk II of Kiev.<br />
 <br />
Kálmán made peace with Álmos in 1108, but only to have Álmos and his son Béla imprisoned in 1108 or 1109 and then blinded to prevent them from becoming the future king. Álmos died in captivity, but his son would succeed as king of Hungary.<br />
 <br />
Álmos was the last duke of Nitra (in Hungarian Nyitra), his removal also marks the end of the Nitrian Frontier Duchy and thus a full integration of the territory of Slovakia into Hungary.<br />

From Wikipedia<br />
 <br />
John de Warenne (1231?- September 27, 1304), 7th Earl of Surrey or Warenne, was prominent during the reigns of Henry III and Edward I. During his long life he fought in the Barons' War and in Edward I's wars in Scotland.<br />
 <br />
He was the son of William de Warenne, Earl of Surrey or Warenne, and Maud (or Matilda) Marshal. His mother was the daughter of William Marshal and widow of Hugh Bigod, 3rd Earl of Norfolk. Thus Roger Bigod, 4th Earl of Norfolk, was his elder half-brother.<br />
 <br />
Warenne was a boy when his father died, and for the rest of his minority Peter of Savoy was the guardian of his estates. In 1247 he married Henry III's half-sister Alice de Lusignan. This marriage was to create resentment amongst the English nobility, who did not like seeing a wealthy English nobleman marrying a penniless outsider.<br />
 <br />
During the following years Warenne was closely associated with the court faction centering on his in-laws. In 1254 he accompanied the king's son Edward (the future Edward I) on Edward's journey to Spain to marry Eleanor of Castile.<br />
 <br />
During the conflicts between Henry III and his barons Warenne started as a strong supporter of the king, switched to support for Simon de Montfort, and then returned to the royalist party. He opposed the initial baronial reform plan of May 1258, but along with other opponents capitulated and took the oath of the Provisions of Oxford.<br />
 <br />
By 1260 Warenne had joined the party of Simon de Montfort, but switched back to the king's side in 1263. After the Battle of Lewes, which was fought near his castle at Lewes, he fled to the Continent, where he remained for about a year. He returned to fight in the campaign which culminated in the Battle of Evesham and the siege of Kenilworth Castle.<br />
 <br />
Warenne served in Edward I's Welsh campaigns in 1277, 1282, and 1283. In 1282 he received the lordships of Bromfield and Yale in Wales. A good part of the following years were spent in Scotland. He was one of the negotiators for the 1289 treaty of Salisbury and for the 1290 treaty of Brigham, and accompanied the king on Edward's great 1296 invasion of Scotland.<br />
 <br />
On August 22, 1296 the king appointed him "warden of the kingdom and land of Scotland". However he returned to England a few months later claiming that the Scottish climate was bad for his health. The following spring saw the rebellion of William Wallace, and after much delay Warenne led an army northward, where they were defeated at the Battle of Stirling Bridge.<br />
 <br />
Nevertheless the king appointed Warenne captain of the next campaign against the Scots in early 1298. He raised the siege of Roxburgh and re-took the castle at Berwick. The king himself took the field later that year, and Warenne was one of the commanders at the Battle of Falkirk.<br />
 <br />
Warenne and Alice de Lusignan had three children:<br />
    * Alice, who married Henry Percy and was the mother of Henry Percy, 1st Baron Percy of Alnwick;<br />
    * Isabella, who married John Balliol and was the mother of Edward Balliol;<br />
    * William, who married Joanna, daughter of Robert de Vere, earl of Oxford, and was accidentally killed at a tournament on December 15, 1286; his son John succeeded his grandfather as earl of Surrey.<br />

Hamelin de Warenne (d. May 7, 1202) was an English nobleman who was prominent at the courts of the Angevin kings of England, Henry II, Richard I, and John.<br />
 <br />
He was an illegitimate son of Geoffrey of Anjou, and thus a half-brother of Henry II, and an uncle of Richard I and John. His half-brother Henry gave him one of the wealthiest heiresses in England, Isabella de Warenne, in her own right Countess of Surrey. She was the widow of William of Blois. Hamelin and Isabella married on in April 1164, and after the marriage he was recognized as Earl of Warenne, that being the customary designation for what more technically should be Earl of Surrey. In consequence of the marriage Hamelin took the de Warenne toponymic, as did his descendents.<br />
 <br />
Hamelin joined in the denunciations of Thomas Becket in 1164, although after Becket's death he became a great believer in Becket's sainthood, having, the story goes, been cured of blindness by the saint's help. In 1167 he escorted his niece Joan of England to Sicily for her marriage.<br />
 <br />
He remained loyal to Henry through all the problems of the later part of the king's reign when many nobles deserted him, and continued as a close supporter of his nephew Richard I. During Richard's absence on the Third Crusade he took the side of the regent William Longchamp. Hamelin appeared in the 2nd coronation of King Richard in 1194 and at King John's coronation in 1199.<br />
 <br />
He died in 1202 and was succeeded by his son William de Warenne, 6th Earl of Surrey. A daughter was the mistress of her cousin King John of England, and by him the mother of Richard Fitz Roy.<br />

Edith of Scotland, (c.1080-May 1, 1118) was the wife of Henry I of England. She was the daughter of Malcolm III of Scotland and St. Margaret of Scotland. Robert Curthose had stood as godfather at her christening.<br />
 <br />
When she was about six-years-old Edith and her sister, Mary, were sent to Romsey, where their aunt Christina was abbess. During her stay at Romsey and Wilton, Edith was much sought-after as a bride; she turned down proposals from both William de Warenne, 2nd Earl of Surrey, and Alan Rufus, Lord of Richmond. Hermann of Tournai even claims that William Rufus considered marrying her.<br />
 <br />
After the death of King William Rufus in August 1100, his brother Henry quickly seized the royal treasury and the royal crown. His next task was to marry, and Henry's choice fell on Edith. Because Edith had spent most of her life in a nunnery, there was some controversy over whether or not she had been veiled as a nun. Henry sought permission for the marriage from Archbishop Anselm of Canterbury, who returned to England in September 1100 after a long exile. Edith testified to the archbishop that she had never taken holy vows. She insisted that her aunt Christina had veiled her only to protect her "from the lust of the Normans". Edith claimed she had pulled the veil off and stamped on it, and her aunt beat and scolded her most horribly for this. Archbishop Anselm concluded that Edith had never been a nun, and gave his permission for the marriage.<br />
 <br />
Edith and Henry seem to have known one another for some time before their marriage -- William of Malmesbury states that Henry had "long been attached" to her, and Orderic Vitalis says that Henry had "long adored" Edith's character. Through her mother she was descended from Edmund II of England; this was very important as Henry wanted to help make himself more popular with the English people and Edith represented the old English dynasty. In their children the Norman and Anglo-Saxon dynasties would be united.<br />
 <br />
Edith and Henry were married on November 11, 1100 at Westminster Abbey by Archbishop Anselm of Canterbury. She was crowned as "Matilda", a fashionable Norman name. She and Henry had two children:<br />
   1. Maud, born February 1102<br />
   2. William Adelin, born 1103<br />
 <br />
She maintained her court primarily at Westminster, but accompanied her husband in his travels all across England, and in 1106/1107, Edith visited Normandy with Henry. Her court was filled with musicians and poets; she commissioned Turgot to write a biography of her mother, Saint Margaret. She was an active queen, and like her mother was renowned for her devotion to religion and the poor. William of Malmesbury describes her as attending church barefoot at Lent, and washing the feet and kissing the hands of the sick. After her death in 1118 she was remembered by her subjects as "Matilda the Good Queen" and "Matilda of Blessed Memory", and for a time sainthood was sought for her, though she was never canonized. Henry married again four years after her death.<br />

Garćıa Sánchez Abarca of Navarre (d. 1000), called "the Trembling," wasbriefly King of Pamplona 994-1000.<br />
 <br />
He was the son of King Sancho Garcés II Abarca and Queen Urraca Fernández of the family of the Counts of Castilla. He married Jimena Fernández, daughter of Count Fernando Vermúdez of Cea and his wife Elvira. Among their children were the future king Sancho Garcés III and Urraca, later the second wife of Alfonso V of Leon.<br />
 <br />
He tried to escape the submission his father had offered to Córdoba, as a result of which he had to face Almanzor. In 996 he was forced to seek peace in Córdoba.<br />
 <br />
Towards the year 997, during an expedition of Pamplonans to the land of Calatayud, Garćıa killed the governor's brother. Almanzor took revenge by killing 50 Christians.<br />
 <br />
In the Battle of Cervera in July 1000, he allied with Count Sancho Garćıa of Castile, Alfonso V of Leon and Garćıa Gómez of Carrión.From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia<br />

 <br />
Garćıa Sánchez II, sometimes Garćıa II, III, IV or V (died 1000-1004), called the Trembling, the Tremulous, or the Trembler (in Spanish, el Temblón) by his contemporaries, was the king of Pamplona and count of Aragón from 994 until his death. He was the son of King Sancho II and Urraca Fernández.<br />
 <br />
Throughout his reign, his foreign policy seems to have been closely linked to that of Castile. His mother was aunt of count Sancho Garćıa of Castile, and also of the powerful count of Saldaña, Garćıa Gómez of Carrión, and she appears to have played a role in forming a bridge between the kingdom and county.<br />
 <br />
He joined his cousin Sancho in attempting to break from the submission his father had offered to Córdoba, as a result of which he had to face Almanzor. In 996 he was forced to seek peace in Córdoba. In 997 during an expedition into the land of Calatayud, Garćıa killed the governor's brother. Almanzor took revenge by beheading 50 Christians. At the Battle of Cervera in July 1000, he joined, along with count Garćıa Gómez of Saldaña, in a coalition headed by count Sancho Garćıa of Castile that was defeated by Almanzor (that count Sancho led the group is thought to reflect Garćıa's decline). Tradition names him one of the Christian leaders at the 1002 Battle of Calatañazor, which resulted in the death of Almanzor and the consequent crisis in the Caliphate of Córdoba, but there is no contemporary record of him after 1000, while his cousin Sancho Raḿırez of Viguera may have been ruling in Pamplona in 1002. Garćıa was certainly dead by 1004, when his son Sancho Garcés III first appears as king.<br />
 <br />
Domestically, he granted the rule in Aragon to his brother Gonzalo, under the tutelage of his mother Urraca.[1] A tradition reports that he freed all of the Muslim captives being held in the kingdom. He had married by August 981, Jimena, daughter of Ferdinand Vermúdez, count of Cea by Elvira D́ıaz (aunt of count Garćıa Gómez of Saldaña). Among their children were the future king Sancho and Urraca, later the second wife of Alfonso V of Leon.<br />
