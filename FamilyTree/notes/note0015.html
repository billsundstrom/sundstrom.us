Helgi means holy and is an old Nordic name still used in e.g. Iceland.<br />
 <br />
Helgi or Halga (Beowulf), Proto-Norse *Hailagaz, was a Danish Scylding/Skjöldung king. He was the son of Halfdan (Healfdene), the brother of Hróar (Hrothgar) and the father of Hrólf Kraki (Hrothulf).<br />
 <br />
Helgi was killed in battle by the Swe<br />

From Wikipedia<br />
 <br />
Halfdan ("half dane") (Old Norse sources) or Healfdene (Beowulf) or Haldan (Danish Latin sources) was a legendary king of Denmark of the Skjöldung (Scylding) lineage, the son of king named Fródi in many accounts, noted mainly as the father to the two kings who succeeded him in the rule of Denmark, kings named Hrothgar and Halga and the Old English poem Beowulf and named Hróar and Helgi in Old Norse accounts.<br />
 <br />
According to the Chronicon Lethrense and Saxo Grammaticus' Gesta Danorum (Book 2), Halfdan had two brothers named Ro and Skat who also sought the throne. Both were killed by Halfdan. Saxo adds that his brothers' supporters were hanged and that Halfdan continued to reign with great cruelty, but that he reigned long and died peaceably in extreme old age.<br />
 <br />
The Ynglinga saga gives Halfdan (in this work also son of a king named Fródi) a brother named Fridleif and says both were great warriors but that Halfdan was the better of the two. This might have been a lead-in to a feud between the brothers if Snorri had been dealing with Danish matters rather than Swedish matters.<br />
 <br />
Snorri here only tells us that Halfdan attacked King Aun of Sweden and drove him into exile into Götaland. Halfdan then ruled Sweden for twenty years until he died in Uppsala of sickness and was buried in a mound.<br />
 <br />
According to Ynglinga saga, a Danish king named Fródi the Bold aided Aun's successor Egil against the rebelling thrall Tunni. This may be Froda the Heathobard of Beowulf who becomes Fródi the slayer of Halfdan in other Norse traditions which do not make his end peaceful.<br />
 <br />
In the Saga of Hrolf Kraki, this Fródi is Halfdan's younger brother but in the Latin epitome to the Skjöldunga Saga the younger brother, here a half-brother, is named Ingjalldus and this Ingjalldus is later father of a son named Frothi. Since in Beowulf Froda is father of a son named Ingeld, it is usually considered that the names have accidently been interchanged in the tradition behind the Skjöldunga Saga. In the Saga of Hrolf Kraki, Fródi brother of Halfdan is ruler of a separate kingdom. Halfdan was calm and good-natured but Fródi was cruel and vicious. Fródi attacked Halfdan's hall by night and burned it. Halfdan was killed in the battle and Fródi took over his country and his widow.<br />
 <br />
But eventually Halfdan's sons in turn killed Fródi to avenge their father's death. Thus the tradition in Beowulf of a feud between the Danes and Heathobards in which Fróda king of the Heathobards was slain appears in Norse texts as a family feud in which Halfdan's brother Fródi kills Halfdan and Halfdan's sons kill Fródi.<br />

Wallace Anderson: Part I<br />
by The Bagpipe Staff on February 2, 2005<br />
By Laura Kaufmann<br />
 <br />
A young boy watched as his father removed the "whites only" sign from above his storeʼs drinking fountain, telling his son that it just wasnʼt right. The boy would learn that to be an agent of change, one must take initiative; and, often, do it alone.<br />
For the past three years, Wallace Roy Anderson II, the vice president of admissions and enrollment, has been changing Covenant College from a desk in an office across the hall from the financial aid office. Nearly everyone has heard of him, and even a few recognize his cheerful greeting. But not many know him.<br />
Anderson entered the world 55 years ago in the nucleus of the Deep South. His father co-owned two grocery stores and a variety store in Savannah, Georgia, offering the family a comfortable middle class life, including a three bedroom house and a swimming pool in the backyard. It was, according to Anderson, an "average Baptist home," where he and his sister Cathie, three years his elder, were raised.<br />
Anderson attended public school in the primary grades, transferred to a Christian school for a few years, and then finished his education at a public high school. Though he seemed to be doing well, Anderson was troubled.<br />
"I was a difficult child," he said. "My mother has often said that if they had known what ADD [Attention Deficit Disorder] was back then she would have bought the Ritalin company." Because of his short attention span, Anderson rarely listened to music, and hemophilia-B prevented him from playing most sports.<br />
"He was kind of a loner," said his wife of 15 years, Paige.<br />
Anderson got a taste of his future in the Reformed camp when the Covenant College choir performed in Savannah. His aunt, Geane Baker, was deeply moved and suggested Covenant to his sister Cathie. The next year, Cathie decided to attend and became a Christian here in the early 1960ʼs.<br />
"I heard her testimony not too long ago," said Anderson. "She really understood Reformed theology from Collyn Schmidt, who taught her one summer that cleaning toilets was for the glory of God. She said she thought that was the strangest thing she had ever heard, but Collyn kept explaining it until she understood."<br />
When Anderson graduated from high school, he enrolled at Georgetown, a Baptist college in Kentucky, for two semesters. But his sisterʼs experience at Covenant inspired his parents to send him here.<br />
"I credit the seeds that were planted here even though I was on the fringes constantly," he said. "I wanted to be like everybody here, even though I knew I wasnʼt. I longed for what they had."<br />
Yet as a non-believer, Anderson separated himself from the community, spending time on extra-curricular activities. He took a job as a chauffeur for the head of the Republican National Committee Harry Carbaugh. He also sat with an elderly man in Chattanooga and stayed with him at night to care for him.<br />
Anderson studied music here for two and a half semesters, struggling to meet academic standards. Former music professor John Hamm and his wife Esther mentored him during that period.<br />
"Every Saturday in high school, for 16 weeks in a row, he went to the theatre and watched The Sound of Music," Mrs. Anderson said. "Thatʼs when he fell in love with music."<br />
Anderson confirmed that passion. "It softened me up a bit," he said. "And I needed softening."<br />
He first encountered Francis Schaeffer at Covenant. "Part of the reason I hated Covenant was that I had to listen to a man in knickers," he said. He did not perceive then that many years down the road Schaefferʼs works would change his life.<br />
Arline Wetzel (now Cadwell) knew Anderson from working in student development.<br />
"We just knew all the students," Cadwell said. She recalled that Anderson endeared himself to many people and exuded self-confidence. One of his goals was to get Cadwell to develop a deep appreciation for music.<br />
"He was very contagious about music," she said. "There always seemed to be a lot of action going on around him."<br />
Even so, Cadwell was one of few people who knew him closely, and disconnectedness from the Covenant community, among other things, perpetuated his proclivity for rule-breaking. He left midway through his third semester and finished his undergraduate degree in music at Statesboro University in Georgia.<br />
Though she lost touch with Anderson after college, Cadwell recognizes the difference the years have made. "I marvel at the way God has worked in his life since those days," she said.<br />

The tragic death of Mrs. Clifford Thielbar early Sunday evening, Jan. 18, came as a great shock and cast gloom over the whole community. Mrs. Thielbar was up for the first time that day since the birth of her daughter January 3. She seemed to be feeling well and was in good spirits. Her mother, who had been staying with her, left for home only a hlaf hour before her death. Mrs. Thielbar fell suddenly headlong, striking her head on the radiator. A fractured skull resulted from the fall, but Mrs. Thielbar is believed to have died instantly before falling.<br />

In 1922, he sold his share in the business and bought a farm 4 1/2 miles southeast of Dundas. This was their home until October, 1928, when they again moved to Dundas and Mr. Thielbar became the sole owner of the Thielbar Mercantile company.<br />
Mrs. Thielbar was a lifelong member of the Methodist church. She also belonged to the Rebekah lodge in Dundas.<br />

Thomas Roote 2<br />
(16 Jan 1604/05 - 17 Jun 1694)<br />
  1  He married Sarah Clark in Hartford, CT, about 1639. Sarah was born in England about 1620. Sarah died after 1712 in Lebanon, New London, CT. The reference to Sarah Clark as Thomas Roote's wife is unproven. Another researcher suggests that her name may have been Elizabeth, with no known surname.<br />
 <br />
There is also no known date or place of marriage, and no one other than Thomas, signed the Church Covenant of Northampton in 1661.<br />
 <br />
  Thomas Roote was one of the original petitioners to the General Court, to "inhabit and plante Nonotuck". He and his family removed from Hartford to Northampton in 1654/55, becoming early settlers of that town. He is reported to have had six sons and one daughter, all born in Hartford. His wife is listed as Sarah Clark, but that is definitely disputed by many Roote researchers.<br />
 <br />
  From J.R. Trumbull's "History of Northampton" -<br />
 <br />
"Thomas Roote was at Salem in 1637, at Hartford two years afterwards, and removed to Northampton in 1655. He was among the first settlers to arrive here, and was one of the signers of the original petition to inhabit Nonotuck. A quiet, substantial farmer, though a weaver by trade, he never arrived at the position of leader. He was several times elected a selectman, and was one of the officers of the town when careful men were in demand. His home lot was on the easterly side of Pleasant Street, below what is now Pearl Street. He died in 1694, at the advanced age of 84 years. He had six sons and one daughter, all born before he removed to Northampton."<br />
 <br />
  From "Root Genealogical Records" originally published in 1870 by James Pierce Root.<br />
 <br />
"Thomas Roote, believed to be the son of John Roote and Mary Ann Russell of Badby, England, born Jan. 16, 1605, came to this country about the year 1637, and was among the first settlers of Hartford, CT, where he lived many years, and where his children were born, although on account of the incompleteness of the ancient records of Hartford, as they have come down to this generation, the birth of only one of them (John) is recorded. This Thos. Roote is to be distinguished from the Thomas Rootes who was a resident of Salem, Mass., about the same period, and who remained there until his death."<br />
 <br />
  "Thomas Roote (probably this settler of Hartford) went to Pequot in 1637, as a soldier," says Hon. R. H. Hinman.<br />
 <br />
"The name of Thom. Roote is mentioned in the list of proprietors of undivided lands in 1639, and may be found on the monument in the old grave-yard in Hartford, in the rear of the Center Church, erected by the Ancient Burial Ground Association in memory of the first settlers of the city. He was a considerable landholder there, and one parcel fo the land assigned to him was located on what is now [1870] North Main street, about a mile west of the State House. After a residence of about fifteen years in Hartford he removed with his six sons and one daughter, and settled in Northampton, Mass., on the 9th day of May, 1654, as one of the planters of what was then called Nonotuck. In the Massachusetts Colonial Documents we find that in 1659, on petition, he was appointed one of the selectmen.<br />
 <br />
"He was both farmer and weaver of cloth. His record of lands assigned him by the town is dated 7th Dec., 1659. On the 18th of June, 1661, the parish church was gathered, and the Rev. Eleazar Mather was ordained as pastor and teacher of the flock. Among the eight pillars of the church thus organized was Thomas Roote. It is believed by some that he was a deacon of the church. The old Root homestead in Northampton was on King street, opposite where the Roman Catholic church now stands, and it has only within a few years been torn down. Thomas Roote died at a very advanced age, on the 17th of July, 1694, age 89, naming his children in his will, and mentioning that he lived with his son Jonathan at the old homestead. The name of Thomas Roote's wife is not known."<br />
 <br />
  2  "Thomas came to America on the ship Increase in 1637, living initially in Salem, MA. He was one of the founders of Hartford, CT. In 1639, his home lot was on the east side of the cow pasture (North Main Street). He was a farmer and a weaver. Along with John Holloway, he was elected as a chimney viewer in Hartford in 1648. He also served in the Pequot war (French and Indian War). His name may be found on the monument in the old grave yard in Hartford, in rear of the Center Church, erected by the Ancient Burial Ground Association in memory of the first settlers of the city. Thomas moved to Northampton, MA on 9 May 1654, where he became one of the eight "pillars of the church" under Reverend Eleazar Mather, Deacon of the church. He was a selectman in 1659. He is referred to as one of the planters of Nonatuck, the original Indian name for the town of Northampton. His wife's name is not known. Thomas died at age 89 while living with his son Jonathan at the old homestead on King Street.<br />

In Norse mythology, Frigg or Frigga was said to be "foremost among thegoddesses," 1 the wife of Odin, queen of the Æsir, and goddess of thesky. One of the Ásynjur, she is a goddess of marriage, motherhood,fertility, love, household management, and domestic arts. Her primaryfunctions in the Norse mythological stories are as wife and mother, butthese are not her only functions. She has the power of prophecy althoughshe does not tell what she knows 2, and is the only one other than Odinwho is permitted to sit on his high seat Hlidskjalf and look out over theuniverse. She also participates in the Wild Hunt (Asgardreid) along withher husband. Frigg's children are Baldr, Hod and Wecta; her stepchildrenare Hermod, Heimdall, Tyr, Vidar, Vali, and Skjoldr. Thor is either herbrother or a stepson. Frigg's compainion is Eir, the gods' doctor andgoddess of healing. Frigg's attendants are Hlin (a goddess ofprotection), Gna (a messenger goddess), and Fulla (a fertility goddess).It is unclear whether Frigg's companions and attendants are simplydifferent aspects of Frigg herself. (c.f. avatar.) According to the poemLokasenna Frigg is the daughter of Fjorgyn (masculine version of "Earth,"c.f. feminine version of "Earth," Thor's mother), her mother is notidentified in the stories that have survived.<br />

Berengar of Ivrea (?-966), sometimes also referred to as Berengar II ofItaly was marquess of Ivrea, and later King of Italy. He was laterdeposed by the Emperor Otto I, and Italy came under direct control of theHoly Roman Empire.<br />
 <br />
At the death of king Lothaire II of Italy in 950, Berengar seized the opportunity and declared himself King. He tried to legitimize his rule by forcing Adelaide, the respective daughter, daughter-in-law, and widow of the last three kings of Italy, into marriage with his son Adalbert. Adelaide's requests for intervention resulted in Otto I's invasion in 951, where Berengar was forced to pay homage to the Emperor. Otto, a widower, subsequently married Adelaide.<br />
 <br />
Berengar continued in his position as a vassal of the Empire. He intrigued with Pope John XII against Otto, and was eventually captured and imprisoned in 963.<br />

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia.<br />
 <br />
Arnulf I of Flanders (c.890-March 27, 965), known as Arnulf the Great, was the third count of Flanders.<br />
 <br />
Arnulf was the son of count Baldwin II of Flanders and Ælfthryth, daughter of Alfred the Great. He was named after his distant ancestor, Saint Arnulf of Metz; this was intended to emphasize his family's descent from the Carolingian royal house.<br />
 <br />
Arnulf greatly expanded Flemish rule to the south, taking all or part of Artois, Ponthieu, Amiens, and Ostravent. He exploited the conflicts between Charles the Simple and Robert I of France, and later those between Louis IV and his barons.<br />
 <br />
In his southern expansion Arnulf inevitably had conflict with the Normans, who were trying to secure their northern frontier. This led to the 942 murder of the Duke of Normandy, William Longsword, at the hands of Arnulf's men.<br />
 <br />
The Viking threat was receding during the later years of Arnulf's life, and he turned his attentions to the reform of the Flemish government.<br />
 <br />
In 934 he married Adèle (Attala) of Vermandois, daughter of Heribert II of Vermandois. Their children were:<br />
   1. Baldwin III of Flanders<br />
   2. Luitgard, married Wichmann, Count of Ghent<br />
   3. Egbert, died 953<br />
   4. Elftrude, married Siegfried, Count of Guines<br />
 <br />
Arnulf made his eldest son and heir Baldwin III of Flanders co-ruler in 958, but Baldwin died untimely in 962, so Arnulf was succeeded by Baldwin's infant son, Arnulf II of Flanders.<br />

Per Claude Armstrong:<br />
As for my Clewett grandparents, my mother made a large scrapbook photo and illustration record of their "Caravan" move from the back-breaking labor of creating cirus groves in San Fernando Valley to a twenty acre plot the Oakdale Irrigation District opened up for settlers to farm, and thereby develop  the fertile San Joaquin Valley of Central California, in the mid-twenties. As it turned out, that miserable soil was very shallow topsoil sitting on a bed of hardpan, and and all but barely manageable as irrigated farmland. They nicknamed it "Boot-shovel" after years of hard-labor farming it, and losing. Grandpa then bought and developed a state-of-the-art goat dairy in Ripon, in the heart of Central California Wine Country. He was deeply Quacker-oriented [Friends Church], and a complete tee-totaler! As babies arrived after me, mom used to have dad take us the twenty-some miles to grandpa and grandma's little three or so acre goat dairy [They managed to have as many as 120 milking nannies there!], and my brother and I would spend many, many three to ? weeks in their care. The fall-out from that detachment from my home raised major havoc with my sense of allegiance the rest of my days - so far!<br />
The Central California major highway, Highway 99, ran just a few hundred feet away, as did the main Central California railroad, next to the highway. On many occasions I remember arriving at my grandparents to find a hobo living there, doing some contrived odd-jobs, for grandma's cooking, which was carefully stored for after they left on the numerous passing freight trains. Grandpa was ever so mindful of his own wretched-poor beginnings, and had established a name among the poor traveling homeless as a place of welcome, for an exchange of small labor favors. The dairy was state-of-the-art concrete and stainless steel milk-piping, but it only afforded an eked-out financial existence all their many years there. Their main food staples came in the form of grocery store trimmings, almond huller wastes, and fruit packing house discards. Even so, I always remember them buying 5+ five-gallon square tins of honey to sweeten all grandma's wonderful baked goods, including the most awesome bread I've ever tasted, except for the equally-awesome bread my children's mom produced!<br />
And, ice goat milk? I can recall no better-tasting milk treat! Grandpa had a pre-chiller that the incoming stainless steel milk pipes emptied onto, with a commercial refrigerator running to maintain its coolth. The fresh, warm milk ran down its horizontal corrugated sides, chilling it to about 40 degrees, or so, just before it was fed into those old Galvanized bulk milk cans . . .<br />
 . . . From the "Milk Room," grandpa tipped each filled, heavy 10-gallon can and rolled them into a large cold-storage room to keep till the goat dairy co-op route truck backed into the raised dock to pick up however many milkings'-worth of milk was there. They had several centrifugal cream separators in the milk parlor, but I never saw them in use, and I really doubt they were used. Oh! that iced goat milk? As the milk ran over the very cold pre-chiller, over time the thinner milk at the ends of the corrugated chiller would freeze. All I had to do was chip off some flakes, and suck on them like an icicle. Yum!<br />
I've many, many memories of grandpa and grandma Clewett's visits! Dad's parents died when he was young, his mom when he was just two, and he was ten when his dear old, worn-to-the-bone father just gave up on living, in the most barren place I've ever been to, Elida, New Mexico. Perhaps the Chaco Canyon region is as barren, but at least high-desert sage grows there! Dad's stories of the horrors of a Star Route Mail Carrier, which his father took as a new immigrant, hoping for a better life from the serfdom of 19th century, industrialized England - well, that's another, long, long story!<br />
My folks were survivors! How I wish I'd respected and honored my dear parents before it was too late to do so. Mom passed just after my birthday, Feb 19, 2008 - I dreamed with a vivid scene of dad singing a beautiful solo that night, and I rarely, if ever, dreamed anything with my dad in it. Dad had gone on in the Fall of 1984, just days before Grandma Clewett passed over. He was 77; she, 93, the same age as my mom at her passing.<br />

Baldwin II of Flanders (c. 865 -September 10, 918), nicknamed Calvus (theBald) was the second count of Flanders. He was also hereditary abbot ofSt. Bertin from 892 till his death.<br />
 <br />
He was the son of Baldwin I of Flanders and Judith, a daughter of Charles the Bald.<br />
 <br />
The early years of Baldwin's rule were marked by a series of devastating Viking raids. Little north of the Somme was untouched. Baldwin recovered, building new fortresses and improving city walls, and taking over abandoned property, so that in the end he held far more territory, and held it more strongly, than had his father. He also took advantage of the conflicts between Charles the Simple and Odo, Count of Paris to take over the Ternois and the Boulonnias.<br />
 <br />
In 884 Baldwin married Aelfthryth (Ælfthryth, Elftrude, Elfrida), a daughter of King Alfred the Great of England. The marriage was motivated by the common Flemish-English opposition to the Vikings, and was the start of an alliance that was a mainstay of Flemish policy for centuries to come.<br />
 <br />
He died at Blandimberg and was succeeded by his eldest son Arnulf I of Flanders. His younger son Adalulf was the first count of Boulogne.<br />

Baldwin I of Flanders (d. 879), also known as Baldwin Iron Arm, was thefirst count of Flanders.<br />
 <br />
Baldwin was the son of Odacre, and had been created first count of Flanders in 862. Baldwin rose to prominence when he eloped with Judith, daughter of Charles the Bald. (Judith had previously been married to Ethelwulf and his son Ethelbald, kings of Wessex.) Charles was not pleased, and he had Baldwin excommunicated. Baldwin responded by traveling to Rome to plead his case to Pope Nicholas I. When this was granted Charles relented and accepted the marriage. To give Baldwin proper status, Charles made him count of Ghent. In the following years Baldwin was also given the counties of Ternois and Flanders.<br />

From Wikipedia<br />
 <br />
Halfdan Hvitbeinn (Old Norse: Hálfdan hv́ıtbeinn) was the son of Olof Trätälja of the House of Yngling according to Heimskringla. He lived around A.D. 710.<br />
 <br />
His father was sacrificed to Odin by the Swedish settlers in Värmland because of a famine. Some Swedes, however, realised that the famine was brought by overpopulation and not by the fact that the king had been neglecting his religious duties.<br />
 <br />
Consequently, they resolved to cross the Ed Forest and settle in Norway and happened to end up in Soleyar where they killed king Sölve and took Halfdan prisoner. The Swedish expatriates elected Halfdan king as he was the son of their old king, Olof. Halfdan subjugated all of Soleyar and took his army into Romerike and subjugated that province as well.<br />
 <br />
Halfdan was to become a great king, who married Åsa, the daughter of king Eystein, the ruler of Oppland and Hedmark. They had two sons, Öystein Halfdansson and Gudröd.<br />
 <br />
Halfdan conquered a large part of Hedemark, Toten, Hadeland and a part of Vestfold. When his brother Ingjald Olofsson died, he inherited Wermelandia. Halfdan died of old age in Toten and was transported to Vestfold where he was buried under a mound.<br />

He assisted to quell the rising in Devonshire in 1549, and after his father had been created Earl of Bedford in January 1550, was known as Lord Russell, taking his seat in the House of Lords under this title in 1552.<br />
 <br />
Russell was in sympathy with the reformers, whose opinions he shared, and was in communication with Sir Thomas Wyatt; and in consequence of his religious attitude was imprisoned during the earlier part of Mary's reign. Being released he visited Italy, came into touch with foreign reformers. He led the English contingent fighting for Philip II of Spain, then Englands King Consort, at the Battle of St. Quentin in 1557.<br />
[edit] Elizabeth<br />
 <br />
When Elizabeth ascended the throne in November 1558 the Earl of Bedford, as Russell had been since 1555, became an active figure in public life. He was made a privy councillor, and was sent on diplomatic errands to Charles IX of France and Mary, Queen of Scots.<br />
 <br />
From February 1564 to October 1567 he was governor of Berwick and warden of the east marches of Scotland, in which capacity he conducted various negotiations between Elizabeth and Mary. He appears to have been an efficient warden, but was irritated by the vacillating and tortuous conduct of the English queen. When the northern insurrection broke out in 1569, Bedford was sent into Wales, and he sat in judgment upon the Duke of Norfolk in 1572.<br />
In 1576 he was president of the council of Wales, and in 1581 was one of the commissioners deputed to arrange a marriage between Elizabeth and François, Duke of Anjou. Bedford, who was made a Knight of the Garter in 1564, appears to have been a generous and popular man, and died in London. He was buried at the family chapel next to Chenies Manor House, the family estate which he had made his principal home and where he had entertained Queen Elizabeth in 1570.<br />
His first wife was Margaret St John (Bletsoe, Bedfordshire, 1533 - 27 August 1562), daughter of Sir John St John (great-grandson of Margaret Beauchamp of Bletso) and Margaret Walgrave, by whom he had four sons and three daughters:<br />
    * Anne Russell (1548-1603), married Ambrose Dudley, 3rd Earl of Warwick<br />
    * Edward Russell, Baron Russell (1551-1572), married Jane Sybilla Morrison of Cashiobury, without issue<br />
    * John Russell, Baron Russell (c.1553-1584), married Elizabeth Cooke, one daughter<br />
    * Francis Russell, Baron Russell (c.1554 - 27 July 1585), married Juliana Foster and had issue, including Edward Russell, 3rd Earl of Bedford, and Mary Ann Russell, wife of John Roote, and had issue<br />
    * William Russell, 1st Baron Russell of Thornhaugh (c.1557-1613)<br />
    * Elizabeth Russell (d. 1605), married William Bourchier, 3rd Earl of Bath<br />
    * Margaret Russell (1560-1616), married George Clifford, 3rd Earl of Cumberland.<br />
 <br />
His second wife was Bridget (d. 1601), daughter of John Hussey, 1st Baron Hussey of Sleaford, twice widowed. He was succeeded as third Earl by his grandson, Edward (1572-1627), only son of Francis, Lord Russell (c. 1550-1585).<br />

From Wikipedia<br />
 <br />
Olof Trätälja, Olaf Tree Feller (Old Norse: Ólafr trételgja, Swedish: Olof Trätälja, Norwegian: Olav Tretelgja) was the son of the Swedish king Ingjald Ill-ruler of the House of Yngling according to Heimskringla. His mother was Gauthild, a princess of West Götaland, whose maternal grandfather was Olof the Sharp-sighted, the king of Nerike.<br />
 <br />
His mother sent him to his foster-father Bove in West Götaland, where he grew up with his foster-brother Saxe who was surnamed Flette.<br />
 <br />
When Olof heard of his father's death, he assembled the men who were willing to follow him and went to his kinsmen in Nerike, because after his father's atrocities, the Swedes had grown hostile towards the Ynglings.<br />
 <br />
When the Swedes learnt that Olof and his kin had sought refuge in Nerike, they were were attacked and had to head west through deep and mountainous forests (Kilsbergen) to lake Vänern and the estuary of Klarälven (where Karlstad is presently situated). Here, they settled and cleared land. Soon they had created a whole province called Värmland, where they could make good living.<br />
 <br />
When the Swedes learnt that Olof was clearing land, they were amused and called him the Tree-feller. Olof married a woman named Solveig who was a daughter of Halfdan Guldtand of Soleyar. Olof and Solveigh had two sons, Ingjald Olofsson and Halfdan Hvitbeinn, who were brought up in Soleyar in the house of his mother's uncle Sölve.<br />
 <br />
Because of king Ivar Vidfamne and his harsh rule many Swedes emigrated to Värmland, and they became so numerous that the province could not sustain them. The land was afflicted by famine of which the Swedes accused the king. It was an old tradition in Sweden of holding the king responsible for the wealth of the land (see Domalde). The Swedes accused Olof of neglecting his sacrifices to the gods and believed that this was the cause of the famine.<br />
 <br />
The Swedish settlers thus rebelled against Olof, surrounded his house on the shores of lake Vänern and burnt him inside it. Thus he was sacrificed to Odin, like his ancestor Domalde.<br />
 <br />
However, Historia Norwegiae says that Olof succeeded his father and ruled as the king of Sweden in peace until his death.<br />
    diu et pacifice functus regno plenus dierum obiit in Swethia<br />
The lines of Ynglingatal appear to say that he was was a Swedish prince (sv́ıa jöfri), and that he was burnt inside his hall and disappeared from Gamla Uppsala<br />

Thomas Roote  (1555 - 1609)<br />
  Thomas Roote was born in, and lived in, a town called Badby, England, which was a parish in Northampton County. The Bishopric of London had Northampton County as his Diocese. The ancient name for Badby was Baddebi, which could have been derived from the Saxon words bade (a pledge in security) and bye (a dwelling or habitation). In the 1600 time frame, Badby was about 2.5 miles from Daventry. The village stood on the side of a sandy ascent called Badby - Down, and there were numerous springs of water and quarries of hard blue rag stones. It is a rural landscape, including Ardbury Hill, which includes about 10 acres of entrenchments reportedly built by the Romans. The village consisted of 86 houses and three inns. The three inns were named "Court House," "Burchill House," and "Root House." Thomas Roote married Elizabeth Parker, who bore him one child, John. Thomas died in 1609 and is buried in a churchyard in Badby. John Roote was raised by an uncle who adopted him. This uncle was a man of wealth, advanced in years, a zealous opponent of Popery, and considered one of the nobility.<br />

Eystein Halfdansson (Old Norse: Eysteinn Hálfdansson) was the son ofHalfdan Hvitbeinn of the House of Yngling according to Heimskringla. Helived around 730, and inherited the throne of Romerike and Vestfold.<br />
 <br />
His wife was Hild, the daughter of the king of Vestfold, Erik Agnarsson. Erik had no son so Eystein inherited Vestfold.<br />
 <br />
Eystein went to Varna with some ships to pillage and carried away all livestock and other valuables. However, the king of Varna was king Skjöld who was a great warlock. Skjöld arrived at the beach and saw the sails of Eystein's ships. He waved his cloak and blew into it which caused a boom of one ship to swing and hit Eystein so that he fell overboard and drowned. His body was salvaged and buried in a mound.<br />
 <br />
Eystein was inherited by his son Halfdan the Mild.<br />

From Wikipedia<br />
 <br />
Berengar of Friuli (? - 16 April 924) was a Margrave of Friuli, King of Italy (from 888 on) and Emperor of the Holy Roman Empire from 915 on.<br />
 <br />
Berengar I originated from the Carolingians on his mother's side. He was the son of Gisela, a daughter of Louis the Pious, and Eberhard, the Margrave of Friuli.<br />
 <br />
His older brother Unroch III died before his time and Berengar succeeded him as margrave of Friuli around 874. With this his obtained a key position, as the margrave bordered the Slavs and Magyars who where threatening the Italian peninsula. In 888, Berengar succeeded in convincing the Italian nobility to proclaim him King of Italy, even though there certainly were other options for the title. His rival, Guy of Spoleto, tried to outmaneuver him by having Pope Stephen VI crown him Emperor, as well as crowning both him and his son Lambert of Spoleto as King. The coronation was considered controversial because Guy was known to be an archrival of the Pope. Nevertheless, Guy succeeded in restoring order in Italy from his bases in Pavia and Rome. Fortunately for Berengar, Pope Formosus invited King Arnulf of the East Franks to Italy in 893 to overthrow Guy. Arnulf sent his illegitimate son Zwentibold, who met up with Berengar. Together, they cornered Guy at Pavia, but did not press their advantage (it is believe that Guy bribed them off). The following year, Arnulf and Berengar defeated Guy at Bergamo and took control of Pavia and Milan. Guy died in 894. His son, Emperor Lambert, defeated an attempt by Berengar to advance on Pavia in 898, but died in a hunting accident days later. Meanwhile, Arnulf, who had been crowned in 896 in opposition to Lambert, had left Italy that same year. It seemed that Berengar would quickly regain his authority.<br />
 <br />
Outside events would change this, however. Chaos had struck as the first Magyar invasions had commenced and Berengar's defeat at their hands near the Brenta river in 899 caused the nobility to question his ability to protect Italy. As a result, they supported another candidate for the throne, Louis of Provence. In 900 Louis marched into Italy and defeated Berengar; the following year he was crowned King and Emperor by Pope Benedict IV. In 902, however, Berengar struck back and defeated Louis, making him promise not to return to Italy. When he broke this oath by invading the peninsula again in 905, Berengar again defeated him at Verona, captured him, and ordered him to be blinded. Louis returned to Lower Burgundy and ruled for another twenty years as Louis the Blind. Berengar thereby cemented his position as king.<br />
 <br />
In January 915, Pope John X, after forging an alliance between Berengar and the local Italian rulers, crowned Berengar as Emperor, hoping he could face the Saracen threat in the south of Italy. However, Berengar returned swiftly to the north where Friuli was still threatened by the Magyars. Dissatisfied with the emperor, several Italian nobles invited Rudolf II of Upper Burgundy to take the Italian throne in 922. Moreover, his own son-in-law, the Margrave of Ivrea, rose up against him, incited by Rudolf. Berengar retreated to Verona and had to watch sidelined as the Magyars pillaged the country. Pavia was sacked in 924, and the same year Berengar was murdered by one of his own men, possibly at the instigation of Rudolf.<br />
 <br />
There exists an anonymous writing, 'Gesta Berengarii Imperatoris', about the many happenings of his troublesome time.<br />

The Teacher on Altappen.<br />
Teacher Lydia Sundstöm was a sister of farmer and writer Nils Fredrik Sundström in Hertsön and the daughter of legendary Nils Petter Sundström (Captain Balaklava) from Luleå and Hertsön.<br />
Lydia was born in 1865. She received her teacher's education in Gammelstad and passed her teacher's exam in 1883. At that time a teacher's education alternated between Öjebyn and Gammelstad. Every second year the education took place in Öjebyn and then Gammelstad.<br />
She was employed as a teacher on the island Altappen, situated at the mouth of the Lule river, probably the year after her exam. In 1891 she took a years leave of absence and traveled by boat to Stockholm to continue her eduction at a school of household management.<br />
Her well wrtten letters to her relatives in Luleå during her stay in Stockholm are still kept by her relatives. In her letters she describes, in a lyrical way and with feeling and exactness, her stay at the school and all the things she learned there.<br />
The next year she returned to duty as a teacher on Altappen and taught school there until 1908 when a disastrous fire devastated the island. All the industrial buildings and the homes were totally destroyed. The only buildings that were saved were the school and builder's villa (Managing Directors residence). 500 persons lost their jobs, their homes and their belongings.<br />
After the fire, Lydia moved to Luleå and set up a home in Kungsgatan 26. (Kings street #26). and taught school at Östra Skolan (East school) until 1925. She died in 1947.<br />
From Luleå newspaper NSD in Sweden 16 April 2008. It was translated by Gunilla Sundstrom.<br />
 <br />
The original article in Swedish:<br />
 <br />
Lärarinnan på Altappen<br />
Lärarinnan Lydia Sundström var syster till jordbrukaren och skribenten Nils Fredrik Sundström i Hertsön och således dotter till legendariska sjökaptenen Nils Petter Sundström (Kapten Balaklava) från Luleå och Hertsön.<br />
Lydia föddes 1865. Hon fick sin lärarutbildning i Gammelstad där hon tog sin lärarexamen 1883. Vid den tiden fanns en ambulerande lärarutbildning mellan Öjebyn och Gammelstad. Vartannat år i Öjebyn och vartannat i Gammelstad.<br />
Hon anställdes som lärare på ön Altappen i Luleåälvens mynning, troligen året efter examen. 1891 tog hon tjänstledigt och reste med båt till Stockholm för att vidareutbilda sig under ett år på en hushållsskola.<br />
Hennes välformulerade brev hem till anhöriga i Luleå under Stockholmsvistelsen finns bevarade i släkten. I breven berättar hon lyriskt med inlevelse och noggrannhet om sin vistelse på skolan och allt hon fick lära sig där.<br />
Året därpå återvände hon till sin tjänst på Altappen och arbetade där fram till 1908 då en förödande brand ödelade ön. Alla industribyggnader och bostadshus jämnades med marken sånär som på skolan och byggmästarvillan och 500 människor blev arbetslösa och utblottade på husrum och ägodelar.<br />
Efter branden bosatte sig Lydia på Kungsgatan 26 i Luleå och tjänstgjorde på Östra skolan fram till 1925. Hon avled 1947.<br />

Comments made by Gunilla regarding above article.<br />
 <br />
Altappen is a small island close to Luleå. A large saw mill on the island employed quite a lot of people. The school was managed by the saw mill company. The saw mill caught fire on July 3, 1908 and the whole island was left in ruins.<br />
"Captain Balaklava", N.P. Sundström, sea captain from Luleå was given the name of honor "Captain Balaklava" when, during the Crimean War, he was able to, on his own ship, import cargo into the Black Sea.<br />
Öjebyn was the old city Piteå, 50 kilometers south of Luleå. Öjebyn has, like Gammelstad, an old church and some church cottages.<br />
Östra skolan is a huge school building inLuleå, built in 1901, and still in use. My mother went to school there in 1919.<br />

Dorothy A. Kilgore loved to play the piano and organ. For 50 years sheshared her talent and emotive playing with the congregations of churchesin Wenatchee and Seattle.<br />
Mrs. Kilgore, who continued to play on special occasions at Elim Baptist Church in Wallingford until she was well into her 80s, died in her sleep of an apparent stroke on Good Friday (April 10).<br />
She was 92.<br />
Her listeners felt a spiritual uplifting through her music because she played it with such conviction, said Mrs. Kilgore's daughter, Carmen Nylund of Mukilteo.<br />
"Dorothy was a delightful lady. She was a friend to a lot of people," said Norman McLean, pastor of Bear Creek Community Church in Woodinville, who was pastor at Elim Baptist Church for many of the years Mrs. Kilgore was organist there. "She's one of the special people I'll always remember."<br />
Born in Wenatchee, where her parents were among the area's early apple growers, Mrs. Kilgore played organ for the silent movies at the Liberty and Rialto theaters, as well as at the Wenatchee First Baptist Church. She and her husband, Floyd, moved to Seattle in 1942 when he took a job in the wartime shipyards.<br />
After World War II, the Kilgores operated a variety store at Northwest 75th Street and 15th Avenue Northwest in Ballard. It was known as Kilgore's Corner. Mrs. Kilgore worked there until the family closed the store in 1956.<br />
At home, Mrs. Kilgore always had a piano or an organ, sometimes both, her daughter said.<br />
Mrs. Kilgore worked for Western Farmers Association on Elliott Avenue until she retired in 1970.<br />
Mrs. Kilgore remained active in her church women's group and in the Salvation Army center in the Greenwood neighborhood near where she lived until her death. She took part in Bible study there and embroidered towels for sale at the group's fund-raising bazaar.<br />
Mrs. Kilgore's husband of 45 years preceded her in death, as did her son, Walt.<br />
Besides daughter Carmen, she is survived by son-in-law Bruce Nylund ; daughter and son-in-law Shirley and Wally Olson, Cook, Minn.; daughter-in-law Elaine Kilgore, Issaquah; sister Bonita Carpenter; nine grandchildren; and 15 great-grandchildren.<br />

Henry and Eleanor had two children: Margaret (Barr) & Patricia (Jacobs).<br />
Although Henry's tombstone indicates he was born in 1919, that is not correct. There was a large chart with her children's names & dates of birth that hung on the wall at Henry's mother's home. That chart shows that Henry was born 22 Oct 1922. Additionally, he was not on the 1920 census and was enumerated as age 7 on the 1930 census. Thus, he was born in 1922, not 1919.<br />

Lothair (825 - August 8, 869), was the second son of the emperor LothairI. On his father's death in 855, he received for his kingdom a districtlying west of the Rhine, between the North Sea and the Jura mountains,which was called Regnum Lotharii and early in the 10th century becameknown as Lotharingia or Lorraine (the later duchy of Lorraine). His elderbrother Louis II received Italy and the title of Emperor, and his youngerbrother Charles received Burgundy and the Provence.<br />
 <br />
On the death of his brother Charles in 863 Lothair added some lands south of the Jura to this inheritance, but, except for a few feeble expeditions against the Danish pirates, he seems to have done little for its government or its defence.<br />
 <br />
The reign was chiefly occupied by efforts on the part of Lothair to obtain a divorce from his wife Teutberga, a sister of Hucbert, abbot of St Maurice (d. 864); and his relations with his uncles Charles the Bald and Louis the German, were influenced by his desire to obtain their support to this plan. Although quarrels and reconciliations between the three kings followed each other in quick succession, in general it may be said that Louis favoured the divorce, and Charles opposed it, while neither lost sight of the fact that Lothair had no sons to inherit his lands. Lothair, whose desire for the divorce was prompted by his affection for a certain Waldrada, put away Teutberga; but Hucbert took up arms on her behalf, and after she had submitted successfully to the ordeal of water, Lothair was compelled to restore her in 858. Still pursuing his purpose, he won the support of his brother, the emperor Louis II, by a cession of lands, and obtained the consent of the local clergy to the divorce and to his marriage with Waldrada, which took place in 862.<br />
 <br />
A synod of Frankish bishops met at Metz in 863 and confirmed this decision, but Teutberga fled to the court of Charles the Bald, and Pope Nicholas I declared against the decision of the synod. An attack on Rome by the emperor was without result, and in 865 Lothair, convinced that Louis and Charles at their recent meeting had discussed the partition of his kingdom, and threatened with excommunication, again took back his wife. Teutberga, however, either from inclination or compulsion, now expressed her desire for a divorce, and Lothair went to Italy to obtain the assent of the new Pope Adrian II. Placing a favourable interpretation upon the words of the pope, he had set out on the return journey, when he was seized with fever and died at Piacenza on the August 8, 869. He left, by Waldrada, a son Hugo who was declared illegitimate, and his kingdom was divided between his uncles Charles the Bald and Louis the German by the Treaty of Mersen.<br />

From Wikipedia<br />
 <br />
In Scandinavian legendary tradition Yrsa is the illegitimate daughter of Helgi whom Helgi later unwittingly married and on whom he fathered his famous son Hrólf Kraki. Yrsa left Helgi on learning the truth and became the wife of King Adils of Sweden (or she returned to her former husband Adils in one account).<br />
 <br />
Not all variations between accounts are covered below.<br />
 <br />
Yrsa was an illegimate daughter of Helgi son of Halfdan whom Helgi fathered by force on a foreign queen. The girl was brought up without knowing who her father was. According to the Gesta Danorum (Book 2) and the Saga of Hrólf Kraki, Helgi came upon Yrsa in one of his raiding expeditions and carried her off and made her his wife. Then, after she had born Hrólf to Helgi, Yrsa's mother made Yrsa's parentage openly known. Yrsa fled from her husband who was also her father and eventually married King Adils (Eadgils), the nephew of Áli (Onela). But according to the lost Skjöldunga saga and the Ynglinga saga Yrsa was first captured in Saxony by Adils who made her his wife, then captured from Adils by Helgi in a raid who in turn made her his wife, and then when Yrsa's mother revealed that Yrsa's father was her husband Helgi, Yrsa returned to Adils.<br />
 <br />
Not long after Hrólf had become king, Adils requested his assistance in battle against his own uncle Áli. Hrólf sent his twelve champions, led by Bödvar Bjarki. Áli was defeated and Adils gained the kingdom.<br />
 <br />
But when Adils refuses to give Hrólf's men the tribute they demand, Hrólf Kraki sets off to Uppsala. After Hrólf had avoided Adils plots and Adils was gone gathering reinforcements, Yrsa met with Hrólf and gave him a silver horn filled with gold and jewels and a famous ring called Sviagris. Hrólf was also joined by one of Yrsa's servants, a young man named Vögg (the Wiglaf of Beowulf?) who gave him the nickname Kraki. With the treasure given them by Yrsa, Hrólf and his men try to escape over Fýrisvellir (the Fyris Wolds). As Hrólf was fleeing in desperation he spilled out the gold to occupy the pursuers with treasure collecting instead. King Adils, however, overtook Hrólf who desperately threw away Sviagris. When Adils stooped to pick it up with his spear Hrólf ungloriously cut him in the back screaming that he had bent the back of the most powerful man in Sweden, stole the ring once again and fled .<br />
 <br />
Saxo claims that it was Yrsa who enticed Hrólf to come to Adils' court, as she was tired of Adils' stinginess and she plotted to have Hrólf take her away and to take Adils' wealth with her. In this account Yrsa does flee with Hrólf along with wagons filled with treasure and it is by her council that the treasure is then flung away. Saxo also declares that some say that Yrsa had forseen that this stratagem might be necessary and had prepared for it, so that what was tossed was only copper gilt over with gold while she and her son escaped with the true wealth.<br />
 <br />
The name Yrsa appears in the form Yrse or Yrs in some editions and translations of the Old English poem Beowulf through conjectural emendation of a defective line. By this emendation Yrsa appears as the daughter of Healfdene who married a Heatho-Scylfing whose name ends in -ela and is therefore taken to be Onela.<br />

"Surnamed "William with the strong hand," from the followingcircumstance, as related by William Dugdale: "It happened that the Queenof France [ADELAIDE OF SAVOY (RIN 1532)], being then a widow, and a verybeautiful woman, became much in love with a knight from another country,who was a homely person, and in the flower of his youth; and because shethought that no man excelled him in valor, she caused a tournament to beproclaimed throughout her dominions, promising to reward those who shouldexercise themselves therein, according to their respective abilities; andconcluded that if the person whom she so well affected should act hispart better than others in those military exercises, she might marry himwithout any dishonor to herself. Whereupon divers gallant men, fromforeign parts hasting to Paris, amongst others came this our William deAlbini, ravely accoutered, and in the tournament excelled all others,overcoming many, and wounding one mortally with his lance, which beingobserved by the queen, she became exceedingly enamored of him, andforthwith invited him to a costly banquet, and afterwards bestowingcertain jewels upon him, offered him marriage; but, having plighted histroth to the Queen of England, a widow, he refused her, whereat she grewso discontented that she consulted with her maids how she might take awayhis life; and in pursuance of that design, enticed him into a garden -which she descended by divers steps, under color of showing him thebeast; and when she told him of its fierceness, he answered, that it wasa womanish and not a manly quality to be afraid thereof. But having himthere, by the advantage of a folding door, thrust him to the lion; beingtherefore in this danger, he rolled his mantle about his arm, and puttinghis hand into the mouth of the beast, pulled out his tongue by the root;which done, he followed the queen to her palace, and gave it to one ofher maids to present her. Returning thereupon to England, with the fameof this glorious exploit, he was forthwith advanced to the Earldom ofArundel, and for his arms the Lion given him." He subsequently marriedAdeliza of Lorraine, Queen of England, widow of King Henry I., and thedaughter of Godfrey, Duke of Lorraine. Adeliza had the castle of Arundelin dowry from her deceased husband, the monarch, and thus her new lordbecame its feudal earl, 1st Earl of Arundel in this family. The earl wasone of those who solicited the Empress Maud to come to England, andreceived her and her brother Robert, Earl of Gloucester, at the port ofArundel, in August 1139, and in three years afterwards (1142), in thereport made of King Stephen's taking William de Mandeville at St. Albans,it is stated "that before he could be laid hold on, he underwent a sharpskirmish with the king's party, wherein the Earl of Arundel, though astout and expert soldier, was unhorsed in the midst of the water byWalceline de Oxeai, and almost drowned." In 1150, he wrote himself Earlof Chichester, but we find him styled again Earl of Arundel, upon a verymemorable occasion, namely, the reconciliation of Henry, Duke ofNormandy, afterwards King Henry II (RIN 761)., and King Stephen at thesiege of Wallingford Castle in 1152. "It was scarce possible," saysRapin, "for the armies to part without fighting. Accordingly the twoleaders were preparing for battle with equal ardor, when, by the prudentadvice of the Earl of Arundel, who was on the king's side, they wereprevented from coming to blows." A truce and peace followed thisinterference of the earl's, which led to the subsequent accession ofHenry after Stephen's decease, in whose favor the earl stood so high thathe not only obtained for himself and his heirs the castle and honor ofArundel, but a confirmation of the Earldom of Sussex, of which county hewas really earl, by a grant of the Tertium Denarium of the pleas of theshire. In 1164, we find the Earl of Arundel deputed with Gilbert Foliot,Bishop of London, to remonstrate with Louis VII, King of France (RIN1530), upon according an asylum to Thomas a Becket within his dominions,and on the failure of that mission, dispatched with the archbishop ofYork, the Bishops of Winchester, London, Chichester, and Exeter, WidoRufus, Richard de Invecestre, John de Oxford (priests), Hugh deGundevile, Bernard de St. Valery, and Henry Fitzgerald, to lay the wholeaffair of Becket at the foot of the pontifical throne. Upon levying theaid for the marriage of the king's daughter, in the 12th year of HenryII., the knight's fees of the honor of Arundel were certified to beninety-seven, and those in Norfolk, belonging to the earl, forty-two. In1173, we find the Earl of Arundel commanding, in conjunction withWilliam, Earl of Mandeville, the king's army in Normandy, and compellingthe French monarch to abandon Verneuil after a long siege, and in thenext year, with Richard de Lucy, Justice of England, defeating Robert,Earl of Leicester (RIN 861), then in rebellion at St. Edmundbury. Thispotent nobleman, after founding and endowing several religious houses,died at Waverley, in Surrey, on October 3, 1176, and was buried in theAbbey of Wymondham. Buried in Wymondham Priory, NOR, England; Earl ofArundel, Earl of Lincoln. With his marriage to Adela, widow of Henry I,acquired Arundel Castle as part of her dowry. His possession of thecastle and honor of Arundel was confirmed by Henry II in 1154."<br />

Eadgils was a 6th century king of Sweden who appears in the Old Englishepic Beowulf.<br />
 <br />
In the Norse sagas and Gesta Danorum appears a Swedish 6th century king having a closely similar name Adils, or Athisl. This king was also the son of a king named Ohthere and just like in Beowulf, Adils killed a king named Onela (Ali) with foreign assistance.<br />
 <br />
In the Hrólf Kraki tradition, Adils (Eadgils) captured and married Yrsa (Yrs), the mother of Hrólf Kraki (Hrothulf). Not long after Hrólf became king, Eadgils requested his assistance against his uncle Áli (Onela). Hrólf sent his twelve companions, led by Bödvar Bjarki (who it is often remarked has similarities with Beowulf), Áli was defeated in the Battle on the Ice and Adils gained the kingdom. But when Adils refused to pay Hrólf's men the expected tributes for their help, Hrólf Kraki set off to Gamla Uppsala. As Adils was away, gathering reinforcements, Hrólf's mother and sister Yrsa then gave him a horn filled with gold and jewels and a famous ring called Sviagris 'Pig of the Swedes'. With the treasure given them by Yrsa, Hrólf and his men try to escape over the Fyrisvellir (Fyris Wolds). When Adils and his men pursued them, Hrólf desperately spilled out the gold to occupy the pursuers with treasure collecting instead. Adils, however, overtook Hrólf who desperately threw away Sviagris. When Adils stooped to pick it up with his spear Hrólf ungloriously cut him in the back screaming that he had bent the back of the most powerful man in Sweden, stole the ring once again and fled.<br />
 <br />
Snorri Sturluson relates that Adils loved good horses and had the best horses in his days (interestingly, the contempary Gothic scholar Jordanes noted that the Swedes were famed for their good horses). One horse was named Slöngve and another one Raven, which he had taken from Áli. From this horse he had bred a horse also named Raven which he sent to king Godgest of Hålogaland, but Godgest could not manage it and fell from it and died, in Omd on the island of Andøya. Adils himself died in a similar way at the Disablót. Adils was riding around the Disa shrine when Raven stumbled and fell, and the king was thrown forward and hit his skull on a stone. He was buried at Uppsala, and was succeeded by Östen.<br />
    Witch-demons, I have heard men say,<br />
    Have taken Adils' life away.<br />
    The son of kings of Frey's great race,<br />
    First in the fray, the fight, the chase,<br />
    Fell from his steed -- his clotted brains<br />
    Lie mixed with mire on Upsal's plains.<br />
    Such death (grim Fate has willed it so)<br />
    Has struck down Ole's [Onela's] deadly foe. (Laing's translation [1])<br />

Östen or Eystein (d. ca 600) was the son of Adils (Eadgils) and Yrsa ofSaxony. He was the father of Ingvar.<br />
 <br />
Snorri Sturluson relates that Östen ruled Sweden at the time when Hrólf Kraki died in Lejre. It was a troubled time when many seakings ravaged the Swedish shores. One of those kings was named Sölve and he was from Jutland (but according to Historia Norwegiae he was Geatish). At this time Sölve was pillaging in the Baltic Sea and so he arrived in Lofond (probably the island of Lovön or the Lagunda Hundred), where Östen was at a feast. It was night-time and Sölve and his men surrounded the house and set it on fire burning everyone inside to death. Then Sölve arrived at Sigtuna (Old Sigtuna) and ordered the Swedes to accept him as king. The Swedes refused and gathered an army that fought against Sölve and his men, but they lost after eleven days. The Swedes had to accept him as king for a while until they rebelled and killed him.<br />
    For a long time none could tell<br />
    How Eystein died -- but now I know<br />
    That at Lofond the hero fell;<br />

 <br />
Thorsteins saga V́ıkingssonar makes Östen the father of Anund and grand-father of Ingjald and consequently skips Ingvar's generation. It adds a second son to Östen named Olaf, who was the king of Fjordane in Norway.<br />

Gautrek it seems was mentioned in many tales, according to a passage nearthe end, for generosity and bravery but not for deep thinking. It isprobable there were many more amusing ancecdotes to that effect that theauthor planned to include.<br />
 <br />
The tale begins with one explanation of Gautrek's strangeness, relating how Gautrek's father-to-be, King Gauti of West Götaland, became lost while hunting and spent the night in a isolated homestead of strange, arguably insane, backwoods bumpkins: a stingy farmer named Skafnörtung 'Skinflint', his equally stingy wife Tötra 'Tatters', and their three sons and three daughters. That night Gauti fathered fathered Gautrek on Snotra who was the eldest of the farmer's daughters and supposedly the most intelligent of the bunch. The account bristles with grisly humor as it relates how one by one the members of this family of boobies committed suicide over the most trivial losses until at last only Snotra and her child survived. At that point Snotri took the child Gautrek to Gauti's court and King Gauti, years later on his deathbed, made Gautrek his heir.<br />
 <br />
Then, in a very different style, the story jumps to an account of the ancestry, birth, and earliest exploits of Starkad who is perhaps the grimest and strangest of Scandinavian legendary heroes. This account was probably extracted or retold from a lost saga about Starkad and included only because King Vikar, who appears prominently in it, is father of Jarl Neri who plays a very important role in the material following and also because Eiŕık king of Sweden who appears in it was prominent in Hrólfs saga Gautrekssonar. A high point of this section is the evocative episode where Starkad's foster-father Grani Horsehair awakened his foster-son Starkad at about midnight, took him to an island where eleven men were at council, and sitting in a twelfth chair revealed himself as the god Odin. A long dialogue occurred between the gods Thor and Odin in which Thor and Odin alternately bestowed different curses and blessings upon Starkad.<br />
 <br />
The tale then tells of Gautrek's marriage to Alfhild daughter of King Harald of Wendland and Alfhild's subsequent death by illness years later for which reason the grieving Gauthrek went somewhat out of his mind, ignored all matters of state, and spent all his time on Alfhild's burial mound, flying his hawk.<br />
 <br />
The final section is an account of folk tale kind relating how Ref, the lazy son of a farmer, forced his father's stupendous ox as gift upon the stingy but extraorindarily intelligent Jarl Neri and requested only Neri's advice in return. Jarl Neri normally never accepted gifts because he was too stingy to repay them. But he took the ox and gave Ref a whetstone in return, telling him how to employ it as a gift to King Gautrek to get greater wealth. On Neri's advice, Ref visted king after king, in each case giving part or all of that which he received from the previous king and getting in return a greater gift. At last, through Neri's advice and trickery, Ref gained the hand of Gautrek's daughter Helga and an earldom that Neri held from King Gautrek.<br />

Woolen mill survives lack of sheep, test of time by Tim King, The LandCorrespondent, 22 October 2004<br />
 <br />
The Indian uprising of the 1860s, the onslaught of inexpensive synthetic fibers and the devastating tornado of 1998 all have failed to stop the Saint Peter Woolen Mill from nearly 140 consecutive years of service to shepherds and the general public.<br />
 <br />
Throughout those 14 decades, the mill has always delivered custom wool washing and carding services to area shepherds. The Saint Peter Woolen Mill's history makes it the oldest custom wool-processing company in Minnesota.<br />
 <br />
In addition to custom processing, the Saint Peter Woolen Mill has a line of woolen comforters, mattress pads and pillows. These bedding products, marketed under the Nature's Comfort label, are sold wholesale to more than 30 stores and via the company's Web site and retail store in Saint Peter. For shepherds looking to add value to their wool, the Saint Peter Woolen Mill can turn wool into a similar line of products for shepherds to market individually.<br />
 <br />
"We even will make a customized label for you to put on your mattress pad or comforter," said Patricia Johnson who, with Peggy Grey, currently owns and manages the mill.<br />
 <br />
The woolen mill actually began business in the village of Traverse in the 1850s, under the ownership of Ed Borneman. When Saint Peter won the contest to be the county seat for Nicollet County a decade later, Borneman (and most everybody else in Traverse) pulled up stakes and moved to Saint Peter.<br />
 <br />
"The sheep industry was thriving at the time," Johnson said. "Every other person had sheep in their back yard, and there was a wool mill every 30 miles."<br />
 <br />
The industry was still thriving when Pat's great grandfather John Charles Brinker and his wife, Margaret, purchased the mill from Borneman in 1912.<br />
 <br />
Wool fiber for bedding and clothing remained a vital part of the economy until synthetic fibers became popular in the 1950s and 1960s. The result of the synthetic fiber boom was that sheep largely disappeared from the farm yard and woolen mills disappeared from small towns. Today there are no more than a handful spread across the nation. The Saint Peter Woolen Mill is one of them.<br />
 <br />
The mill has survived because the four generations of the Brinker family that have managed it have pursued a flexible business strategy while maintaining their traditional services. Wool purchasing is one of the areas the current management team has been flexible about.<br />
 <br />
"We used to buy the wool for our wholesale products locally but then we could not get enough," Johnson said. "Now we buy from a wool cooperative, and they sort and grade it to our specifications."<br />
 <br />
Even though there are no longer enough sheep in south central Minnesota to support the Saint Peter Woolen Mills buying needs, the mill continues to provide one of the services it provided back in great grandfather Brinker's time when most families had a few sheep. The mill will restore your family comforter to its original fluffy state.<br />
 <br />
"We can recard the wool to make it fluffy again and, if necessary, add new wool," Johnson said. "We have a line of fabrics so we can also help you choose a new cover if you want."<br />
 <br />
Whether she's talking about traditional services such as restoring family comforters and custom wool processing or talking about the Saint Peter Woolen Mill's line of fine bedding products, Johnson is an outspoken advocate of wool's value. She said that today's customers have to be re-educated when it comes to wool's superiority over synthetic fibers.<br />
 <br />
"Wool is warmer in winter and cooler in summer than polyester," she said.<br />
 <br />
Most everybody knows about wool's warmth for winter wear, but wool is not normally seen as something to wear to keep cool in the summer.<br />
 <br />
"It wicks off the moisture from your body while polyester, which is essentially plastic, traps it," Johnson said.<br />
 <br />
She also said most of what you think you know about washing wool is simply myth, not fact. To wash wool you need to take only one precaution. You need to wash it gently by hand. You can wash it in any soap and in the hottest water you want. That won't harm your wool sweater. But if you wash it in a washing machine with an agitator or even handle it roughly during dry cleaning, it will shrink.<br />
 <br />
Well, that's another myth too. Wool doesn't actually shrink. It gets matted. Felt is the correct term, according to Johnson.<br />
 <br />
"Wool fibers have little barbs and so does human hair," she said. "You can wash hair in hot water with strong soaps and it doesn't shrink. But if you have long hair and rub it together, it becomes matted. That's what happens to wool when you wash it too vigorously. That's what shrinking is."<br />
 <br />
When wool is treated properly, the barbs are an asset. Because of the tiny barbs, Johnson said, wool is better in a comforter than even down. Down, she said, doesn't have barbs to hold it together. As a result down settles to the corners of a comforter while wool holds together and stays put.<br />
