Berthe of the FRANKS
<p>
<a name ="I015321"><b>[I015321]</b></a><br />
Berthe, Princess of Paris, also Bertha, Queen of Kent, (539-c.612) was one of Charibert's daughters. In marrying the pagan King Ethelbert of Kent, she brought her chaplain Liudhard with her, and restored a Christian church in Canterbury, which dated form the Roman occupation, dedicating it to St. Martin. The present St. Martin's at Canterbury occupies the same site. Saint Augustine, who was sent by Gregory the Great to preach the Gospel in England in 596, owed much of his favourable reception there to the influence of Berthe.<br>
She seems to have had two children:<br>
    * Eadbald of Kent<br>
    * Ethelberg of Kent<br>

Carloman I of the FRANKS
<p>
<a name ="I010273"><b>[I010273]</b></a><br />
From Wikipedia<br>
<br>
Carloman (716-754) was the son of Charles Martel, major domo or Mayor of the Palace of Austrasia and Chrotrud. He was a member of the family later called the Carolingians and it can be argued that he was instrumental in consolidating their power at the expense of the ruling Merovingian kings of the Franks.<br>
<br>
After the death of his father in 741, power was initially divided among Carloman and his brothers Pippin III and Grifo. By 742, Carloman and Pippin had ousted Grifo, and each turned his attention towards his own area of influence as major domo, Pippin in the West and Carloman in the East.<br>
<br>
Carloman strengthened his authority in part via his support of the Anglo-Saxon missionary Winfrid (Boniface), the so-called "Apostle of the Germans", whom he charged with restructuring the chuch in the Frankish Empire. This was in part a continuation of a policy begun under his grandfather Pippin of Herstal and continued to a lesser extent under Charles Martel. Carloman was instrumental in convening the Concilium Germanicum in 742, the first major Church synod to be held in the eastern parts of the Frankish kingdom. Chaired jointly by him and Boniface, the synod ruled that priests were not allowed to bear arms or to host females in their houses and that it was one of the primary tasks to eradicate pagan beliefs. While his father had frequently confiscated church property to reward his followers, Carloman sought to increase the assets of the church. He donated, for instance, the land for one of Boniface's most important foundation, the monastery of Fulda.<br>
<br>
Carloman could be ruthless towards real or perceived opponents. In 746, he convened an assembly of all alamanni dukes and nobles at Cannstatt and then had most of them, numbering in the thousands, arrested and executed for high treason in the bloody judgment of Cannstatt. This eradicated virtually the entire tribal leadership of the Alamanni and ended the independence of the tribal duchy of Alamannia which was thereafter governed by counts appointed by their Frankish overlords.<br>
<br>
These actions strengthened Carloman's position, and that of the family as a whole, especially in terms of their rivalries with other leading families such as the Bavarian Agilofings.<br>
<br>
In 747, Carloman renounced his position as major domo and withdrew to a monastic life in Monte Soracte und Monte Cassino. He died on 17 July 754 and was buried in Monte Cassino.<br>

Charibert I of the FRANKS
<p>
<a name ="I015322"><b>[I015322]</b></a><br />
From Wikipedia<br>
<br>
Charibert (c.517 - November or December 567), king of the Franks, was the second eldest son of Clotaire I and Ingonde. (Their eldest son was Gunthar, who died sometime before his father's death.)<br>
<br>
On Clotaire's death in 561, his estates were divided among his sons in a new configuration, Charibert receiving the kingdom between the Somme and the Loire, with Paris as his capital, together with Rouen and Tours, with the Aquitaine and Novempopulana to its south, with the cities of Poitiers, Limoges, Bordeaux, and Toulouse, Cahors and Albi.<br>
<br>
Though the election of bishops in Merovingian territories was subject to manipulation and veto by the king, once consecrated, the bishops were in control within the cities, though perhaps not all as firmly as at Tours, where bishop Gregory, invoking the wrath of Saint Martin, was able to extract a coronation promise on oath from Charibert:<br>
<br>
    "that he would not burden the people with new laws and customs, but he would retain only those under which they had previously lived in the time of his father; and he promised that he would not impose upon them any new ordinance which would result in loss to them." - Gregory of Tours.<br>
<br>
Thus hampered in raising funds (largely as gifts in kind anyway) and under such obligations not to create innovative policy or law, the Merovingian kings' sphere of operations was severely limited.<br>
<br>
Besides his wife, Ingoberga, with whom he had a daughter, Berthe, or Aldeberge, (539-ca 612), he had unions with Merofleda, a wool-carder's daughter and her sister (precipitating his ban of excommunication, the first ever levelled at a Merovingian king), and Theodogilda, the daughter of a neatherd (cowherd). Charibert was scarcely more than "king at Paris" when he married his daughter Berthe to Aethelbert, the pagan king of Kent, who probably came to his throne in A.D. 560. She took with her,Bishop Liudhard, as her private confessor. According to Bede, Aethelbert's supremacy in 597 stretched over all the petty English kingdoms as far as the Humber; whether this is an exaggeration or not, it was at any rate sufficient to guarantee the safety of Augustine when in 597 the mission of Augustine landed in Thanet. The Christian mission was received at first with some hesitation by the king, who gave Augustine a dwelling-place in Canterbury, and the Christian conversion, first of Kent, then of other Anglo-Saxons proceeded from there, thanks to Charibert's daughter.<br>
<br>
Though Charibert was eloquent and learned in the law, he was one of the most dissolute of the Merovingian kings, his early death in 567, under a ban of excommunication, being brought on by his excesses. He was buried at the abbey of Saint-Vincent (later Saint-Germain-des-Pres, then outside Paris. At his death his brothers Guntram, Sigebert I, and Chilperic I shared his realm, agreeing at first to hold Paris in common. His surviving queen (out of four), Theudechild, proposed a marriage with Guntram, though a council held at Paris as recently as 557 had outlawed such tradition as incestuous. Guntram decided to house her more safely, though unwillingly, in a nunnery at Arles.<br>

Charles Martel of the FRANKS
<p>
<a name ="I004768"><b>[I004768]</b></a><br />
He was victor over the Saracens at Tours, Poitiers, in 732.<br>
<br>
Carolingian ruler of the Frankish kingdom of Austrasia (in present northeastern France and southwestern Germany). Charles, whose surname means the hammer, was the son of Pepin of Herstal and the grandfather of Charlemagne. Pepin was mayor of the palace under the last kings of the Merovingian dynasty. When he died in 714, Charles, an illegitimate son, was imprisoned by his father's widow, but he escaped in 715 and was proclaimed mayor of the palace by the Austrasians. A war between Austrasia and the Frankish kingdom of Neustria (now part of France) followed, and at the end of it Charles became the undisputed ruler of all the Franks. Although he was engaged in wars against the Alamanni, Bavarians, and Saxons, his greatest achievements were against the Muslims from Spain, who invaded France in 732. Charles defeated them near Poitiers in a great battle in which the Muslim leader, Abd-ar-Rahman, the emir of Spain, was killed. The progress of Islam, which had filled all Christendom with alarm, was thus checked for a time. Charles drove the Muslims out of the Rhone valley in 739, when they had again advanced into France as far as Lyon, leaving them nothing of their possessions north of the Pyrenees beyond the Aude River. Charles died in Quierzy, on the Oise River, leaving the kingdom divided between his two sons, Carloman (circa 715-54) and Pepin the Short.<br>
<br>
SOURCES:<br>
Charles Martel (Andre Roux: Scrolls, 191.)<br>
<br>
<br>
Born: in 686 in Chateau de Franchemont, Belgium, son of Pepin II d'Heristal and Aupais=Alpaide N? , The Chateau de Franchemont is near Spa and also Verviers, which may have encompassed Heristal. During World War II, the resistance used the tunnels under the castle to hide people and supplies from the German hordes.<br>
<br>
Married before 715: Rotrude=Chrotrud, Duchesse d'Austrasie , daughter of Saint Lievin=Leutwinus, Bishop de Treves and N. d'Istrie. Note - between 715 and 741: Toward the end of 715, Charles escaped from the prison his step-grandmother had locked him in, and rallies the Austrasians. In March, 716, however, in his first conflict with the Frisons who were edging their way up the Rhine, Charles is routed. A few weeks later, he is able to beat the Neustrians on the Ambeve River, near Malmedy. on 21 March 717, he is victorious over the Neustrians again, this time at Vincy, near Cambrai and he forces Chilperic II and his Mayor of the Palace, Rainfroi to flee to Paris. In 714, Charles takes the title Mayor of the Palace of Neustria, and gives the Neustrians a new King, Clotaire IV, son of Thierry III [who had died in 691] . The same year, his armies ravage Saxe all the way to the Weser River. In early 719, Clotaire IV died, and Rainfroi and Chilperic II obtain the assistance of Eudes, Duke of Aquitaine in a campaign against Charles. Charles defeats both armies; however, since Clotaire IV is dead, Charles recognizes Chilperic, but he becomes the Major Domus of both Neustria and Austrasia. When Chilperic II died in 721, Charles pulled Thierry IV, young adolescent son of Dagobert III, out of the Monastery of Chelles. from 722 to 724, the arabs mount successful offensives and pillage Autun. Charles, worried about maintaining the Franc authority, Charles Martel mounts a frightfully succesful campaign in Bavaria against the Allemanians and the Frisons, and he destroys their temples. Theutbald, Duke of the Allemanians is essentially powerless. In Gaule, toward the end of the decade, Charles turns his attention to Eudes, Duke of Aquitaine, who had maintained too independent an attitude. Aquitaine is ravaged in the process. In 730, Eudes allies himself with an Emir of northern Spain, Othmann ben Abi-Nessa and the arabs agin a foothold in southern France. By 732, a new emir, Adb-el-Rahman invades from Pampelona, cross the Pyrenees near Roncevaux, take and pillage Bordeaux, burning all the churches. In the Summer, they take Poitiers and destroy the basilica of Saint-Hilaire-hors-les-murs. On Saturday 17 October 732, Charles Martel's armies take the great Roman way linking Chatellerault to Poitiers and at 20 km North of Poitiers, at Moussais-la-Bataille, it encounters the arabs. They would observe each other for 7 days before the Battle of Poitiers would take place.<br>
<br>
The Battle of Poitiers: One Chronicler, Fredegaire described the action as follows: "Duke Eudes, being viewed with derision throughout his lands, called against Prince Charles and the nation of the Francs, that most perfidious race of the Sarrasins [that is not accurate as Eudes had first allied himself with an Emir, but then called upon Charles for aid when events turned on him] . The Sarrasins, led by their King, Abd-el-Rahman cross Gerona [another error as they set out from Pampelona and crossed the pyrenees at Roncevaux] . After having burned the churches, and crushed the population, they arrive in Poitiers. When they burn the Basilica and destroy the residence of Saint Martin, Prince Charles put into action an audacious plan and the order of Battle is given. With the aid of Jesus Christ, our Lord, our valorous Prince destroys their tents and flies into combat to crush them..."<br>
<br>
A less glorious account is given by a monk of the Abbey of Moissac:<br>
<br>
"The King of Spain, Abd-el-Rahman, having crossed the Pyrenees with his large army from Pampelona, laid siege to Bordeaux. Then Eudes, Prince of Aquitaine, leading his large assembled army fought against the Sarrasins on the banks of the Garonne. But, from the beginning, the Sarrasins were victorious. Eudes, having to flee, recruited the assistance of Charles, Prince of the Francs. Then Charles led his armies and combat ensued in the suburbs of Poitiers [the actual battle took place 20 km North of Poitiers] . The Sarrasins having been beaten by the Francs, and their King, Abd-el-Rahman killed, fled in a most disorderly manner back to Spain. As to Charles, he returned triumphantly to France with the bounty..."<br>
<br>
The Moslems have named that field of Battle: Balad-al-Shouhada -- Place of the Martyrs of the Faith. This victory gave Charles Martel extraordinary prestige, and it is there that he is said to have crushed the arabs "like a hammer". He then occupied the Bourgogne (Burgundy) and pacified the Languedoc, and Provence, thus establishing a significant French Monarchy. He exiled the family of Eucharic of Orleans, who controlled the bishopric of Auxerre, to Hesbaye, and installed his own man, Aimar to the Holy See. Married before 726: Sunnichild de Baviere. Buried: in Oct 741 in Saint Denis, Seine, Ile-de-France, France. Died: on 22 Oct 741 in Kiersy=Quierzy, Aisne, France, Upon Charles Martel's death, his two sons divide the Kingdom in accordance with his wishes. Carloman gets Austrasia, Allemania and Thuringia; Pepin gets Neustria, Burgundy and Provence. The rest, very little, went to Grifon, a bastard child of Charles by Swannhilde, grand-daughter of the Duke of the Bavarians.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
From Wikipedia<br>
<br>
Charles Martel (Charles "the Hammer", German: Karl Martell) (August 23, 686 - October 22, 741) was born in Herstal, in what is now Wallonia, Belgium, the illegitimate son of Pippin the Middle (635 or 640 - December 16, 714) and his concubine Alpaida or Chalpaida.<br>
<br>
Although he was Mayor of the Palace of the kingdom of the Franks, Martel (Martel means "the Hammer") is best remembered for winning the Battle of Tours in 732, which has been characterized as the salvation of Europe from the Arabs spreading their empire further than the Iberian Peninsula. Martel's Frankish army defeated an Arab army, which had swept through southern Asia and north Africa, before conquering most of the Iberian peninsula and much of southern France. Martel achieved lasting greatness by inspiring his Franks to do what was thought to be impossible.<br>
<br>
It was this battle that earned Charles the cognomen "Martel," for the merciless way he smote his enemies. Most historians believe that had he failed at Tours, Islam would probably have overrun Europe.<br>
<br>
The Battle of Tours probably took place somewhere between Tours and Poitiers. The Frankish army, under Charles Martel, consisted of veteran infantry, somewhere between 15,000 and 75,000. Responding to the Muslim invasion, the Franks had marched over the mountains and avoided the old Roman roads, hoping to take the invaders by surprise. From the old Arab accounts of the battle, the Muslims were indeed taken by surprise to find a large force opposing their sack of Tours, and waited for six days, scouting the enemy. On the seventh day, the Muslim army, consisting of between 60-400,000 horsemen and led by Emir Abd er Rahman, attacked. During the battle, the Franks defeated the Islamic army and Emir Abd er Rahman was killed. While western accounts are sketchy, Arab accounts are fairly detailed that the Franks formed a large square and fought a brilliant defensive battle. Rahman had doubts before the battle that his men were ready for such a struggle, and should have had them abandon the loot which hindered them, but instead decided to trust his horsemen, who had never failed him. Indeed, as previously noted, it was thought impossible for infantry of that age to withstand armoured mounted warriors. Martel managed to inspire his men to stand firm against a force which must have seemed invincible to them, huge armoured horsemen, who in addition probably badly outnumbered the Franks. But Rahman's death led to bickering between the surviving generals, and the Arabs abandoned the battlefield the day after his death, leaving Martel a unique place in history as the savior of Europe, and the only man to ever manage such a victory between such disparate forces.<br>
<br>
Although it took another two generations for the Franks to drive all the Arab garrisons out of what is now France and across the Pyrenees, Charles Martel's halt of the invasion of French soil turned the tide of Islamic advance, and the unification of the Frankish kingdom under Charles Martel, his son Pippin the Younger, and his grandson Charlemagne prevented the Umayyad kingdom from expanding over the Pyrenees.<br>
<br>
On Pippin the Middle's death in 714, the succession passed to an infant grandson, Theodoald. The faction of Austrasian nobles who supported Theodoald was led by his stepmother, Pippin's widow, Plectrude. Charles, who was already an adult, led a rival faction and prevailed in a series of battles against both invading Neustrian Franks and the forces of Plectrude. Between 718 and 723, Charles secured his power through a series of victories and by winning the loyalty of several important clerics. This he accomplished in part by donating lands and money for the foundations of abbeys such as Echternach.<br>
<br>
In the subsequent decade, Charles led the Frankish army against the eastern duchies, Bavaria and Alemannia, and the southern duchies, Aquitaine and Provence (in Avignon, Nı̂mes, Montfrin (736), ...). He dealt with the ongoing conflict with the Saxons to his northeast with some success, but full conquest of the Saxons and their incorporation into the Frankish empire would wait for his grandson Charlemagne.<br>
<br>
Charles Martel married:<br>
   1. Chrotrud or Rotrude (690-724), with children:<br>
          * Pippin the Younger<br>
          * Carloman<br>
   2. Swanachild<br>
          * Grifo<br>
<br>
Charles Martel died on October 22, 741 at Quierzy in what is today the Aisne département in the Picardy region of France. He was buried at Saint Denis Basilica in Paris. He was succeeded by his sons, Carloman, Pippin the Younger, and Grifo.<br>

Childebert II of the FRANKS
<p>
<a name ="I010779"><b>[I010779]</b></a><br />
Childebert II (570-595), king of Austrasia, was a son of Sigebert I.<br>
<br>
When his father was assassinated in 575, Childebert was taken from Paris by Gundobald, one of his faithful lords, to Metz, where he was recognized as sovereign. He was then only five years old, and during his long minority the power was disputed between his mother Brunhilda and the nobles.<br>
<br>
Chilperic, king at Paris, and King Gontran of Burgundy, sought alliance with Childebert, who was adopted by both in turn. But after the assassination of Chilperic in 584, and the dangers occasioned to the Frankish monarchy by the expedition of Gundobald in 585, Childebert threw himself unreservedly into the arms of Gontran.<br>
<br>
By the pact of Andelot in 587 Childebert was recognized as Gontran?s heir, and with his uncle's help he quelled the revolts of the nobles and succeeded in seizing the castle of Woëwre. Many attempts were made on his life by Fredegond, who was anxious to secure Gontran's inheritance for her son Clotaire II.<br>
<br>
On the death of Gontran in 592 Childebert annexed the kingdom of Burgundy, and even contemplated seizing Clotaire's estates and becoming sole king of the Franks. He died, however, in 595. Childebert II had had relations with the Byzantine Empire, and fought in 585 in the name of the emperor Maurice against the Lombards in Italy.<br>

<br>
"Rulers of the World" by R.F.Tapsell<br>
Between 458 and 480: Childeric I became the third King of the Franks in 458. He fought with the Roman Aegidius against the Wisigoths. When Agidius died in 464, he was succeeded by Count Paul. Childeric I's army helped Count Paul push back a Saxon advance from Angers around 466. Count Paul would die in 470. They had to repeat this feat around 475, after Count Paul had died and the Saxons once again had attempted to expand into Angers.<br>

(Andre Castelot, Histoire de La France, Pages, 176, 200). Born: before 433, son of Merovee=Merovech, Prince des Francs and N?, Childeric I is presumed to have been at least 15 years of age by the time he succeeded his father in 448.<br>
<br>
Between 480 and 481 Childeric I's tomb in Tournai was discovered in 1653 and contained magnificent weapons. Buried: circa 481 in Tournai, Bigorre, France<br>
<br>
From Wikipedia<br>
<br>
Childeric I (c. 437- c. 482) was the Merovingian king of the Salian Franks from 457 until his death.<br>
[edit]<br>
<br>
Reign<br>
<br>
He succeeded his father Merovech (Latinised as Meroveus or Merovius) as king, traditionally in 457 or 458. With his Frankish warband he was established with his capital at Tournai, on lands which he had received as a foederatus of the Romans, and for some time he kept the peace with his allies.<br>
<br>
In about 463 at Orléans, in conjunction with the Roman General Aegidius, who was based at Soissons, he defeated the Visigoths, who hoped to extend their dominion along the banks of the Loire River; after the death of Aegidius he first assisted Comes ("count") Paul of Angers in a mixed band of Gallo-Romans and Franks, defeating the Goths and taking booty. Odoacer reached Angers but Childeric arrived the next day and a battle ensued. Count Paul was killed and Childeric took the city. Childeric having delivered Angers, he followed a Saxon warband to the islands at the Atlantic mouth of the Loire, and massacred them there. In a change of alliances, he also joined forces with Odoacer, according to Gregory of Tours, to stop a band of the Alamanni who wished to invade Italy.<br>
<br>
These are all the facts known about him, and they are not secure. The stories of his expulsion by the Franks, whose women he was taking; of his stay of eight years in Thuringia with King Basin and his wife Basine; of his return when a faithful servant advised him that he could safely do so by sending to him half of a piece of gold which he had broken with him; and of the arrival at Tournai of Queen Basine, whom he married, are entirely legendary and come from Gregory of Tours' Historia Francorum (Book ii.12).<br>
<br>
He died in 481 and was buried at his capital, Tournai, leaving a son Clovis, afterwards king of the Franks.<br>
<br>
His Tomb<br>
Childeric's tomb was discovered in 1653, by a mason doing repairs at the church of Saint-Brice in Tournai when numerous precious objects were found, a richly ornamented sword, a torse-like bracelet, jewels of gold and cloisonné enamel with garnets, gold coins, a gold bull's head and a ring with the inscription CHILDERICI REGIS ("of Childeric the king"), which identified the tomb. Some 300 golden bees were also in the find. Archduke Leopold William, Spanish governor of the Netherlands, had the find published in Latin, and the treasure went first to the Habsburgs in Vienna, then as a gift to Louis XIV, who was not impressed with them and stored them in the royal library, which became the Bibliothèque National at the Revolution. Napoleon was more impressed with Childeric's bees: looking for a heraldic symbol to trump the Bourbon fleur-de-lys, he settled on Childeric's bees as symbols of the French Empire.<br>
<br>
On the night of November 5-6, 1831, the treasure of Childeric was among 80 kilos of treasure stolen from the Library and melted down for the gold. A few pieces were retrieved where they had been hidden in the Seine, including two of the bees, but record of the treasure now exists only in the fine engravings made at the time of its discovery, and in some reproductions made for the Habsburgs.<br>

Clodio of the Salian FRANKS
<p>
<a name ="I010075"><b>[I010075]</b></a><br />
From Wikipedia<br>
<br>
Clodio (c. 395 - 447 or 449) or, the Long-Haired or the Hairy, was a semi-legendary king of the Salian Franks from the Merovingian dynasty (426 - 447). His successor was Meroveus, after whom the dynasty was named. Legend has it that his father was duke Pharamond and his mother was Argotta, from Thuringia. His grandfather may have been Marcomer, a duke of the Franks.<br>
<br>
There are basically only two sources of information for Clodio's history: the writings of Gregory of Tours and Sidonius Apollinaris.<br>
<br>
Clodio lived in Dispargum, a name that is believed to be that of a castle, rather than a village. Around 431, he invaded the territory of Artois, but was defeated near Hesdin by Aetius, the commander of the Roman army in Gaul, Western Roman Empire. However, Clodio regrouped and soon was able to seize the town Cameracum. Eventually, he occupied all the country as far as the Somme River and making Tournai the capital of the Salian Franks.<br>
<br>
Clodio's aggressive action to seize more territory led to centuries of expansion by his successors that ultimately created what we know today as the country of France. Clodio died sometime between 447 and 449 and power passed on to Meroveus. It is not known if Meroveus was his son or another chieftain of the tribe who ascended into the leadership role.<br>

Clothaire I of the FRANKS
<p>
<a name ="I010067"><b>[I010067]</b></a><br />
AKA: Clotaire I, King d'Orleans. AKA: Clotaire I, King d'Austrasie. Born: in 497, son of Clovis I, King des Francs and Sainte Clotilde de Bourgogne.<br>
<br>
Married between 510 and 515: Ingonthe who was Clotaire I's first wife. She gave him a daughter and five sons, three of whom survived. Married circa 516: Aregonde); Radegonde was Clotaire I's second legitimate wife. Note - between 523 and 560: In accordance with Salic Law, upon Clovis I's death, his four sons [Thierry, the eldest and born from an unknown concubine before Clovis was married, and the other three, Clodomir, Childebert and Clotaire, divided the kingdom not unlike a cake, but with unequal parts. Clotaire, the youngest, received the most primitive lands, extending from the charbonniere forest [the North of Gaule] to the Somme River and beyond to include Noyon, Soissons and Laon. Soissons was its capital. The brothers constantly engaged in bloody fights in order to augment their holdings. In 523, three of Clovis I's sons, Clotaire, Childebert and Clodomir, launch their first campaign against the Burgundians. They catch Sigismond=Zygmund, out of the Monastery of Agaune, as well as his wife and his children. They are given to the custody of Clodomir. He has the entire family murdered by throwing them into a well at Saint-Peravy-la-Coulombe [near Patay] . Clotaire I became King of Orleans in 526 and King of Austrasie in 555. He was known for his cruelty and plotted and implemented the murder of his brother's (Clodomir) sons with Childebert, his other brother. In July through December 524, two of Clodomir's sons thus are murdered. Clodomir himself had died at the Battle of Vezeronce [in Isere] on 25 June 524. Clotaire gets Tours and Poitiers. In 531 Thierry and Clotaire I are occupied in battle against the Thuringians. Their King, Hermanefried died in combat by falling from a rempart in Tolbiac [with a little push] . His mother, Radegonde, who is among the captives, becomes Clotaire's third wife. In 532, Clotaire and Childebert begin their third campaign against the Burgundians. This time, they take Autun. Upon Thierry;s death in 534, his lands are divided, and Clotaire gets the entire southern portion of Thierry's holdings including Grenoble, Die and neighboring cities.<br>
<br>
In 536, Clotaire obtains the northern part of Provence encompassing Orange, Carpentras and Gap from Vitiges, King of the Ostrogoths. When Theobald dies in 555, Clotaire gives the Auvergne to his son, Chramne. The next year, Clotaire would fail in his campaign against the Saxons, but they will continue to pay him an annual tribute of 500 cows. Chramne rebels and fights against his father. Upon Childebert's death 23 December 558, he reunited all parts of the Frankish kingdom, and Clotaire becomes sole King of the Francs. The following year, his son, Chramne again rebels, but has to seek refuge with the Count of Brittany, Conober who is established in Vannes. In 560, they lose to Clotaire and Chramne, his wife and their children are burnt alive on the orders of Clotaire. Married circa 547: Radegonde, Princess de Turinge , daughter of Hermanefried, King de Turinge (8164) and N? ; The Thuringians had been submitted to the Francs. Clotaire and his half-brother Thierry had led a brutal campaign against them and had crushed them on the banks of the Saale in 531. Among Clotaire's share of the bounty was a beautiful young girl, the Christian Princess Radegonde. Radegonde was Clotaire I's third legitimate wife, and fifth mate. Clotaire I was about 50 years old.<br>

<br>
Clotaire I (or Chlothar or Chloderic) (497 - 561), a king of the Franks, was one of the four sons of Clovis. He was born about 497 in Soissons in the Aisne, département, Picardie, France.<br>
<br>
On the death of his father in 511 he received as his share of the kingdom the town of Soissons, which he made his capital, the cities of Laon, Noyon, Cambrai and Maastricht, and the lower course of the Meuse River. But he was very ambitious, and sought to extend his domain.<br>
<br>
He was the chief instigator of the murder of his brother Chlodomer's children in 524, and his share of the spoils consisted of the cities of Tours and Poitiers. He took part in the various expeditions against Burgundy, and after the destruction of that kingdom in 534 obtained Grenoble, Die and some of the neighbouring cities.<br>
<br>
When Provence was ceded to the Franks by the Ostrogoths, he received the cities of Orange, Carpentras and Gap. In 531 he marched against the Thuringii with his brother Theuderich (Thierry) I, and in 542 with his brother Childebert I against the Visigoths of Spain. On the death of his great-nephew Theodebald in 555, Clotaire annexed his territories; and on Childebert's death in 558 he became king of all Gaul.<br>
<br>
He also ruled over the greater part of Germany, made expeditions into Saxony, and for some time exacted from the Saxons an annual tribute of 500 cows. The end of his reign was troubled by internal dissensions, his son Chram rising against him on several occasions. Following Chram into Brittany, where the rebel had taken refuge, Clotaire shut him up with his wife and children in a cottage, to which he set fire. Overwhelmed with remorse, he went to Tours to implore forgiveness at the tomb of St Martin, and died shortly afterwards.<br>

Clothaire II of the FRANKS
<p>
<a name ="I010063"><b>[I010063]</b></a><br />
Upon Clotaire's birth, his mother had his father assassinated and ruled Neustrie in his name. He became King of Soissons in 584, and was sole King of the Franks in 613. He had his aunt Brunehaut (sister of his father's second wife) killed. In the year 596, through his mother Fredegonde, Clotaire II's territories were extended in the East. In 599, King Theodebert II of Austrasia and King Thierry II of Burgundy joined forces to take revenge upon Clotaire II. The Army of Neustria is beatten and the entire valley of the Seine is devastated. As a result, Thierry II's territory increased by taking away from Clotaire II, the lands between the Seine and the Loire. Theodebert II takes the lands of the Duchy of Dentelin. In 604, the Mayor of the Palace, Bertaut arouses the subjects against the King of Burgundy and they call on Clotaire II for help. On Christmas Day, 604, Clotaire rushes to their aid and crosses the Seine and pushes all to way to Orleans. On his return, he encounters an Army of Bourgogne, and is defeated at Etampes at which battle Bertaut is killed. Because Theodebert had not intervened, actually he had made peace in Compiegne with Clotaire II, Thierry II took offense and the two brothers became less than thrilled with each other. Brunehaut, unhappy with Theodebert, names as next Mayor of the Palace a Gallo-Roman named Protadius. In 607, she pushed Thierry II to take up arms against his brother. During the battle, Protadius is killed and the two brothers make peace, humiliating their mother, Brunehaut. By 612, the brothers again were at war and Thierry II purchases Clotaire's neutrality by offering him the Duchy of Dentelin. In 613 Clotaire II invades Austrasia upon the death of Thierry II, kills two of Thierry's sons [the other two disappear] , and has Brunehaut killed after the lords of Burgundy seize her and give her to him. At her "trial" Clotaire II had accused Brunehaut of having caused the death of ten frankish Kings:<br>
1. Sigebert her first spouse, who was assassinated [though through no fault of Brunehaut] ;<br>
2. Merovee, the son of Chilperic I [who was actually assassinated on the orders of Fredegonde] ;<br>
3. Chilperic [killed in 584, and through no part from Brunehaut] ;<br>
4. Theodebert II<br>
5. of his son Clotaire [it is possible that Brunehaut had Cloraire assassinated after he deserted her] ;<br>
6. Merovee, son of Clotaire II [highly doubtful that Brunehaut had a part in this murder] ;<br>
7. Thierry II and his three sons [Thierry died of dysentery, and 8-10. his three sons were massacred on the order of Clotaire II himself]. For 3 days, Clotaire II personally tortures Brunehaut, then he parades her tied cross-wise to the back of a camel in front of his entire assembled army. Finally, he had her hair, and limbs tied to a wild horse which was allowed to run within a confined space while being beaten, therebye causing every limb to be broken and shortly thereafter she died at age 60 to 65. At this time, Clotaire II becomes the only surviving descendant of the sons of Clovis. He governs the Frankish Kingdom from the Pyrenees to the Rhine and beyond all the way to the Elbe, and the germanic peoples must pay him tribute. However, his power is limitted as in each of the three ancient kingdoms [Austrasia, Neustria and Burgundy] the Major Domus [Mayor of the Palace] becomes progressively more important. Submitting to the pressure of these mayors, Clotaire, Clotaire II on 23 January 623 makes his son Dagobert, King of occidental Austrasia [West of the Vosges and the Ardennes] as well as of Aquitaine. Again under pressure, in 626, Clotaire gives Dagobert Gomatrude [his wife's sister] as spouse. Three days after the wedding, Dagobert claims all of Austrasia was his, but Clotaire keeps control over Provence and Aquitaine. Married before 603: Bertrude . Married before 604: Haldetrude ; Haldetrude was one of three wives.<br>

<br>
Clotaire II (584-629), King of Neustria, and from 613-629 King of all the Franks, was not yet born when his father, King Chilperic I died in 584. His mother, Queen Fredegonde, was regent until her death in 597, at which time the thirteen year old Clotaire II began to rule for himself. As King, he continued his mother's feud with Queen Brunhilda of Austrasia with equal viciousness and bloodshed.<br>
<br>
In 613 Clotaire II became the first king of all the Franks since his grandfather Clotaire I died in 561 by ordering the murder of the infant Sigebert II, whom the aging Brunhilda had attempted to set on the thrones of Austrasia and Burgundia, causing a rebellion among the nobility. This led to the delivery of Brunhilda into Clotaire's hands, his thirst for vengeance leading to his formidable old aunt enduring the agony of the rack for three whole days, before suffering a horrific death, chained between four horses that were goaded in separate directions, eventually tearing her apart.<br>
<br>
In 615, Clotaire II promulgated the Edict of Paris, a sort of Frankish Magna Carta that reserved many rights to the Frankish nobles while it excluded Jews from all civil employment for the Crown. The ban effectively placed all literacy in the Merovingian monarchy squarely under ecclesiastical control and also greatly pleased the nobles, from whose ranks the bishops were ordinarily exclusively drawn.<br>
<br>
In 623 he gave the kingdom of Austrasia to his young son Dagobert I. This was a political move as repayment for the support of Bishop Arnulf of Metz and Pepin I, Mayor of the Palace of Austrasia, the two leading Austrasian nobles, who were effectively granted semi-autonomy.<br>

Clotaire II died in 629.<br>

Clovis I of the FRANKS
<p>
<a name ="I010069"><b>[I010069]</b></a><br />
King of the Salic Franks (481-511), King of France. (Came to throne at about age 15.<br>
<br>
SOURCES:<br>
Founder of the Empire of the Franks<br>
"Rulers of the World" by R.F.Tapsell<br>
<br>
Born: circa 466, son of Childeric I, King des Francs and Basine Andovera de Turinge , Clovis I became King between the Summer of 481 and Autumn of 482. According to Gregoire de Tours, he was only about 15 years of age at the time. In any case he was quite young as he was called "juvenis". Timelines here are bound to be fraught with error since the custom of counting years from the time of Jesus Christ was not established until the 8th Century. Thus, both the Larousse and the History of France assert a birth date circa 466 whereas Stuart's "Royalty for Commoners" claims Clovis I was alive in the year 420! That date is necessary to claim that Sigebert I is the son of Childebert, son of Clovis, since Stuart claims Sigebert I was King of the Salic Francs from 481 to 511.<br>
<br>
Significant-Other: Evochilde before 486 - Evochilde was a concubine. Note - between 486 and 507: King of the Franks, Clovis I vanquished the Romans at Soissons in 486. Syagrius, the "Roman King" takes refuge in Toulouse under the protection of the King of the Wisigoths, Alaric [who had just become King in 484]. By the end of the year, Clovis I forced Alaric to give up Syagrius, and Clovis I secretly has Syagrius put to death. From 487 to 490, Clovis I extended his kingdom all the way to the Loire River, however, he respects the border of the Wisigoths to the South and of the Burgundians to the South-West, as well as that of the riparian Francs to the East. From 490 to 495, Clovis is occupied with the liquidation of the Salic Franc dynasty North of Gaule. King Chararic of Tongres is decapitated, and King Ragnacaire of Cambrai is executed. Upon the request for aid from the Riparian Francs, Clovis I defeats the Alamans (Germans) at the Battle of Tolbiac in 496 thus bringing Champagne under his jurisdiction. In 500, he wages war against Gondebaud, King of Burgundy defeating him near Dijon. Gondebaud retreats to Avignon. In 502, on the Cure and the Cousin, Clovis I and Gondebaud seal an alliance. From April to June 507, the French Army attack the Wisigoths, whose Kingdom extends from the Mediterranean to the ocean, and cross the Loire, going up the Valley of Calin toward Poitiers and encounter the Visigoth Army in the plain of Vouille, 15 km West of Clain. Alaric II, King of the Visigoths is killed and the Wisigoths thus are defeated. By 507, thanks to the efforts of his son, Thierry, the entire Meridional Gaule falls into Clovis I's control. In 508, the Franc Army lays siege on Arles in order to secure Provence. Theodoric, King of the Ostrogoths, occupies Provence, and his general, Ibbas, crosses the Alps to deliver Arles from Clovis I's clutch. Theodoric conquers the Burgundians at Avignon and Orange and makes Amalaric, his grandson and son of Alaric II, King of the Wisigoths. Clovis I loses the Bas-Languedoc, then called Septimania.<br>
<br>
Around 510, Clovis has Cloderic, King of the Riparian tribes who had fought in his support at Vouille, assassinated, and proclaims himself King of the Riparians. Thus, the Kingdom extends from the Pyrenees, to the ocean to beyond the Rhine. Upon his death, according to Frankish custom, his kingdom was divided among his four sons: Thierry, Clodomir, Childebert and Clotaire. Married circa 493: Sainte Clotilde de Bourgogne , daughter of Chilperic, King de Bourgogne and N?; Clotilde was a Merovingien. By the time Clovis I married her, he already had a son through his concubine. Clotilde contributed to the conversion of Clovis to Christianity. After his death, she retired to the monastery of Saint-Martin in Tours (France). Her Feast Day is 3 June. Baptized: on 25 December 496; When the Queen, Clotilde, convinced Clovis I to have their son Ingomer baptized, he relented. Shortly afterwards, the son died.<br>

Marcomer of the East FRANKS
<p>
<a name ="I004786"><b>[I004786]</b></a><br />
Marcomer was a Frankish duke (dux, leader) in the late 4th century. Gregory of Tours mentions him in his Historia Francorum, together with dukes Genobaud and Sunno. Gregory doubts that they were called kings. They crossed the Rhine, raided the Roman province of Germania and threatened Cologne, in the latter years of Western Roman Emperor Magnus Maximus (c. 388). They reportedly also led the Chatti and the Ampsivarii. Marcomer may have been a predecessor of the legendary duke Pharamond an ancestor of the Frankish royal dynasty of the Merovingians.<br>

Before 430, the Salic Francs traverse the Escaut, and settle north of Gand [Gant] and also into Courtrai. Their chief, Clodion, takes Cambrai in 430. When Clodion died in 448, Merovee would succeed him as chief. Merovee was a Frankish Prince who ruled over the Saliennes [thus, this Merovee is King of the Salic Francs] from 452-458. He was the commander of the Francs in the great Battle of the Catalonic Fields, where he defeated Attila the Hun in 451. It is from his name that the kings of the First Race derived their name. The Huns had steadily increased their domination from humble beginnings off the Caspian sea from Caucase to the Elbe, from Muldavia to Hungary in the later part of the Fourth Century.<br>

Although he was unsuccessful against the Wisigoths, he pushed the Riparian Francs beyond the Rhine. In 440, the Riparians would return and take over Cologne and Treves.

Meroveus (c. 411-456) (Mérovée in French, Merovech, sometimes Latinised as Meroveus or Merovius) was a chief of the Salian Franks from 448-456. He is considered a semi-legendary individual, as not much information exists about him. Gregory of Tours records him but it is not clear if he was the son of Clodian or a leader who assumed power on Clodian's death.<br>
<br>
His descendants called themselves Merovingians, as the founder of what is referred to as the Merovingian Dynasty.<br>
<br>
Some researchers have noted that Merovech, the Frankish chieftain, may have been the namesake of a certain god or demigod honored by the Franks prior to their conversion to Christianity, a being described as part human, part bull and part sea-creature.<br>

Meroveus is the father of Childeric I who succeeded him.<br>

Pepin III of the FRANKS
<p>
<a name ="I004765"><b>[I004765]</b></a><br />
Pippin the Younger (714 - September 24, 768) often known under the mistranslation Pippin the Short (French, Pépin le Bref; German, Pippin der Kleine), was a King of the Franks (751 - 768).<br>
<br>
He was born in 714 in Jupille, in what is today part of Belgium, but then a part of the kingdom of Austrasia. His father was Charles Martel, Mayor of the Austrasian Palace, and his mother was Chrotrud (690-724).<br>
<br>
In 740 Pippin married Bertrada of Laon. Of their children, two sons and one daughter survived to adulthood.<br>
    * Charles / Charlemagne (April 2, 747 - January 28, 814)<br>
    * Carloman (751 - December 4, 771)<br>
    * Redburga<br>
<br>
On the death of Pippin's father, Charles Martel, in 741, power was passed down to Charles' legimitate sons, Pippin and Carloman. Power may also have been intended for Charles' illegitimate son, Grifo, but he was imprisoned in a monastery by his two half-brothers. Carloman, who by all evidence was a deeply pious man, retired to a monastery in 747. This left France in the hands of Pippin as mayor for the Merovingian King Childeric III. Childeric had the title of King but Pippin had control over orders and actually had the power of the king. Pippin then went to ask the Pope who should be complete ruler; the person with the title of king, or the person who makes the decisions of king. The Pope agreed that the decision making was more important than the title. He succeeded in obtaining the support of the papacy, which helped to discourage opposition. He was elected King of the Franks by an assembly of the Frankish leading-men and anointed at Soissons, perhaps by Boniface, Archbishop of Mainz.<br>
<br>
During his reign, Pippin's conquests gave him more power than anyone since the days of King Clovis. He added to that power after Pope Stephen II traveled all the way to Paris to anoint King Pippin in a lavish ceremony at Saint Denis Basilica, bestowing upon him the additional title of Patrician of the Romans. As life expectancies were short in those days, and Pippin wanted family continuity, the Pope also anointed Pippin's sons, Charles (eventually known as Charlemagne) and Carloman.<br>
<br>
Pippin's first major act was to go to war against the Lombard king Aistulf as a partial repayment for papal support in his quest for the crown. Victorious, he forced the Lombard king to return property seized from the church. In 759, he drove the Saracens out of France with the capture of Narbonne and then consolidated his power further by making Aquitaine a part of his kingdom.<br>
<br>
Pippin died at Saint Denis in 768 and is interred there in the Saint Denis Basilica with his wife Bertrada.<br>

Pharamond of the Salian FRANKS
<p>
<a name ="I010077"><b>[I010077]</b></a><br />
Pharamond (c. 370 - c. 430) is considered to be the first king of the Salian Franks, though he is possibly a legendary rather than historical figure. He was possibly a son or son-in-law of Marcomer.<br>
<br>
Only the later century historicians Prosper Tyron and Dom Bouquet give a report about his reign. In 420, he reportedly led his people in crossing the Rhine River and heading west. This movement would effectively separate his tribe from the majority of the Rhinefranks that had settled near Cologne. Pharamond was eventually succeeded by his son Clodio. His wife was Argotta.<br>

Thibert I of the FRANKS
<p>
<a name ="I010308"><b>[I010308]</b></a><br />
From Wikipedia<br>
<br>
Theodebert I (French Thibert I or Théodebert I), (circa 500 - 547 or 548), Merovingian king of Austrasia from 533 - 548, residence: Reims, now in northeast France.<br>
<br>
Son of Frankish king Theuderich I. Married in 533 Deuteria, a Gallo-Roman. Later abandoned Deuteria to marry Wisigarda (daughter of Wacho, king of the Langobards). Children: Theudebald (533/535 - 555), Berthoara.<br>
<br>
In the year 532 Theodebert completed, together with Gunthar (son of Chlothar I) the reconquest of territories held by his grandfather Clovis I, which had been taken by Goths following Clovis's death. After the death of Theuderich at the end of 533, Theodebert inherited his father's possessions, prevailing against the claims of his uncles Childebert I and Chlothar. The childless Childebert then allied himself with his newphew, and split with him the inheritance of Chlodomer's lands in Burgundy. Soon afterward, he adopted Theodebert.<br>
<br>
The Merovingian kings then joined to fight the Ostrogoths. Allying himself with the Gepids and the Langobards (wedding their king's daughter Wisigarda), Theodebert won the northern provinces as well as Raetien. Large parts of Venice were taken in 545, but Theodebert's party avoided a confrontation with the Byzantine Emperor.<br>
<br>
Theodebert displayed both the gifts of his family and its flaws: high statesmanship and unruly sensualism, unthinking lust for power mixed with intelligent power politics and perfidiousness. He celebrated his coronation with the striking of gold coins with his own picture and the staging of circus performances in Arles.<br>
<br>
Theodebert died in the 14th year of his reign (at the end of 547 or the beginning of 548) and his son Theudebald succeeded him.<br>
