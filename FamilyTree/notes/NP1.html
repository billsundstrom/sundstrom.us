Joan of ACRE
<p>
<a name ="I008814"><b>[I008814]</b></a><br />
From Wikipedia<br>
<br>
Joan of Acre (May 1271 - April 7, 1307) was a daughter of King Edward I of England and his first wife, Eleanor of Castile (1241-1290).<br>
<br>
Joan got her name from her birthplace, Akko (Acre), Hazofan, Palestine. It differentiates her from an earlier Joan born to the couple, who died in infancy. Joan of Acre was born while her parents were traveling to the Middle East on the Seventh Crusade. At least part of her childhood she spent in France with her maternal grandmother, Jeanne de Dammartin, Countess of Ponthieu. She was betrothed as a child to Hartman, son of King Rudolph I of Germany, but he died in 1282 after drowning in the Rhine.<br>
<br>
In 1290, at Westminster Abbey, Joan married Gilbert de Clare, 7th Earl of Hertford. He was nearly thirty years her senior. Their four children were:<br>
   1. Gilbert de Clare, 8th Earl of Hertford<br>
   2. Eleanor de Clare<br>
   3. Margaret de Clare<br>
   4. Elizabeth de Clare<br>
<br>
Following her husband's death in 1295, Joan clandestinely married Ralph de Monthermer, 1st Baron Monthermer, a knight in her household, in 1297. Her father, King Edward I, was enraged by this lowly second marriage, especially since he was arranging a marriage for her to an Italian nobleman. He had Monthermer thrown in prison, and Joan had to plead for the release of her husband. According to the St. Albans chronicler, she told her father, "No one sees anything wrong if a great earl marries a poor and lowly woman. Why should there be anything wrong if a countess marries a young and promising man?" At last her father relented, released Monthermer from prison in August 1297, and allowed him to hold the title of Earl of Gloucester and Hereford during Joan's lifetime. Monthermer and Joan had four children:<br>
   1. Mary de Monthermer, born October 1297. In 1306 her grandfather King Edward I arranged for her to wed Duncan Macduff, 8th Earl of Fife.<br>
   2. Joan de Monthermer, born 1299, became a nun at Amesbury.<br>
   3. Thomas de Monthermer, 2nd Baron Monthermer, born 1301.<br>
   4. Edward de Monthermer, born 1304 and died 1339. He fought in the Scottish campaign in 1335, but spent much of his life in service to his half-sister Elizabeth, who provided for him during his last illness and buried him next to their mother.<br>
<br>
Joan died in childbirth in 1307 at the manor of Clare in Suffolk, England, a family possession, and was buried at the Augustinian priory there. Her child was stillborn. Miracles were said to occur at her grave, especially the healing of toothache, back pain, and fever.<br>

He was born in Brattleboro, Vt., on Dec. 1, 1919, the son of George and Hattie (Bruce) Adam . <br>
Following his father's death at a very young age, he graduated from St. Michael's school there and began his quest as a self made entrepreneur. <br>
Among his early accomplishments was his partnership in the Royal Diner and the first Jeep dealership in Brattleboro, followed by the Adam 's Electronics Store in Claremont, N.H. He later moved on to Manchester, N.H., in the 1950s where he sold real estate and maintained a small electronics business selling TV tubes. <br>

Mr. Adam owned and operated the Crossroads Motor Inn and adjoining real estate at Exit 8 of the Maine Turnpike in Portland, was a principal partner in the Herald Group which developed the Diplomat and Sea Watch Condominiums on Old Orchard Beach, Maine, and assisted others in getting their start in the business world. He also fulfilled one of his many professional dreams by constructing and operating a 123-room Howard Johnson Hotel on the site of his former restaurant from 1987 to 1998 during which time Mr. Adam became one of the first inductees to the Howard Johnson Hall of Fame. <br>
His final business venture in recent years was to form the Adam Land & Cattle Co. which developed the Sparkle Plenty Car Wash and Detail Center and an adjoining Jiffy Lube, on U.S. Route 1 in Stuart. <br>

Made a desk, etc., had a nice home at 6 Vine St. Brattleboro. He was Catholic - our mother Baptist. We went to the All Souls Church in Brattleboro until near the death of our Dad.

Morton Augustus ADAMS
<p>
<a name ="I084064"><b>[I084064]</b></a><br />
My stay at the farm in Vermont was interesting and rather eventful. When I first showed up there, they were all out in the field haying and I had spent some time on small farms around Pennsylvania and knew a little bit about what was going on, but in the eyes of the folks up there, of course, I was a New York City boy. The Adamses who owned this farm, old man Morton Adams, was in his eighties at that time, and Emma, his wife, Mom Adams, I don't know how old she was, but I know that she was somewhat younger than he. They had two boys who were away at the war, Morgan and Harris Adams. They were in the Army Motorcycle Corps. There was a hired girl and there were at least two other boys that were staying there on the farm also. What the Adamses did was they took in and boarded young men and boys, who were, I guess, discipline problems or on welfare or whatever. Mom wound up leaving me there and then eventually your Aunt Peggy as well and she sent the Adamses something like $100 a month for our room and board to take care of us. Of course, the Adamses worked our asses off, or at least mine anyway, the whole time we were there. They were firm believers that you had certain responsibilities and obligations and you had to take care of these things. Now, of course, the family background that I came from this was not unusual for me.<br>
