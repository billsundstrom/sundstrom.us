France FRAZE
<p>
<a name ="I111491"><b>[I111491]</b></a><br />
France Fraze, 94, a self-styled inventor, gadgeteer and chimney sweep who cleaned the chimneys and fixed the fireplaces of thousands of Washingtonians, died Jan. 16 at the Manor Care nursing home in Chevy Chase. He had Alzheimer's disease and senile dementia.<br>
Mr. Fraze described himself as a "fireplace physician," and he made his house calls throughout the metropolitan area from a converted hearse, which he used to carry ladders, poles, brushes, chimney lights and the other equipment of his trade.<br>
He cleaned chimneys and fixed fireplaces for almost four decades. Well into his eighties, he was still climbing on roofs in Cleveland Park and Georgetown, shining his lights down chimneys and installing wire covers to keep squirrels and birds out. He retired reluctantly in the early 1990s.<br>
A manufacturer's representative and textile researcher at midlife, he found the work dull and his life unsatisfying. On the side, he had been fixing fireplaces for friends and neighbors for almost a decade. He solved his midlife crisis by becoming a full-time chimney sweep.<br>
"I think he really wanted to be his own boss, in charge of his own life. He wanted to be inventive," said his daughter Candida Fraze.<br>
To prepare for his new career, Mr. Fraze read books on physics and engineering, and he acquired English chimney sweeping equipment: three long poles that could be screwed together with brass fittings, and an assortment of brush attachments of varying sizes and shapes for chimneys.<br>
Sometimes he worked from the rooftops, sometimes from the fireplace, lying on his back on an old Oriental rug and peering up the fireplace flue with the aid of a gooseneck desk lamp to which he had rigged a metal shade. Over the years, he built a reputation for common sense solutions to the most vexing fireplace problems.<br>
Once he solved a chimney draft malfunction by locating and removing several whiskey bottles that had been hidden on the wind shelf in back of the damper. After that experience, he said, "I always look for bottles." At a home in Virginia, he installed an elevator platform to raise the grate under a free-standing copper-hooded fireplace. That heated the flue faster so it would draw smoke up the chimney more efficiently.<br>
Chimneys and fireplaces, like people, are all different, he believed, and an individual diagnosis was called for in each fireplace. "Judgment and maturity are needed," he said.<br>
Mr. Fraze, born in Chicago, traveled about the country as a young man, riding the rails with hobos. He attended the Philadelphia Textile School.<br>
During the early 1930s, he served in the merchant marine. He came to Washington in the mid-1930s. Mr. Fraze is still remembered by outdoorsmen as the survivor of a two-man canoe team that capsized trying to run the rapids in the Potomac just above Chain Bridge in 1935. His partner drowned in a whirlpool formed by the rushing water. Mr. Fraze swam to safety on the Virginia shoreline.<br>
During World War II, he served in the Army Quartermaster Corps in Washington. He later worked in the textile business in New York. He settled in Washington in 1948, living in Cleveland Park, where he later began the Chimney and Fireplace Correction Co.<br>
Most of his jobs began with a simple problem: "My chimney smokes." Mr. Fraze would then make a house call. Often, tinkering with the damper was required; sometimes it was a loose brick or mortar. Over the years, he fixed fireplaces and chimneys at the Metropolitan Club, at the old Watergate Inn and for U.S. Court of Appeals Judge David L. Bazelon, among others. Typically, he left the house each morning clad in a khaki shirt and trousers, and he returned home covered with soot just as his family was eating dinner. He was talkative and he enjoyed conversing with his clients. "I like looking at people's lives, being inside their houses and looking up their chimneys," he told his family. Until he retired, he remained convinced that the only proper way of cleaning chimneys was the old-fashioned way: with a brush and pole. He scorned vacuum or suction methods of chimney cleaning.<br>
As a businessman, he was thorough but unorthodox. He maintained a card file on everyone he worked for, but sometimes he never bothered to cash their checks. He just kept them in his files. "He just didn't think some people should have to pay," his daughter said.<br>
If anyone asked him what he did, he said: "I'm an inventor. I like to get at the inwardness of things." In the spelling of his surname, Mr. Fraze was also unorthodox. He was born France Frase, but he changed the spelling at least three times before settling on Fraze. He just liked it better that way.<br>
His wife of 41 years, Kathleen Dillon Fraze, died in 1978.<br>
Survivors include two daughters, Patricia Kellogg of Littleton, N.H., and Candida Merrill Fraze of Washington; a brother, Robert Frase of Falls Church; and three grandchildren. A son, Anthony Dillon Fraze, died in 1968.<br>
