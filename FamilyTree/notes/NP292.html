Law student offers free legal advice <br>
MADISON - Youʼre new to Madison. Youʼre one of thousands of students at the university. Youʼre in legal trouble about a lease you signed, but you canʼt afford to seek the advice of an attorney. What happens now? A year ago there was no place to turn. But today, because of the efforts of two law students at the University of Wisconsin, a student in need of legal advice can call the Community Law Office. One of its creators is Bruce Kerr, son of Mr. and Mrs. Kenneth P. Kerr, of 615 E. Newhall Ave. A second-year law student at the university, Kerr donates about 10 hours of work each week to the office. With another law student from New York City, Kerr began the program in September. A similar service was started last spring to answer student questions about leases and housing-related problems. "Many times students didnʼt know they in May, the law students began answering legal questions about "busts" and "police over-reactions," according to Kerr. The law office has since expanded. It now answers general legal questions in addition to those related to housing and criminal prosecution. A recent incident the law office handled involved a 19-year-old girl whose father would not release her phonograph record collection to her. "He thought that since it was his daughter, even though she was 19 years old, he had every right to hold her property," Kerr said. The law office informed the father of his daughterʼs rights - and she got the $300 worth of records. "With the type of problems weʼve been getting into weʼve been able to donate our own time. And itʼs a tremendous experience for us," Kerr said. The Community Law Office is associated with the Peoples Office, an information center for the "counter-culture." "At any time of the night or whenever Countyʼs Indians recalled in book Kerr "cracks" the law books regularly. thereʼs trouble, they can call us on an emergency basis," Kerr explained. Kerr doesnʼt dress like an attorney. His face is framed with a beard and long hair. Round, wire-rimmed glasses rest on his nose. And his blue jeans are tattered and somewhat faded. A 1965 honor graduate of Waukesha High School, Kerr earned slate honors for swimming while in high school. He graduated from the University of Michigan in 1969 with a Bachelor of Arts degree in history. While at Michigan, he married a national champion swimmer could tell a landlord he ʻhadʼ to repair something," Kerr said. When the Cambodia-Kent strike began . . . .<br>

Anne of KIEV
<p>
<a name ="I007747"><b>[I007747]</b></a><br />
From Wikipedia<br>
<br>
Princess Anne of Kiev (1024 - 1075), daughter of Yaroslav I, was Queen of France, as the wife of King Henri I. After the death of his first wife, Mathilde, King Henri had searched the courts of Europe for a suitable bride, but could not locate a princess who was not related to him within illegal degrees of kinship. At last he sent an embassy to distant Kiev, who returned with Anne (also called Agnes or Anna). Anne and Henri were married at the cathedral of Reims, May 19, 1051. They had three sons:<br>
    * Philippe I, King of France (May 23, 1052 - July 30, 1108)<br>
    * Hugues ("Magnus"), later Count of Crépi (1057 - October 18, 1102), who married the heiress of Vermandois and died on crusade in Tarsus, Cilicia.<br>
    * Robert (ca 1055 - ca 1060)<br>
<br>
For six years after his death in 1060, she served as regent for their son, Philip, who was 7 at the time of his father's death. She was the first queen of France to serve as regent. Her co-regent was Count Baldwin V of Flanders. Anne was known as a literate woman, rare for the time, but there was some opposition to her as Regent on the grounds that her mastery of French was less than fluent.<br>
<br>
A year after the King's death, Anne, acting as Regent took a passionate fancy for Count Raoul III of Valois and of the Vexin, a man whose political ambition encouraged him to repudiate his wife to marry Anne in 1062. Accused of adultery, Raoul's wife appealed to Pope Alexander II, who excommunicated Raoul and Anne. The young king Philippe forgave his mother, which was just as well, since he was to find himself in a very similar predicament in the 1090s. Raoul died in September 1074, at which time Anne returned to the French court. She died in 1079, and her obits were celebrated on September 5.<br>
