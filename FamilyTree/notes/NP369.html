Alice received the old family letters (in the jewelry box that C. F. Miller made for Louisa before their marriage) from Lucy's estate after her death.  She left them with her son Elbert.  Jesse's son, William, found them in Elbert's garage after his death.  They are now in Jesse's possession.<br>
<br>
Bell Gardens Cemetery is on Gage Blvd. East of Garfield Ave.<br>
<br>
From a letter written by Alice's mother:<br>
You asked me in your letter how Alice got acquainted with Mr Turner. Well I will tell you. It was through a Matrimonal Paper while at Hatties in Excelsior, 3 years ago last fall. She happened to come across a peice of one printed in Chicago with Mr Turners add. in it. She answered it and he selected her from several others to correspond with. They coresponded three years. Last fall he proposed sending the money for her to meet him part way and her father to accompany her. After due reflection, she decided to do so. They met in Oklahoma City and were married there Dec 3rd, at noon and then took the afternoon train for his home. Father was very much pleased with him and his personal appearance. They seem to be well satisfied with each other. I get a long letter from her quite often. Mr Turner & bros. have 200 acres partly timber. They raise corn and cotten. She writes that they will have lots of fruit this season. Peaches, plums, grapes & berries with all kinds of vegitables. They have wild Dewberries. They are begining to turn now and such a variety of wild flowers, she writes.<br>

Monroe Man Turns 100<br>
C.L. Miller, a long-time resident of Startup who now lives at Merrill Gardens Retirement Center in Monroe, will celebrate his 100th birthday March 28. <br>
 Miller, who remains in good health, shared some of his memories of the last century, including the last three decades in the Sky Valley. <br>
 Before arriving in Washington, Miller, one of 10 siblings and the only boy to graduate from high school, was somewhat footloose, working as a traveling salesman in the Midwest before heading to Los Angeles for work in the airplane manufacturing business. <br>
 "I had an aunt in Los Angeles," he said. "I lost my job, I was out of work, and I had interviewed with (plane builder) Lockheed with a rep. in Minneapolis. They didnʼt call and didnʼt call, so I decided to come out to Los Angeles where they were anyway." <br>
 It worked; he got the job and the career he would pursue until retirement. <br>
 He started out working on the P-38. <br>
 After six years, though, the job ended. <br>
 "Lockheed was going to lay me off, and I had a brother with a dealership in Minnesota," said Miller. "I moved back there and joined that firm." Then came World War II, and Lockheed cranked up production. Back to Los Angeles went Miller, working on the P-38, this time outfit- ting the planes with guns for the war effort. He also worked on the C-69, a large cargo plane. After a while, he became a teacher, which led to his next job. <br>
 "I was teaching about the airplanes," he said. Some people from a company called AirResearch Manufacturing came in to take a class form him. "I asked them if they had jobs in their field service department." <br>
 He switched careers after clearing it with military, as those involved in the war effort were required to do in those days, and continued to teach about airplanes for the rest of his career. <br>
 He also had a large family; he and his wife Dorothy had seven children. Upon retirement, in 1972, he moved to Startup. <br>
 "I built the first house in Startup in two years," he said. "They hadnʼt had any houses built in that long." He and Dorothy bought a manufactured home on two acres and joined the Hillcrest Baptist Church in Sultan. <br>
 After 68 years of marriage, Dorothy died in 2000. Miller moved to Merrill Gardens three years ago, at the age of 97. <br>
 He currently lives there with his second wife, Lois Carpenter Miller. He will celebrate his birthday with his five surviving children at the Northshore Senior Center in Bothell. Many of his 20 grandchildren, 41 great-grandchildren and six great- great-grandchildren are expected to attend. <br>

Della Rae attended her first year of college in Oklahoma City, transferring the next year to SDSU in Brookings, SD where she received her Bachelor of Science Degree in Secondary Education in 1971.<br>
All throughout her school years, Della Rae would return home to spend her summers haying and helping with Bible Schools and Camp.<br>
After college, she pursued her chosen career at her chosen place, teaching high school mathematics back at Sunshine Bible Academy.<br>
Music was always important to Della Rae. She enjoyed singing with her grandmother as a child. Her mother started teaching her piano very early and she continued blessing people with her musical talents throughout her life. She enjoyed singing with her husband and family and spent time teaching music to her children when they were young. She enjoyed being one of the pianists for the church and also accompanying the local quartet.<br>
Della Rae loved to sew and knit, and made many individualized gifts for family and friends. Bookkeeping was another of her passions. She prepared income tax for many years and most recently kept books for Country Coffees in Union Center. <br>
On Aug. 17, 1974 Della Rae married the love of her life, her longtime friend, Sam Mickelson. Together they first worked and traveled for SBA, later settling at their home along Cedar Canyon. Along with raising sheep, cattle, and most recently buffalo, they raised a family of three boys and three girls, who were their pride and joy. Their blessings increased as each grandchild arrived. From about the early to mid eightyʼs Della Rae tried to publish a weekly newsletter that was shared with family and friends. This became what we know now as "Mickelson Moments". Even when her family became scattered she was trying to keep them all connected and informed.<br>
Grateful for having shared her life are: her husband of 39 years , Sam, and six children and their families, Travis and Haley Mickelson, and children Natalie, Tarrence, and MaKeltie of Mud Butte, SD; Fran Mickelson of Union Center, SD; Tim and Courtney Mickelson and children Toby, Soleil, Ciera, and Ruby, of rural Faith (Maurine), SD; Tyler and Jennifer Mickelson and son Will of Mandan, ND; Faye Lynn and Levi Stoddard and children Reece, Sidney, and Paisley of Garrison, ND; and Felicia and Chris Cammack of Union Center, SD.<br>
Other survivors include her father Shirley Miller of Mud Butte; her sister Reta Fae and Ken Kelly of Ada, KS and many nieces and nephews.<br>
Della Rae lost her fight with cancer and went to be with the Lord she loved, joining her mother Erma Miller, two infant sons and many family and friends and neighbors who have preceded her in death.<br>
Memorials have been established to the New Prairie Home Church and the Cedar Canyon Bible Camp.<br>
