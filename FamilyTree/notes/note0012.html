On Daisy's marriage record, she is Daisy 'Ward'.  Daisy lists her parentsas Edward and Mary, although the 1901 census lists her as theirgranddaughter, (last name Smith) so I would guess Edward and Mary musthave raised her so she considered them her parents. Or possibly she didnot know they weren't. Her birth mother was a child Wilemina Smith, adaughter of Mary Smith's first marriage.  Wilemina was the informant onher death certificate, where the name of  Daisy's father is found.<br />

He was a great Norman feudal baron. Probably he was a grandson of one ofthe viking chiefs of Scandinavia who accompanied Rollo about 900 A.D. inthe Norse invasion of northern France where they permanently settled andgave to the country its name "Normandy". Torf possessed numerouslordships in Normandy, being Seigneur de Torville, Torcy, Torny, Torly,du Ponteautord,etc. It has been suggested that he was a son of Bernardthe Dane, the most powerful of the feudal nobles of Normandy during thereign of Duke William I. (927-943) and Regent during the minority of DukeRichard I. (943-955); but this claim has not been proved.Some genealogiesshow his parents as Bernard of Saxony and Spriota de Bourgogne, but thisis most certainly fabricated. - Todd Farmerie<br />

Ancestral Roots (line 190-9) states that Itta is supposed daughter ofArnoldus Bishop of Metz. Obviously there is no convincing evidence, oneway or the other, just hints & estimations. I had previously determinedthat Dode was possibly/probably daughter of Arnoldus, which (if Itta wereher sister) would make Saint Begga and her husband Ansgise/Ansgisel 1stcousins. While marriages between 1st cousins were not uncommon duringthis era, these people were supposedly close to the church and may nothave countenanced such a marriage.<br />
 <br />
Thus I have decided to adopt the following ancestry for Itta, given below in a post to SGM, 18 Feb 2003, by David Hughes (nothing is sure):<br />

Subject: Re: Attila the Hun<br />
Newsgroups: soc.genealogy.medieval<br />
Date: 2003-02-18 10:11:27 PST<br />
 <br />
I am curious about the sudden interest in Attila The Hun & the genealogy of his house. . . for what it is worth here are my notes on the subject for consideration:<br />
 <br />
x. Donaton, King of Huns [1], enters Europe, circa AD 360, issue, three sons:<br />
a. Basiq, King of Huns [2], d c 370<br />
b. Balamber, King of Huns [3], attacks Byzantine empire, d 390<br />
c. Uldin (Uldes), King of Huns [4] 390-411<br />
 <br />
The two sons of Uldin [4] (above) were<br />
a. Karaton (Charaton), King of Huns [5] 411-?, the father of Octar,<br />
King of Huns [6]<br />
b. Kuridak<br />
 <br />
The two sons of Prince Kuridak (above) were<br />
a. Rugila, King of Huns [7] ?-433<br />
b. Mundzuk<br />
 <br />
The two sons of Prince Mundzuk (above) were<br />
a. Bleda, King of Huns [8] 433-437<br />
b. ATTILA<br />
-------------------------------<br />
 <br />
x. ATTILA "THE HUN" & "The Scourge", King of Huns [9] 437-453 had several wives: =1 Arykan; =2 Helche (Kreka); =3 Kriemhilt; =4 Ildiko (Hildiko); =5 Gundrun [note: a German myth says that his Burgundian wife, Gundrun, murdered her twin sons, Erpe & Eiti, begotten by him, and served their hearts for Attila to eat]<br />
 <br />
Issue:<br />
a. Scharpfe, murdered 453<br />
b. Ortelipe, murdered 453<br />
[Note: the sons of ATTILA quarreled after his death over the chieftainship, during which, Ardaric, the Gepidae king, rallied the Germans against their Hunnish masters and utterly defeated the Huns at the Battle of Nedao, 456, after which the remnant of the Huns gathered around the sons & grandsons of Attila "the Hun", creating several groups, of which some remained in Germany and Central Europe while others retreated to Scythia-Minor and became the Magyars, Bulgars, & Mongols]<br />
c. Ellak, King of Huns [10] 453-456 [possibly the father of Aella of Sussex & Alesa of Wessex]<br />
d. Tuldila, King of Huns [11] 456-7<br />
e. Dengizec, King of Huns [12] 457-469, the father of Oulibus (d469)<br />
f. Sengilac, the father of Sunigila (daughter), wife of Odovacar, a Teutonic chieftain, conquered the Roman Empire & became King of Italy 476-493<br />
g. Emnetzur<br />
h. Ultzindur<br />
i. Elpfrat<br />
j. Tingiz<br />
k. Bel-Kermek (475), father of Djurash "Masgut" (498/499), father of Tatra (Baltavar) (550s), father of Boyan-Chelbir (d590), father of Tubdjak, King of Magna-Bulgaria (620), father of (a) Bu-Yurgan (Organas) & (b) Alburi (d632), father of Kubrat, 1st King of Bulgaria 632-651 [note: Kubrat is called the "son" of Organus in one source, and called his "nephew" in another source, as the son of his brother, Alburi]<br />
l. Ernak [called Attila's "youngest son"], King of Huns [13] 469-476<br />
m. Escam (Ascama) (daughter), wife of Ardaric, a Gepidae chief/king<br />
-----------------<br />
 <br />
Note: the descent-line from Attila The Hun to Charlemagne posted recently on the net is incorrect, however, the descent can be made through the wife of Pepin of Landen rather than through his mother, which then would be:<br />
 <br />
00. Attila The Hun (d453)<br />
01. Escam (Ascama) = Ardaric, Gepidae-King of Germany (d476)<br />
02. Elemund (d493/515)<br />
03. Austrisa = Waccho, Lombard-King of Italy (d540)<br />
04. Walderade =1 Theudebald, King of France 548-555 [Note: she =2 Clothaire I of France; & =3 Garibald I of Bavaria]<br />
05. Grimoalde, Duke of Aquitaine (d599) = Itite (d612), daughter of Severus, a duke<br />
06. Itte (Idoberge) (d652) = Pepin [I] of Landen (d639)<br />
07. Begga (d694) = Ansgise (d685)<br />
08. Pepin [II] of Heristal (d714) =2 Aupais<br />
09. Charles "Martel", Duke of France 737-741 =1 Rotrude<br />
10. Pepin "Le Korte", King of France 751-768 = Bertha "The White-Lady"<br />
11. Charlemagne<br />

Roger de Montgomerie, 1st Earl of Shrewsbury was known as Robert "the Great" of Montgomery (English). Son of another Roger de Montgomerie, who was a relative, probably a grandnephew, of duchess Gunnor, wife of duke Robert I of Normandy. The elder Roger had large holdings in central Normandy, chiefly in the valley of the Dives, which the younger Roger inherited.<br />
 <br />
Roger was one of William the Conqueror's principal counselors. He did not fight in the initial invasion of England in 1066, instead staying behind to help govern Normandy. Afterwards he was entrusted with land in two places critical for the defense of England, receiving the Rape of Arundel at the end of 1067 (or in early 1068), and in November 1071 he was created Earl of Shrewsbury. (A few historians believe that while he received the Shropshire territories in 1071 he was not created earl until a few years later.)<br />
 <br />
Roger was thus one of the half a dozen greatest magnates in England during William the Conqueror's reign. In addition to the large part of Sussex included in the Rape of Arundel, and seven-eights of Shropshire which were associated with the earldom of Shrewsbury, he had estates in Surrey, Hampshire, Wiltshire, Middlesex, Hertfordshire, Gloucestershire, Worcestershire, Cambridgeshire, Warwickshire and Staffordshire.<br />
 <br />
After Williams's death in 1087, Roger had joined with other rebels to overthrow the newly crowned king William Rufus in the Rebellion of 1088. However William was able to convince Roger to abandon the rebellion and side with the king, which was fortuitious as the rebels were beaten and lost their land holdings in England. Roger first married Mabel of Bêlleme, who was heiress to a large territory on both sides of the border between Normandy and Maine. By her he had 10 children:<br />
    Roger Montgomery, d. 1066<br />
    Robert of Bellême, 3rd Earl of Shrewsbury<br />
    Hugh of Montgomery<br />
    Roger the Poitevin<br />
    Philip, d. 1099 died while on crusade at the Siege of Antioch<br />
    Arnulf of Montgomery<br />
    Emma, abbess of Almenchêches<br />
    Matilda,  m. Robert, Count of Mortain<br />
    Mabel,  m. Hugh of Châteauneuf-en-Thimerais.<br />
    Sibyl,  m. Robert Fitzhamon.<br />
 <br />
Roger then married Adelaide of Le Puiset, by whom he had one son, Everard, who entered the Church.<br />
 <br />
After his death, Roger's estates were divided. The eldest surviving son, Robert, received the bulk of the Norman estates (as well as his mother's estates); the next son, Hugh, received the bulk of the English estates and the earldom of Shrewsbury. After Hugh's death the elder son Robert inherited the earldom.From Wikipedia<br />

Memorial services were held Sunday, Oct. 24, at St. James Catholic Churchfor Walter Oscar Hussa, 89, who passed away Thursday, Oct. 21, 2004 atthe Surprise Valley Hospital in Cedarville.<br />
Hussa, a Surprise Valley native, born to W.H. and Elizabeth Donnelly Hussa on April 28, 1915 in Cedarville, was second in a family of three children: the eldest, Frances, died in infancy; Walter; and Margaret Hussa Queirolo of Sacramento.<br />
On Nov. 9, 1938, Hussa and Katherine Gooch, also a native of Surprise Valley, were married in Los Angeles and returned to Cedarville to make their home.<br />
To this union was born son, John, and daughter, Nancy.<br />
Hussa entered the butcher trade after graduating from Surprise Valley High School and completing two years of study at Herald Business College in Sacramento. He continued working alongside his father W. H. Hussa in the plant and behind the retail counter. Years earlier, the company had expanded the retail meat trade with shops in Ft. Bidwell and Alturas, and into cattle ranching as well. Alkali Cattle Company, comprised of P. B. Harris, Lee Heryford and W.H. Hussa, trailed its cattle 60 miles east to summer pasture on Badger Mountain and the surrounding country in Nevada. Alkali Cattle Company held a grazing permit on Sheldon Antelope Range from 1938 until the mid 1980s. The cattle wintered on the home ranches in Surprise Valley.<br />
Hussa was a member of the Cedarville Fire Department for 68 years, a volunteer department founded by his father. He was a charter member of the Surprise Valley Rotary club and honored as a Paul Harris Fellow for active service.  In 1998, he was awarded a jacket and a pin for 60 years of service, and in 2004 Hussa completed his 66th year as a Rotarian. He served the community and region in many capacities and was a member of the school board; Modoc County Cattleman's Association; Modoc County Bull Sale Committee; and the BLM Stewardship Committee.

Memories of Walt Hussa by Ron Morgan<br />
I worked in a grocery store, Lowell and Williams, in Alturas in the late thirties, before and after school and all day Saturday. This grocery store also had a meat market within the store. The store was owned by Walter Hussa and was managed by Arthadeus Rachford.<br />
Walt would make about two trips per week from Cedarville to Alturas to keep the store stocked with meat and to assist Mr. Rachford with cutting, packaging and grinding meat for sale. One day he was grinding up a big batch of hamburger meat when he let out quite a howl. Somehow he got his thumb caught in the grinder and of course lost that thumb. To this day I often wonder whether that particular batch of ground beef was sold or thrown out. Money was pretty hard to come by then.<br />
Walt was a large person, not only in size but in personality and capability. I used to think that he was pretty old, but he was only a few years older than I. Perspective is often non-existent when you are young.<br />
In 1937, Alturas suffered a flood. I hooked a ride in a row boat to the Lowell and Williams store and started the clean up with the rest of the employees. When it came time for lunch, nobody had anything prepared. We helped ourselves to some salami from the meat market and bread and mayonnaise from the store and the eight of us, that were there, had quite a feast on Salami sandwiches. I remember Arthadeus trying to explain to Walt that he had no idea what happened to all of the salami that had been stocked in that meat case.<br />
Those were the days that when you accompanied your mom to the meat market you were always given a wiener to eat by the butcher. Also, in those days, beef liver was given to customers, requesting it, for their dogs. A loaf of bread cost a dime, a quart of milk cost a dime, and you could get a Polly Ann Bakery berry pie for 35 cents. On special occasions my lunch consisted of a whole berry pie and a quart of milk. When I spent my money for that lunch, I only earned a nickel for my days work. It was a different time then with different values.<br />

Robert, Count of Mortain (d. 1095) was a half-brother of William the Conqueror, and became a great landholder in both England and Normandy.<br />
 <br />
He was the son of William the Conqueror's mother Herleva, and Herluin, viscount of Conteville. Odo, Bishop of Bayeux was his older full brother. He was probably born around 1040, but perhaps a few years earlier.<br />
 <br />
Around 1055 Duke William was consolidating his hold on the duchy, and having disposessed the count of Mortain, gave the county to Robert. Mortain was a frontier territory, bordering on Brittany and Maine, and Robert contributed to the defense of the duchy by constructing castles at the town of Mortain, and at St. Hilaire-du-Harcouet, le Tilleul, and Tinchebrai.<br />
 <br />
During the next decade Robert was a close counselor of his half-brother, appearing frequently at his court, including the councils at which the invasion of England was planned. He surely fought at the Battle of Hastings itself, though he chronicles of the time are not specific, and more importantly he contributed a significant part of the invasion fleet.<br />
 <br />
After the conquest, Robert obtained a large holding in England, including the strategic Rape of Pevensey in Sussex, and other lands guarding London, including Berkhamsted, Lambeth and Bermondsey. In 1072 he was entrusted with Cornwall after the previous ruler returned home to Brittany, though probably he never formally became earl. Nevertheless he was the second greatest lay magnate in England.<br />
 <br />
Robert seems to have been uninterested in English politics -- some say he lacked the cleverness for it -- and he spent most of the remainder of the Conqueror's reign in Normandy. He stayed loyal to William to the end, even when his brother Odo of Bayeux rebelled and was imprisoned. At the dying duke's bedside he successfully argued for Odo's release.<br />
 <br />
Odo seems to have pushed him into action, for Robert took part in the Rebellion of 1088 which attempted to replace William Rufus with Robert Curthose. After Pevensey surrendered and the rebellion failed, Rufus pardoned Robert, while Odo was exiled to Normandy. Their differing treatment may reflect contemporary assessment of Robert's lack of initiative.<br />
 <br />
He married Matilda, daughter of Roger of Montgomery, 1st Earl of Shrewsbury, and was succeeded by their son William, Count of Mortain.<br />

From Wikipedia<br />
 <br />
Henry Percy, 2nd Earl of Northumberland, (3 February 1392 /1393 - 22 May 1455) was the son of Henry Percy and his wife Elizabeth de Mortimer, daughter of Edmund Mortimer, 3rd Earl of March and Philippa Plantagenet.<br />
 <br />
He was restored to favor in 1416 by Henry V of England, receiving the estates of his paternal grandfather Henry Percy, 1st Earl of Northumberland the re-creation of his earldom.<br />
 <br />
He was apparently loyal to Henry V till the death of the later on 31 August 1422. Henry V was succeeded by his one-year-old son Henry VI of England. Percy was on the regency council in the early years of the new reign.<br />
 <br />
Percy was later involved in the Wars of the Roses which placed him in an awkward situation. He owed his loyalty to the House of Lancaster but was first cousin of Anne Mortimer and kinsman to her son Richard, Duke of York, head of the House of York. On 22 May, 1455, Percy fought on the Lancastrian side in the First Battle of St Albans, first battle of the Wars. He was among the casualties.<br />
 <br />
Marriage and children<br />
Percy married Lady Eleanor Neville, daughter of Ralph Neville, 1st Earl of Westmorland and his second wife Joan Beaufort. Her siblings included Richard Neville, 5th Earl of Salisbury and Cecily Neville.<br />
They had two children:<br />
    * Henry Percy, 3rd Earl of Northumberland (25 July 1421 - 29 March 1461).<br />
    * Lady Katherine Percy. She married Edmund Grey.<br />

Arnulf I, called der Böse ("the Bad" or "the Evil") (died July 14, 937),was duke of Bavaria from 907 until his death. He was a member of theLuitpolding dynasty.<br />
 <br />
Arnulf was the son of Margrave Luitpold of Bavaria and Kunigunde, daughter of Berchthold I, count of Swabia. Besieged by frequent raids by the Hungarians and desperate to raise funds to finance a defence, Arnulf strengthened his power through confiscation of church lands and property, which earned him the nickname "the Bad". He re-established the duchy of Bavaria and eventually negotiated a truce with the Hungarians who thereafter largely passed though Bavaria on their raids into other German territories. Arnold vigorously resisted Emperor Conrad, Duke of Franconia (and the second husband of Arnulf's mother Kunigunde), but later submitted to Conrad's successor as King of the Germans, Henry the Fowler of Saxony, who confirmed Arnulf's sovereignty over Bavaria.<br />
 <br />
Arnulf was married to Judith of Friaul, daughter of Count Eberhard of Sülichgau and Gisela of Verona. Arnulf's daughter Judith married Henry I of Bavaria, brother of Otto I, Holy Roman Emperor.<br />
 <br />
Arnulf died in Regensburg in 937 and was buried in St. Emmeram.<br />

Artist Dies<br />
MRS. HENRY LALK DIES WEDNESDAY<br />
Was Famous Artist in Oils; Funeral Service Saturday<br />
Mrs. Henry Lalk, 48, well known Wisconsin artist died at her home on route 2, at 5:40 p.m. Wednesday.<br />
Formerly Millie Rose Brinker, she was born March 5, 1895, in Iowa and was married to Henry Lalk on Sept. 6, 1916, at Janesville.  Practically all of her married life was spent in this community.<br />
She was a member of the Christian Science society and a member of the Pythian Sisters.<br />
The Christian Science funeral service will be read by Harold Kafer at 2 p.m. Saturday in the Downing funeral chapel.  Interment will be in Evergreen cemetery.  Friends may call at the chapel Friday.<br />
Famous for Paintings<br />
Mrs. Lalk gained considerable fame for her oil paintings, particularly her rural landscapes, which she was invited to exhibit at many art shows, including those in Chicago, Springfield, IL, Beloit college, the Memorial Union art exhibit at the University of Wisconsin, and the Madison Art association. One of her oil paintings called "Our Farm in Wisconsin Landscape with Lake Koshkonong in the Distance" is now on exhibit at the Springfield museum.<br />
Last fall Mrs. Lalk was especially honored when she was asked to exhibit her works at a one-artist show in the Wustum museum at Racine.  About tow years ago one of her paintings was reproduced in Life magazine with a picture of the artist at her easel.<br />
On three separate occasions she was accepted to exhibit at the Sculptors and Painters showing in Milwaukee.  The third was a distinct recognition, since it made her eligible for membership in the organization.<br />
Outstanding Rural Artist<br />
The Madison Art association, which holds an exhibition every winter at the Memorial Union purchased from Mrs. Lalk, a rural oil painting showing the Lalk farm several years ago to add to their traveling exhibit.<br />
She received recognition in the Milwaukee Journal in September, 1942, when she was described as Wisconsin's outstanding rural artist.<br />
Mrs. Lalk's outstanding talent was recognized by John Stewart Curry, artist in residence at the University of Wisconsin, and Robert Von Neuman, well known Milwaukee artist, and was encouraged to continue her paintings.<br />
Some Pastel Sketches<br />
Most of her work was done in oils but she did some pastel sketches of orchids, four of which are now owned by the Fort Atkinson Memorial hospital, some water color work and tempera.  She also sculptured. Most of her paintings were of rural scenes in Wisconsin.<br />
Every year she entered some of her paintings at the State Fair and won many first prizes there, every year winning a ribbon.  The College of Agriculture at Madison has on display several of her oils.<br />
After an article about her appeared in the Chicago Tribune she received many requests to talk about her painting at clubs and organizations in surrounding towns.<br />
Mrs. Lalk, who studied at the Chicago Art institute and in Milwaukee, is credited with organizing and teaching the first class in fine arts in Fort Atkinson.<br />
In 1938 she received honorable mention in the national safety poster contest in which there were 3,026 entries.  Her painting was one of the few in that group to be sent out on exhibition.<br />
Surviving besides her husband, Henry Lalk, are two sons, Warren and Robert of Midland, MI, both of whom are employed at the Dow Chemical company there; two sisters, Mrs. Dwight Wiley of Delavan, MN, Mrs. Effie Hawley, Seattle, WA;  two brothers, Dewey Brinker, Paukwanna, SD, Charles Brinker, Saint Peter, MN; half brother, Dr. Clarence Hotchkiss of Beaver Dam; and two grandchildren.<br />
--------------------------------------------------------------<br />
From Rural artists of Wisconsin (1948)<br />
For Forty years Millie Rose Lalk lived the harmonious, uneventful life of a conventional, mild-mannered American. During this time her only art work was the painting of an occasional oil as she stole time from her many duties as mother, farm housewife, and friendly neighbor. Then, almost suddenly, she became a serious painter aware of new principles, intent upon new meanings, and productive of far more significant work. For years this farm woman had dabbled at painting drab, uninspired oils of grapes and pears and of chromo-like landscapes of mountains, lakes, and hunting scenes. Searching through her small collection of early work one finds nothing to suggest the power of expression and experimental textures she was to develop during the last few years of her life.   The art classes she attended in high school had inspired her to do nothing more original nor exciting than a series of school-girl portraits of fashionable young ladies in the manner of James Montgomery Flagg. Nor did three months' attendance at a special course offered by the Chicago Art Institute have any marked effect. The metamorphosis may be explained in part by the inner brooding of spirit that a series of especially profound experiences engendered in her. When in 1935 her youngest son died, her husband noticed a change in her personality. She became introspective and began to devote much more of her time to sketching and painting. For a time, however, her renewed interest in painting resulted in nothing exceptional. She received honorable mention for a poster submitted in a national contest, and she undertook a number of large barn murals near Fort Atkinson, advertising Guernsey cows for the local breeders' association.   There can be little doubt that among the experiences that were most fruitful for Mrs. Lalk was a series of meetings with Curry. In 1940, having entered a rather prosaic oil, "Filling Silo," in the first Rural Art Exhibit, she attended Curry's tour of the gallery. He appraised and criticized each picture before the assembled group of rural artists. She listened thoughtfully to his succinct advice: "Use more color.... Develop your own style. Don't change it for someone else's.... Paint the world you see about you.... Paint the things about which you have feeling." The next year Mrs. Lalk submitted a large, ambitious oil depicting her own family group busy in a barnyard full of huge sows and their litters. When someone criticized the immense snout of one of the sows as being out of proportion, Curry replied, "That's a part of the design; it looks more like a pig than a pig does." A year later Mrs. Lalk succeeded in placing an oil - a modern, symbolic treatment of the subject of the golden calf -among the professionals in the annual Wisconsin Salon. Thereafter until her death in August, 1943, Mrs. Lalk's work received increasing recognition.<br />
   Perhaps the most profound event in her life was her discovery in 1941 that she was seriously ill. A deeply religious woman, she refused to be shocked out of her normal way of life or to give way to invalidism. Few people knew that she was a sick woman, but it may have been her awareness that time was running out which prompted her to offer advice to all those who, endowed with a little talent, were planning to have fun with it "when there is time" - which for most people means when they grow old. "Don't wait," she said on one occasion in 1942. "Play around with your hobby as you live your busiest years. It keeps you stimulated and interested, and you may surprise yourself by developing something really good." She herself had led too busy a life to realize her own potentialities. She was born on the edge of the town of Whitewater in 1895. Her father, John Brinker, a machinist of Dutch ancestry, kept the family of six on the move as he obtained employment in various small woolen mills in the midwest. When Millie Rose started school the family lived in Grafton in Ozaukee County. Two years later the Brinkers were in Maguoketa, Illinois. But that job, like the rest proved to be temporary, and soon they were again living in Wisconsin, this time in Janesville. When she was graduated from the local high school in 1913, Millie Rose was undecided about the future. Two years later she entered the Janesville Business College, where she met Henry H. Lalk, a fellow student. Their marriage in 1916 was followed by two brief attempts at business, one with the Jamesway Company and the other operating an auto livery. In 1917 the young couple decided to farm and moved to eighty acres near Chippewa Falls. There the first of three boys was born in 1918. The young farmer's wife was much too busy to spend any more time at the easel. A year later the farm was sold, and they moved three times in rapid succession. Finally, in 1926 they bought a hundred-acre farm on the Janesville road. It lies among rolling hills dotted with tree clumps and commands a view of Lake Koshkonong. It was this farm that supplied subjects for Mrs. Lalk during the 1940's.   When her two boys had left for the University and she had moved to a country home near Fort Atkinson, she was able to transfer her energies to art. In the few short years that remained to her, she crowded the days with activity. Months before her death she knew she had not long to live, but she continued to work with remarkable productivity. In the autumn of 1942 she was asked to exhibit her work in a one-artist show at the Wustum Museum at Racine. In September she had been recognized by the Milwaukee Journal as Wisconsin's outstanding rural artist. For the third time her work was shown at the Sculptors and Painters exhibition in Milwaukee, making her eligible for membership    in that organization. Her entries at the state fair brought her two first prizes. She was featured in Life, and an article about her in a Chicago newspaper brought numerous invitations to talk about her paintings before organizations in near-by towns. She is credited with organizing and teaching the first fine arts class in Fort Atkinson. She was among the first to be selected by the Rural Art Committee for representation in the Permanent Collection. Her works were exhibited by the Madison Art Association, Beloit College, the Milwaukee Art Institute, Purdue University, and in 1943 the Chicago Art Institute. Her painting "Our Farm in Wisconsin with Lake Koshkonong in the Distance" was requested from the Chicago exhibit by the Illinois State Museum at Springfield, where it was hanging at the time of her death. She had continued active and productive until the last two and a half weeks of her life.   What was the secret of those creative years? It was as if she had borrowed time and was hastening to repay it with a gift which was to live for her. Or perhaps the educational philosophers have a word for it: that dreams and hopes may lie buried in the minds of men to awaken long after the age when the schools suggest that we stop learning.<br />

ROGER DE TOENI III, styled also DE CONCHES, 1st son and hei r, was bornprobably about 1104, and succeeded his father about 1126. In 1131 heattested Henry I's pan-carte confirming all the grants of his ancestorsand himself and others t o the abbey of Conches. He is said to have wagedwar with Hugh de Chateauneuf in 1133. In 1135 the King suspected that hewas preparing to rebel, together with William Talvas, Count of Ponthieu,on behalf of Henry's son-in-law, Geoffrey Plantagenet, and sent his ownsoldiers to garrison the castle of Conches. After the King's death, Rogersupported Geoffrey and his wife the Empress Maud against Stephen. AfterEaster 1136 hostilities began between him and the King's generals, thetwins Waleran, Count of Meulan, and Robert, Earl of Leicester; and civilwar raged in May and June. In the autumn the fighting flared up again;but on 3 October Roger was ambushed and captured by Count Waleran andHenry de la Pommeraye. His land was laid under an interdict and he waskept in prison for more than 6 months, but was released in 1137 . InMay1138 he was attacked by the Count of Meulan and William d'Ypres, butdefended himself successfully; and on 7 September he captured Breteuiland burnt the town. However, be fore the end of 1138 he made peace withthe twin Earls, who conducted him to England, where he was reconciled toKing Stephen. Nothing is known of what happened to his English landsduring this period. In 1150 or 1151 he was with Henry, Duke of Normandy,at Rouen. After Henry had become King, Roger enjoyed the royal favor; forbetween Michaelmas 1157and Michaelmas 1158 the King granted him 100solidates of l and at Holkham, Norfolk. He was a benefactor to the abbeysof la Noë, Conches and Bec.<br />
 <br />

With he r he had in marriage from Henry 120 librates of land out of t he royal demesne at East Bergholt, Suffolk. He died after Michaelmas 1157 and probably before 1162.[Complete Peerage XI I/1:763-4, (transcribed by Dave Utzinger)]<br />

Björn was the father of Olof (II) Björnsson and Eric the Victorious,according to Hervarar saga. He was the grand-father of Styrbjörn Starke.According to Hervarar Saga he was the son of an Erik who fought HaraldFairhair who succeeded the brothers Björn at Hauge and Anund Uppsale.Erik Anundsson is the only Erik who fits.<br />
 <br />
In the saga of Olaf the Holy, Snorri Sturluson quotes Thorgny Lawspeaker on king Björn:<br />
 <br />
    My father, again, was a long time with King Bjorn, and was well acquainted with his ways and manners. In Bjorn's lifetime his kingdom stood in great power, and no kind of want was felt, and he was gay and sociable with his friends.<br />
 <br />
When Björn died Olof and Eric were elected to be co-rulers of Sweden. Eric would however disinherit his nephew Styrbjörn.<br />
 <br />
Adam of Bremen, however, only gives Emund Eriksson as the predecessor of Eric the Victorious. Since the Swedes seem to have had a system of co-rulership (Diarchy), it is probable that Emund Eriksson was a co-ruler of Björn's.<br />

According to "Samuel Allen of Windsor, CT," NEHGS "Register," Vol 30, pg.444 and Allen Family Papers, pg. 19, Samuel was born in Braintree, Essex,England, in about 1588, although other, more recent sources give hisbirth as about 1608. Jacobus disagrees and believes that he was morelikely born about 1608, about age 60 at his death. He allegedly came toCambridge in 1632 and removed to CT in 1635 where he settled at Windsor.He was likely brother to Deacon Thomas Allyn/Allen of Middletown, CT, butnot likely related to Col. Matthew Allyn of Cambridge and Windsor andThomas Allen of Barnstable who were brothers. These relationships areconfirmed in The Allen Memorial which quotes numerous sources in statingthat Samuel and Thomas were brother and that they had no knownrelationship to Matthew and Samuel of Braintree.<br />
 <br />
From the Allen Memorial, pg. 14: "...the first undoubted official record of Samuel Allen is found in the<br />
Windsor land records as follows:<br />
 <br />
"January 27, 1640, Samuel Allen hath granted from the plantation at Windsor, Conn., 1st An house lot, being six acres, three rods, ten poles, bounded from the rivulet to the west by Rodger Ludlow on the south, by Thomas Marshall on the north, and runs in length to the west into a highway laid out into some part of the lot of said Rodger Ludlow and his, the said Samuel Allen."<br />
 <br />
"2d In Plymouth meadow, four acres, bounded by Bray Rossiter on the north and a rivulet that runs into the great river on the south. 3d Toward Hartford, nineteen acres, more or less, and runs in length to the Great River to the west one hundred and thirty and four rods, and is bounded by John Witchfield on the north and by Thomas Marshfield on the south. 4th Over the Great River next to the same, fifteen rods in bredth, in the length to the east three miles; bounded by Joseph Lumus on the south, John Hurd on the north."<br />
 <br />
Samuel Allen may have been at Windsor as early as 1636 and his land was entered 27 Jan. 1641 and included a house lot of over 6 acres. Samuel was a juryman 5 March 1645 and was a farmer. He died and was buried at Windsor 28 April 1648, leaving a widow and 6 children. The inventory of his estate was taken 8 Sept. 1648 and totaled 76 pounds, 18 shillings and 8 pence. His wife married a second time, to Wm. Hurlbut, and removed to Northampton, MA. His tombstone at the Enfield Street Cemetery, Enfield, CT indicated "1588-1648."<br />

From Wikipedia<br />
 <br />
Friedrich I. von Hohenstaufen (1122 - June 10, 1190), also known as Friedrich Barbarossa ("Frederick Redbeard") was elected king of Germany on March 4, 1152 and crowned Holy Roman Emperor on June 18, 1155. He was also Duke of Swabia (1147-1152, as Frederick III) and King of Italy (1154-1186). As son of Duke Frederick II of Swabia (German Schwaben) and Judith of Bavaria, from the rival House of Guelph (or Welf), Frederick descended from Germany's two leading principal families, making him an acceptable choice for the Empire's princely electors as heir to royal crown.<br />
 <br />
In 1147 Frederick became duke of Swabia and shortly afterwards made his first trip to the East, accompanying his uncle, the German king Conrad III, on the Second Crusade. The expedition proved to be a disaster, but Frederick distinguished himself and won the complete confidence of the king. When Conrad died in February 1152, only Frederick and the prince-bishop of Bamberg were at his deathbed. Both asserted afterwards that Conrad had, in full possession of his mental powers, handed the royal insignia to Frederick and indicated that he, rather than his own six-year-old son, the future Frederick IV, Duke of Swabia, should succeed him as king. The kingdom's princely electors were persuaded by this account and by Barbarossa's energetic pursuit of the crown and he was chosen as the next German king at Frankfurt on the 4th of March and crowned at Aix-la-Chapelle (Aachen) several days later.<br />
 <br />
The new king was anxious to restore the Empire to the position it had occupied under Charlemagne and Otto I the Great, and saw clearly that the restoration of order in Germany was a necessary preliminary to the enforcement of the imperial rights in Italy. Issuing a general order for peace, he was prodigal in his concessions to the nobles. Abroad, Frederick intervened in the Danish civil war between Svend III and Valdemar I of Denmark, and negotiations were begun with the East Roman emperor, Manuel I Comnenus. It was probably about this time that the king obtained a papal assent for the annulment of his childless marriage with Adela (Adelheid) of Vohburg (through whom he had gained ownership of much of Alsace), on the somewhat far-fetched grounds of consanguinity (his greatgreatgrandfather was a brother of Adela's greatgreatgreatgrandmother), and made a vain effort to obtain a bride from the court of Constantinople. On his accession Frederick had communicated the news of his election to Pope Eugenius III, but neglected to ask for the papal confirmation. Eager to make amends with the Papacy, Frederick concluded a treaty with Rome in March 1153, by which he promised in return for his coronation to support the Pope in his relations with the rebellious citizens of Rome.<br />
 <br />
He undertook six expeditions into Italy, in the first of which he was crowned emperor in Rome by Pope Adrian IV in the aftermath of the overthrow by Imperial forces of the republican city commune led by Arnold of Brescia. He left Italy in the autumn of 1155 to prepare for a new and more formidable campaign. Disorder was again rampant in Germany, especially in Bavaria, but general peace was restored by Frederick's vigorous measures. Bavaria was transferred from Henry II Jasomirgott, margrave of Austria, who became duke of Austria in compensation, to Frederick's formidable younger cousin Henry the Lion, duke of Saxony, of the house of Guelph/Welf. On June 9, 1156 at Würzburg, Frederick married Beatrice of Burgundy, daughter and heiress of Renaud III, becoming King of Burgundy and adding the sizeable realm of the County of Burgundy, then stretching from Besançon (Bisanz) to the Mediterranean, to his possessions.<br />
 <br />
In June 1158, Frederick set out upon his second Italian expedition, accompanied by Henry the Lion and his fearsome Saxons, which resulted in the establishment of imperial officers in the cities of northern Italy, the revolt and capture of Milan, and the beginning of the long struggle with Pope Alexander III, which resulted in the excommunication of the emperor in 1160. In response, Frederick declared his support for Antipope Victor IV. Returning to Germany towards the close of 1162, Frederick prevented the escalation of conflicts between Henry the Lion of Saxony and a number of his neighbouring princes who were growing weary of Henry's power, influence and territorial gains. He also severely punished the citizens of Mainz for their rebellion against Archbishop Arnold. The next visit to Italy in 1163 saw his plans for the conquest of Sicily ruined by the formation of a powerful league against him, brought together mainly by the taxes collected by the imperial officers.<br />
 <br />
Frederick then organized the magnificent celebration of the canonization of Charlemagne at Aix-la-Chapelle, while restoring the peace in the Rhineland. In October 1166, Frederick went once more on journey to Italy to secure the claim of his Antipope Pascal, and the coronation of his wife Beatrice as Holy Roman Empress. This campaign was stopped by the sudden outbreak of the plague which threatened to destroy the Imperial army and drove the emperor as a fugitive to Germany, where he remained for the ensuing six years. This time, Henry of Saxony had refused to join Frederick on his Italian trip, tending instead to his own disputes with neighbors and his continuing expansion into Slavic territories in northeastern Germany. Conflicting claims to various bishoprics were decided and imperial authority was asserted over Bohemia, Poland, and Hungary. Friendly relations were entered into with the East Roman emperor Manuel, and attempts were made to come to a better understanding with Henry II of England and Louis VII of France.<br />
 <br />
In 1174, Frederick made his fifth expedition to Italy and, in response, the pro-papal Lombard League was formed to stand against him. With the refusal of Henry the Lion to bring help to Italy, the campaign was a complete failure. Frederick suffered a heavy defeat at the battle of Legnano near Milan, on May 29, 1176, where he was wounded and for some time believed to be dead. He had no choice other than begin negotiations for peace with Alexander III and the Lombard League. In the Peace of Venice, 1177, Frederick and Alexander III reconciled. The Emperor acknowledged the sovereignty of the Papal States, and in return, Alexander acknowledged the Emperor's overlordship of the Imperial Church. The Lombard cities, however continued to fight until 1183, when, in the Peace of Constance, Frederick ceded the right to freely elect town magistrates.<br />
 <br />
Frederick did not forgive Henry the Lion for his refusal to come to his aid in 1174. Taking advantage of the hostility of other German princes to Henry, who had successfully established a powerful and contiguous state comprising Saxony, Bavaria and substantial territories in the north and east of Germany, Frederick had Henry tried in absentia by a court of bishops and princes in 1180, declared that Imperial law overruled traditional German law, and had Henry stripped of his lands and declared an outlaw. He then invaded Saxony with an Imperial army to bring his cousin to his knees. Henry's allies deserted him, and he finally had to submit in November 1181. He spent three years in exile at the court of his father-in-law Henry II of England, before being allowed back into Germany, where he finished his days as duke of Brunswick, peacefully sponsoring arts and architecture, and died on 6 August 1195.<br />
 <br />
After making his peace with the Pope, Frederick embarked on the Third Crusade (1189), a grand expedition in conjunction with the French army, led by king Philip Augustus together with the English, under Richard Lionheart. He organized a grand army and set out on the overland route to the Holy Land, through Hungary and Romania, and arrived at Constantinople in autumn 1189. From there they pushed on through Anatolia (where they were victorious in two battles) into Armenia, and approached Syria. The approach of the immense German army greatly concerned Saladin and the other Muslim leaders, who began to rally troops of their own and prepare to confront Barbarossa's forces. However, Frederick Barbarossa was never to see the Holy Land. On June 10, 1190 while crossing the Saleph River in Cilicia, south-eastern Anatolia, Frederick was thrown from his horse and the shock of the cold water caused him to have a heart attack. He drowned in water that was barely hip-deep, according to the chronicler Ibn al-Athir.<br />
 <br />
Frederick's death plunged his army into chaos. Leaderless, panicked, and attacked on all sides by Turks, many Germans were killed or deserted. Only 5,000 soldiers, a tiny fraction of the original forces, actually arrived in Acre. His son Frederick VI of Swabia carried on with the remnants of the army, with the aim of burying the Emperor in Jerusalem, but efforts to conserve his body in vinegar failed. Hence, his flesh was interred in the Church of Saint Peter in Antiochia, his bones in the cathedral of Tyre, and his heart and inner organs in Tarsus.<br />

Frederick's untimely death left the Crusader army under the command of the rivals Philip of France and Richard of England, who had traveled to Palestine separately by sea, and ultimately led to its dissolution. Richard Lionheart continued to the East where he fought Saladin with mixed results, but ended without accomplishing his main goal, the capture of Jerusalem.<br />
Frederick sends out the boy to see whether the ravens still fly.<br />
 <br />
Frederick is the subject of many legends, including that of a sleeping hero, derived from the much older British Celtic legend of Bran the Blessed. He is said not to be dead, but asleep with his knights in a cave in Kyffhäuser mountain in Thuringia, Germany, and that when ravens should cease to fly around the mountain he would awake and restore Germany to its ancient greatness. According to the story his red beard has grown through the table at which he sits. His eyes are half closed in sleep, but now and then he raises his hand and sends a boy out to see if the ravens have stopped flying.<br />

POCASSET - Charlie was born in 1930 to parents Charles Marshall FosgateSr. and Edna Steele Fosgate in Cambridge. He passed away November 15,2010, following a long illness. Charlie was a native son, grandson andgreat-grandson of Cambridge, educated in Cambridge schools and a HarvardGraduate, class of 1951. His major work life was devoted to management inthe field of technical sales of chemicals for coated fabrics. In lateryears Charlie left industry to start his own business. In 1985 he foundeda retail store of gifts and all things photographic called Picture Thisin Sandwich and Pocasset. He always prided himself on being on thecutting edge and indeed was in photographic developments. People rememberhis radio ads starting with, "Hi, this is Charlie at Picture This."<br />
Before moving to their summer home in Pocasset, the family lived in Sudbury for 27 years. There he initiated a community project which began as a mission for the Memorial Congregational Church of a training program for CPR. He trained instructors as well as taught CPR in private, civic and commercial establishments. In Pocasset he expressed his civic concern by working to reopen the Pocasset Fire House, so vital in this community.<br />
Charlie's first love besides his family and community was boating and sailing. He grew up in the summers on wonderful Old Silver Beach and often said the first 17 summers of his life were happy there. Boating started very early with sailing off the beach and then more formally out of West Falmouth Harbor. Buzzards Bay was his playground and as the years went by he sailed all manner of boats from a beautiful old cutter to a Hobie Cat up and down the bay and enjoyed the beauties of Quissett and Hadley's Harbors and the Elizabeth, Martha's Vineyard and Nantucket Islands. Later there were many trips to the Caribbean on small boat cruises and sailing on chartered boats. His other love was skiing and he enjoyed the major ski slopes in New England including climbing into Tuckerman's Ravine for summer skiing. Later he discovered the thrills of western skiing in Aspen. He enjoyed it all over again when skiing with his children.<br />
Charlie hated gush and superficial enthusiasm. He believed in calling a fact a fact, and dealing with it in a realistic way. He always preferred to stay on the high road of common sense. People who did not know him well sometimes thought his manner was a bit brusque; however, when they knew him better, they grew to appreciate the kindness of his heart, his quiet helpfulness to others. He was a true friend and a devoted family man.<br />
He is much loved by his family, his wife of 55 years, Florence Potter Fosgate, daughter Sandy Fosgate Clark and her husband Louis Clark and children Emily and Louie of Plymouth, as well as son Charles Hastings Fosgate and wife Michelle and sons Andrew and Kevin of Frederick, Md. He is also survived by sister Phyllis Black and her husband Delbert Black of Pocasset and North Carolina and sister Claire Kehn of Granby, Conn., and many nieces and nephews. Remembered by dear friends of the North Falmouth Congregational Church.<br />
A memorial service for Charlie will be held at the North Falmouth Congregational Church, 155 Old Main Road, North Falmouth at 2 p.m., Saturday, November 20, 2010. Remembrances in his name may be made to Cape Cod Health Care Foundation, Box 370, Hyannis, MA 02601 or North Falmouth Congregational Church, P.O. Box 403, North Falmouth, MA 02556.<br />

 <br />
Philip of Swabia (1177-1208), German king and duke of Swabia, the rival of the emperor Otto IV, was the fifth and youngest son of the emperor Frederick I and Beatrix, daughter of Renaud III, count of Burgundy, and consequently brother of the emperor Henry VI. He entered the clergy, was made provost of Aix-la-Chapelle, and in 1190 or 1191 was chosen bishop of Würzburg. Having accompanied his brother Henry to Italy in 1191, Philip forsook his ecclesiastical calling, and, travelling again to Italy, was made duke of Tuscany in 1195 and received an extensive grant of lands. In 1196 he became duke of Swabia, on the death of his brother Conrad; and in May 1197 he married Irene, daughter of the eastern emperor, Isaac II, and widow of Roger III, Titular King of Sicily, a lady who is described by Walther von der Vogelweide as " the rose without a thorn, the dove without guile."<br />
 <br />
Philip enjoyed his brother's confidence to a very great extent, and appears to have been designated as guardian of the young Frederick, afterwards the emperor Frederick II, in case of his father's early death. In 1197 he had set out to fetch Frederick from Sicily for his coronation when he heard of the emperor's death and returned at once to Germany. He appears to have desired to protect the interests of his nephew and to quell the disorder which arose on Henry's death, but events were too strong for him. The hostility to the kingship of a child was growing, and after Philip had been chosen as defender of the empire during Frederick's minority he consented to his own election. He was elected German king at Muhlhausen on March 8, 1198, and crowned at Mainz on the September 8 following.<br />
 <br />
Meanwhile a number of princes hostile to Philip, under the leadership of Adolph, archbishop of Cologne, had elected an anti-king in the person of Otto, second son of Henry the Lion, duke of Saxony. In the war that followed, Philip, who drew his principal support from south Germany, met with considerable success. In 1199 he received further accessions to his party and carried the war into his opponent's territory, although unable to obtain the support of Pope Innocent III, and only feebly assisted by his ally Philip Augustus, king of France. The following year was less favourable to his arms; and in March 1201 Innocent took the decisive step of placing Philip and his associates under the ban, and began to work energetically in favour of Otto.<br />
 <br />
Also in 1201, Philip was visited by his cousin Boniface of Montferrat, the leader of the Fourth Crusade. The Crusaders were by this time under Venetian control and were besieging Zara on the Adriatic Sea. Although Boniface's exact reasons for meeting with Philip are unknown, while at Philip's court he also met Alexius Angelus, Philip's brother-in-law. Alexius convinced Boniface, and later the Venetians, to divert the Crusade to Constantinople and restore Isaac II to the throne, as he had recently been deposed by Alexius III, Alexius and Irene's uncle.<br />
 <br />
The two succeeding years were still more unfavourable to Philip. Otto, aided by Ottokar I, king of Bohemia, and Hermann I, landgrave of Thuringia, drove him from north Germany, thus compelling him to seek by abject concessions, but without success, reconciliation with Innocent. The submission to Philip of Hermann of Thuringia in 1204 marks the turning-point of his fortunes, and he was soon joined by Adolph of Cologne and Henry I, Duke of Brabant.<br />
 <br />
On January 6, 1205 he was crowned again with great ceremony by Adolph at Aix-la-Chapelle, though it was not till 1207 that his entry into Cologne practically brought the war to a close. A month or two later Philip was loosed from the papal ban, and in March 1208 it seems probable that a treaty was concluded by which a nephew of the pope was to marry one of Philip's daughters and to receive the disputed dukedom of Tuscany. Philip was preparing to crush the last flicker of the rebellion in Brunswick-Lüneburg when he was murdered at Bamberg, on June 21, 1208, by Otto of Wittelsbach, count palatine in Bavaria, to whom he had refused the hand of one of his daughters. Philip was a brave and handsome man, and contemporary writers, among whom was Walther von der Vogelweide, praise his mildness and generosity.<br />
 <br />
Philip of Swabia married Irene Angelina on May 25, 1197. Their four daughters were:<br />
    * Beatrice of Hohenstaufen (1198-1212), married Otto IV, Holy Roman Emperor<br />
    * Cunigunde of Hohenstaufen (1200-1248), married King Wenzel I of Bohemia<br />
    * Mary of Hohenstaufen (1201-1235), married Henry II, Duke of Brabant<br />
    * Elizabeth of Hohenstaufen (1203-1235), married King Ferdinand III of Castile<br />

Natalie Constance Fridley was born October 15, 1921, to Otto Sundstrom and Helen (Johnson) Sundstrom on a farm south of Artesian, SD and lived in the Artesian area for the first 88 years of her life.<br />
Natalie married Charles Marion Fridley in Redfield, SD on January 5, 1946. Charles died in 1976. As many of the family phrased it, Natalie can finally meet up with Charles again in heaven; he has waited for her long enough.<br />
Natalie attended Goering Country School and graduated from Artesian High School in 1939. She graduated from Dakota Wesleyan University with a two-year teaching degree. She eventually received her four-year degree. Natalie taught in country schools and public schools in Fedora, Woonsocket, Alpena and Carthage. After she retired, she substituted at Artesian School for many years. She also worked for Saint Joseph Hospital for several years.<br />
Natalie was a member of First Lutheran Church in Artesian, the Ladies Aid of First Lutheran, American Legion Auxiliary, Post 47 of Artesian, the Artesian Cemetery Association and various other community organizations.<br />
Natalie loved company and was quick to give you her opinion on whatever subject was on her mind. She enjoyed her grandchildren and great-grandchildren as well as hearing from her former students. She didnʼt like to go to Senior Citizens (but she did) in Artesian because it was all "old people" there and nobody wanted to play 500. She didnʼt like to play pitch.<br />
Natalie is survived by her four children: Kathryn Marie (Dale) Wormstadt of Rapid City, SD, Thomas James Fridley, Artesian, SD, David Charles (Sara) Fridley of Mitchell and Daniel Gene Fridley (Shelly Gramm, fiancée) of Sioux Falls, SD.

She was preceded in death by her husband, Charles, her parents, a grandson, Bradley Thomas, and ten brothers and sisters: Laurence, Ernest, Lennart, Adney, Daine, Signe, Ann Marie, Elsie, Olga and Erma.<br />

Isaac II Angelus, Byzantine emperor 1185-1195, and again 1203-1204, was the successor of Andronicus I.<br />
 <br />
He inaugurated his reign by a decisive victory over the Normans in Sicily, but elsewhere his policy was less successful. He failed in an attempt to recover Cyprus from the rebellious noble Isaac Comnenos thanks to Norman interference and by the oppressiveness of his taxes drove the Bulgarians and Vlachs to revolt (1186). In 1187 Alexius Branas, the general sent against the rebels, treacherously turned his arms against his master, and attempted to seize Constantinople, but was defeated and slain. The emperor's attention was next demanded in the east, where several claimants to the throne successively rose and fell. In 1189 Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor sought and obtained leave to lead his troops on the Third Crusade through the Byzantine Empire; but he had no sooner crossed the border than Isaac, who had meanwhile sought an alliance with Saladin, threw every impediment in his way, and was only compelled by force of arms to fulfil his engagements.<br />
 <br />
The next five years were disturbed by fresh rebellions of the Vlachs, against whom Isaac led several expeditions in person. During one of these, in 1195, Alexius, the emperor's brother, taking advantage of the latter's absence from camp on a hunting expedition, proclaimed himself emperor, and was readily recognised by the soldiers. Isaac was blinded and imprisoned in Constantinople. After eight years he was raised for six months from his dungeon to his throne once more after the arrival of the knights of the Fourth Crusade. But both mind and body had been enfeebled by captivity, and his son Alexius IV was the actual monarch. Isaac died in 1204, shortly after the usurpation of his general, Mourzouphles. He was one of the weakest and most vicious princes that occupied the Byzantine throne. Surrounded by a crowd of slaves, mistresses and flatterers, he permitted his empire to be administered by unworthy favourites, while he squandered the money wrung from his provinces on costly buildings and expensive gifts to the churches of his metropolis.<br />

King of Vestfold, King of Norway, had many wives and concubines,undertook conquest of Norway to win Gytha, and until successful refusedfor ten years to cut or comb hair (called Lufa, "the Slovenly"), became1st King of all Norway abt. 883/890, cut hair after conquest (then called"Fairhair"), won Gytha, d. abt. 936.<br />
 <br />
MISC: Harald inherited three small domains from his father in eastern, central, and western Norway, and set out to conquer the rest of Norway. According to the medieval saga, he was motivated by the refusal of Gyda (another petty king's daughter) to marry him until he had conquered all of Norway. According to the story, King Harald declared that he would not cut or comb his hair until he had conquered all of Norway. When he finally had victory about ten years later, he then had his hair done and was called "Fairhair." The chieftains of western Norway were the hardest to defeat, but Harald attained his victory in the Battle of Hafrsfjord about 885. Harald was a strong ruler, and managed to unite Norway. At Harald's death, his sons divided Norway with the favorite son, Eric Bloodaxe, as the overking, but dissensions and wars disrupted the unity of the country.<br />
 <br />
Alternatively, there are references that spell his first name "Harold," and list his death date as being 933 or 945.<br />
 <br />
He succeeded to the throne of his father's kingdom as a child in 860.<br />
 <br />
Age at death: Over 72.<br />
 <br />
He was the first king of United Norway.<br />

following is from Randy Jones, World Connect db=randyj2222, rootsweb.com:<br />
--------------------------------------------------------------------------  ------------<br />
 <br />
The history of Norway prior to the late tenth century is extremely obscure, and the lineage of Harald is uncertain prior to his father. The old poem Ynglingatal is quoted (incompletely, with some missing stanzas of unknown content) in Heimskringla (early thirteenth century), and appears to have been composed in the late ninth or early tenth century, although that is not certain. Even if we grant for the moment that Heimskringla quotes an accurate version of an early poem, we still have the fact that Ynglingatal only gives the names of the kings, and does not supply any of the genealogical relationships which appear in so many later sources. It is not until sources of the twelfth century that there is any clear indication that the king mentioned in each stanza was regarded as the son of the king mentioned in the previous stanza, and this could easily be a very late invention. That the kings listed in the last few stanzas existed may be regarded as likely, but they remain very shadowy figures whose exact historical and genealogical connections are nebulous. At various times in the past, attempts have been made to identify one or more of them with individuals known from contemporary historical sources, but there are no identifications of the kings in Ynglingatal with known historical figures which can be regarded as certain. -- Stewart Baldwin<br />
 <br />
 <br />
The source for this is a fragment of Ynglingatal repeated in Snorri's Heimskringla. Snorri wrote his work about 400 years after the events it is describing. It tells of Olaf Tree-Cutter founding Norway, and passing it to his son Halfdan Whiteleg. Halfdan had sons Eystein and Gudrod. Eystein had a son Halfdan. He was followed by Gudrod, son of Halfdan, and he was father of Olaf, father of Ragnevald, for whom the original poem was composed. The classical reconstruction is that this is a straight shot (Olaf- Halfdan- Eystein- Halfdan- Gudrod- Olaf- Ragnevald). However, it has been suggested that Gudrod, son of Halfdan Whiteleg sticks out like a sore thumb. He neither succeeded, nor is there any reason for him being mentioned at all (no other "other sons" are mentioned). Maybe, the speculation runs, he is the Gudrod Halfdanson who later became king - that Halfdan Eysteinson was followed not by his son, but by his uncle. One could argue this in circles, but it doesn't matter.An analysis of the succession after Rognevald reveals a splice between two traditions. Halfdan the Black is made son of Gudrod born of a second marriage, and left an infant coheir with his "brother" Olaf. The location of his rule is nowhere near the location where his predicessors are said to have ruled, and later his son Harald is made to defeat all of the other kinglets of Norway, including kings of places that Halfdan was supposed to have ruled. Finally, what appears to be a near-contemporary poem celebrating Halfdan the Black seems not to know his father. To make a long story short (too late! you say), it looks like the new dynasty, descended from Halfdan the Black, were attached after the fact to the family celebrated in the Ynglingatal (who actually appear to have been enemies that they displaced). Nothing before Halfdan the Black can be trusted, and it is not clear that the lines back to Harald Fairhair should be trusted either. The whole "kidnappped as an infant and didn't come back until an adult at the head of a strong army" thing about Olaf Trygvison smells foul. St. Olaf owed his position to being Olaf I's right-hand man, while Harald Hardrade was his step-brother. I have my serious doubts about the Fairhair pedigrees attached to each of them. -- Todd Farmerie<br />

 <br />
From Wikipedia<br />
 <br />
Harald Fairhair (Old Norse:Haraldr hinn hárfagri, Icelandic:Haraldur hinn hárfagri, Norwegian:Harald Hårfagre) (c. 850 - c. 933) was the founder and first king (872 - 930) over Norway.<br />
 <br />
He succeeded on the death of his father Halfdan the Black Gudrødsson in A.D. 860 to the sovereignty of several small and somewhat scattered kingdoms, which had come into his father's hands through conquest and inheritance and lay chiefly in south-east Norway.<br />
 <br />
The constitution of Norway is, according to a tale, somewhat of a love story. The tale begins with a marriage proposal that resulted in rejection and scorn from Gyda, the daughter of a neighbouring king. She said she refused to marry him before he was king over all of Norway. Harald was therefore induced to take a vow not to cut nor comb his hair until he was sole king of Norway, and that ten years later he was justified in trimming it; whereupon he exchanged the epithet "Shockhead" for the one by which he is usually known. Whether this is actually true is debatable; the name "fairhair" may simply mean that Harald had blonde hair.<br />
 <br />
In 866 he made the first of a series of conquests over the many petty kingdoms which then composed Norway, including those which had sworn allegiance to the Swedish king Erik Eymundsson. In 872, after a great victory at Hafrsfjord near Stavanger, he found himself king over the whole country. His realm was, however, threatened by dangers from without, as large numbers of his opponents had taken refuge, not only in Iceland, then recently discovered, but also in the Orkney Islands, Shetland Islands, Hebrides Islands and Faroe Islands, and in Scotland itself; and from these winter quarters sallied forth to harry Norway as well as the rest of northern Europe. Their numbers were increased by malcontents from Norway, who resented Harald's claim of rights of taxation over lands, which the possessors appear to have previously held in absolute ownership. At last Harald was forced to make an expedition to the west to clear the islands and Scottish mainland of Vikings. A great number of them fled to Iceland, which grew into an independent commonwealth, while the Scottish isles fell under Norwegian rule.<br />
 <br />
The latter part of Harald's reign was disturbed by the strife of his many sons. He gave them all the royal title and assigned lands to them which they were to govern as his representatives; but this arrangement did not put an end to the discord, which continued into the next reign. When he grew old he handed over the supreme power to his favourite son Eirik Bloodaxe, whom he intended to be his successor. Harald died in 933, having had eight wives and 23 children. Twelve of his sons became kings, two of them over the whole country.<br />

In 987, Robert's father had the nobles crown him as successor at Orléans on December 30th, thereby confirming the house of Capet as rulers of France. After Robert became king he did as his father and crowned his eldest son Hugh Magnus as his successor. But, due to Prince Hugh Magnus's death, another son, Henri, became king.<br />
 <br />
Robert, despite marital problems that saw him temporarily excommunicated by Pope Gregory V, was a very devout Roman Catholic, hence the name Robert the Pious. He was very musically inclined and was a composer, a chorister, and a poet, making his palace a place of religious seclusion, where he conducted the matins and vespers in his royal robes. Part of Robert's piety at the time, was because he did not tolerate heretics and harshly punished them.<br />
 <br />
The kingdom Robert inherited was not large, and in an effort to increase his power, he vigorously pursued his claim to any of the feudal lands as they became vacant which action usually resulted in war with a counter-claimant. In 1003, his invasion of Burgundy was thwarted and it would not be until 1016 that he was finally able to get the support of the Church and be recognized as the Duke of Burgundy.<br />
 <br />
The pious King Robert II made few friends and many enemies, including his own sons. His eldest son Hugh Magnus died suddenly while in rebellion against his father. Robert's surviving sons, Henri and Robert, also turned against their father, in a civil war for power and property. King Robert's army was beaten and he retreated to Beaugency outside Paris.<br />
 <br />
He died in the middle of the war with his sons on July 20, 1031 at Melun, France. He was interred with his third wife, Constance of Arles (973-July 25, 1032) in Saint Denis Basilica. He was succeeded by his and Constance's second son, Henri I.<br />
 <br />
Robert II married:<br />
 <br />
    * c. 989, 1) Susanne (Rosala), Princess of Italy (c.945 - January 26, 1003). Widow of Count Arnulf II of Flanders. She was much older than Robert, and the marriage was arranged by his father. Robert divorced her a year later.<br />
 <br />
    * c. 996, 2) Bertha, Princess of Burgundy (952-1035). Widow of Count Theobald II of Blois. Because she was his cousin, Pope Gregory V would not sanction the marriage and Robert was excommunicated. However, after long negotiations with the new Pope Silvester II the marriage was annulled.<br />
 <br />
    * In 1001, 3) Constance of Arles (973-July 25, 1034) Daughter of a certain Count William, an intriguing and ambitious woman, who made life miserable for her husband. She was the mother of his children:<br />
   1. Advisa, Countess of Auxerre, (c.1003-after 1063), married Count Renaud I of Nevers<br />
   2. Hugh Magnus, co-king (1007-September 17, 1025)<br />

   4. Adela, Countess of Contenance (1009-June 5, 1063), married (1) Duke Richard III of Normandy (2) Count Baldwin V of Flanders<br />
   5. Robert I, Duke of Burgundy (1011-March 21, 1076)<br />

From Wikipedia<br />
 <br />
Hugh Capet (French: Hugues Capet) (938 - October 24, 996) was King of France from 987 to 996. Capet is a nickname for "wearing a cape".<br />
 <br />
Born in 938 in Paris, he came from a powerful and influential family of the Germanic aristocracy of France, two members of which had already been elected King of France in the ninth and tenth centuries. Hugh Capet was the eldest son of Hugh the Great, then the most powerful man in the kingdom, maker of kings, and of Hedwige of Saxony (c.910-c.965), daughter of King Henry I (the Fowler) of Germany and sister of German Emperor Otto I. Hugh Capet wanted to become a lay abbot, and in 980 arranged to move the relics of St. Valery to Amiens Cathedral. He inherited his father's vast estates and became the most powerful noble of his time. From 978 to 986, Hugh Capet allied himself with the German emperors Otto II and Otto III and with archbishop Adalbero of Reims to dominate the weak Carolingian king, Lothair. By 985, he was king in all but name. After Lothair and his son died in early 987, the archbishop of Reims convinced an assembly of nobles to elect Hugh Capet as their king. He was crowned King of France at Noyon, Picardie on July 3, 987, the first of the Capetian dynasty to rule France.<br />
 <br />
Hugh Capet possessed minor properties near Chartres and Anjou. Between Paris and Orléans he possessed towns and estates amounting to approximately 400 square miles (1,000 km2). His authority ended there, and if he dared travel outside his small area, he risked being captured and held for ransom or even murdered. Indeed, there was a plot in 993 masterminded by the Bishop of Laon and Eudes I of Blois to deliver Hugh Capet into the custody of Otto III. The plot failed, but the fact that no one was punished illustrates how tenuous his hold on power was. Beyond his power base, in the rest of France, there were still as many codes of law as there were fiefdoms. The country operated with 150 different forms of currency and at least a dozen languages. Uniting all this into one cohesive unit was a formidable task and a constant struggle between those who wore the crown of France and its feudal lords. As such, Hugh Capet's reign was marked by numerous power struggles with the vassals on the borders of the Seine and the Loire. Beyond his realm, the investiture and then deposition of Arnulf, nephew of the duke of Lorraine, as archbishop of Reims involved the king and bishops in conflict with Pope John XV that was not yet resolved at Hugh Capet's death in 996.<br />
 <br />
While Hugh Capet's military power was limited and he had to seek military aid from the Duke of Normandy, his unanimous election as king gave him great moral authority and influence.<br />
 <br />
Hugh Capet married Adelaide of Aquitaine (952-1004), daughter of Duke William III of Aquitaine. Their children were:<br />
   1. Avoise (970-1013)<br />
   2. Robert II (March 27, 972 - July 20, 1031)<br />
   3. Alice (974-1079)<br />
   4. Gilette (born c.976)<br />
   5. Gisele (born c.978)<br />
 <br />
Hugh Capet died on October 24, 996 in Paris, and was interred in the Saint Denis Basilica. He was succeeded by his son, Robert II.<br />
