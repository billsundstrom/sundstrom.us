Kathrina HOWZE
<p>
<a name ="I072358"><b>[I072358]</b></a><br />
Kathrina Howze (Mrs. Robert L.) Maclellan , a member of a prominent Chattanooga family, went home to be with the Lord at her home on Lookout Mountain on Monday Sept. 26, 2011. She was 99. <br>
She was a devoted and loving wife, mother, grandmother, great-grandmother and faithful community leader. She was a woman of devout Christian faith, who served humbly and gave thanks to Jesus Christ. <br>
Mrs. Maclellan was preceded in death in 1971 by her husband, Robert Llewellyn Maclellan , chairman of the board and chief executive officer of Provident Life and Accident Insurance Co.; and in 1978 by her daughter, Anne Maclellan Munford. She was the daughter of the late Kathrina Richardson Howze and Gerald Howze, of Duluth, Minn. <br>
She was a graduate of Sweet Briar College and a resident of Lookout Mountain for over 70 years. She was an active and devoted member of the Lookout Mountain Presbyterian Church and served in several capacities on the Board of Women in Church since 1947. <br>
Mrs. Maclellan was an active contributor to her community and served on several boards as well as held membership in many different organizations. Several include: Daughters of the American Revolution, Junior League of Chattanooga, the National Society of Colonial Dames of America, Children's Home, YWCA, Team Evaluation Center and Review Club. She served on the boards of trustees of Senior Neighbors, Garden Club of Lookout Mountain, King College, Helen M. Tipton Charitable Trust, Christian Education Charitable Trust and the Maclellan Foundation Inc. <br>
She also served on the board of associates of Covenant College. <br>
After her husband's death, Mrs. Maclellan founded the Robert L. and Kathrina H. Maclellan Foundation. Many Chattanooga schools and charities are benefactors of this generous work. The foundation seeks to fulfill Bob's and her wish that their estates be used "for the benefit of our community and the needs of its people." Mrs. Maclellan sought to continue in the traditions of her husband and her own heart for building the Kingdom of Christ here in the greater Chattanooga area. <br>
In a Chattanooga Times article dated Jan. 13, 1971, Bill Casteel quoted Bob Maclellan as he spoke of his wife by saying, "She was always at my side, in good and bad times." She supported the work of her husband in attending Provident meetings and insurance association meetings. During World War II, she moved with her husband to Washington, D.C., where he was instrumental in establishing the National Service Insurance Co. that insured the lives then and now of our military. The work of Mrs. Maclellan and her legacy will continue on through the Robert L. and Kathrina H. Maclellan Foundation, but her presence and true Christian spirit will be greatly missed. <br>
She is survived by one son, Robert Howze "Scott" Maclellan and wife, Lisa; two granddaughters, Lara M. Munford and Heather H. Maclellan ; three grandsons Ian, Reid, and Lee Maclellan ; and five greatgrandchildren, Tyler, Haydon, Kyle, Landon and Lundon. <br>
