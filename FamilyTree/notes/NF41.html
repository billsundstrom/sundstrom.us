Sarah had another girl, born 5/30/1905.  I found no record of death, but assume she died before 1920.<br>

They may have had two addition children that both died young:<br>
There is a birth record for a girl born to Anna and Charles on 10/9/1893 in Bridgewater.<br>
There is a record of a death for a Florence, age 3 months, who died 11/14/1897.  This conflicts with the birth of Georgiana in February.  If 3 days old, then it would make sense.<br>

Love story remembered<br>
Fort Worth women heads dedication as French honor soldiers killed<br>
It would have been 55 years of marriage had a tragic accident not intervened with the Grashers.  <br>
 In 1949, after four months of courtship at the University of Michigan, Ruth and Howard K. Grasher were married. Last week, Ruth, a Fort Worth resident, was in France to dedicate a memorial to honor all Americans who died while serving at Evreux Fauville Air Base. As relatives of a solider killed, Ruth and her oldest child, Barbara, attended the dedication, but they were also chosen to signify the dedication of the memorial by placing a wreath on the granite monument. <br>
 On the anniversary of Howard's death 46 years later, Ruth tells of a love story and its tragic ending - a mid-air collision over France. Simply, she says, "he was the best looking human being I had ever seen."  <br>
 After they married, Howard taught marketing and salesmanship at the University of Nebraska in Lincoln. Within 10 months of marriage, their first-born, Barbara, joined them. Over the years, there would be four more children.  <br>
 While in Nebraska, Howard joined the Air National Guard. Ruth says he joined because Howard's students were joining, they were going to fly jets and he needed to earn extra money for his family. During World War II, Howard had been in the Army Air Corps, but never went overseas. <br>
 "It was in May 1950 when he joined the Guard and in June the Korean War started," she said. <br>
 The government then activated the Iowa and Nebraska Air National Guards and Howard completed one tour of duty in Korea. The family was then sent to Indiana for three years and Howard began teaching at the University of Indiana in ROTC. <br>
 In 1957, Howard was called upon, and he and his family were sent to the town of Evreux at Evreux-Fauville Air Base in France, northwest of Paris, with the 41st Troop Carrier Squadron. On Sept. 19, 1958, at 11:33 a.m., Howard<br>
was killed in a mid-air collision with a French jet, along with co-pilot 1st Lieutenant Elmer Eugene Faweett. The two men had been in the air at approximately 20,500 feet for one hour and four minutes flying a C-130A. <br>
 Ruth said Howard wasn't scheduled to fly that day. Another pilot had asked him to fly for him, and Howard graciously had accepted. <br>
 After the accident, American attorneys in Paris contacted Ruth saying they were looking into the crash and were contemplating suing the French government. Eventually a suit was filed and Ruth won the case and was awarded close to $190,000. In a letter, the French government wrote, "As a result of this accident, we have completely revised our flight testing procedure." <br>
 Ruth never re-married and raised her five children - Barbara, Jonathan, Christopher, Ellen and Martha. Ruth eventually earned a degree from the University of Texas at Arlington in sociology and then went on to TCU to earn a master's degree in education. <br>
 "My biggest accomplishment in work," she said, "was I founded a small, non-profit organization called Kids First where we did seminars for divorcing parents. I did that for about 10 years, then in January 2002 we merged with the Parenting Center." <br>
 That same year, Ruth was admitted to the hospital for 24 days because of a quadruple bypass surgery, a collapsed lung and ulcers. Today at 75, her health is better and her life is full of family and plenty of friends. <br>
