Capt. James Avery, the only child of Christopher, was born 1620. CametoAmerica with his father, and lived at Gloucester for several years. TheRev. Mr. Blinman, who had been minister of Gloucester for eight years,was engaged to become the minister of the Pequot Plantation. Aparty ofhis friends proposed to move with him, and came on to make preparatoryarrangements, Oct. 19, 1650. It appears that James Avery went back toGloucester sold his possession there to his father[Christopher], and in1651 returned to New London. In March of that year the principal body ofthese eastern families arrived. Capt. James acquired large tracts of landat what is now Poquonoc Bridge, Groton, east of New London. About 1656 hebuilt the hive of the Avery's at the head of Poquonoc Plain, a mile and ahalf from the river Thames. In 1684, the old Blinman edifice, firstchurch of New London, the unadorned church's and water-tower of thewilderness, which had stood for thirty years, was sold to Capt. Avery forsix pounds, with the condition that he should remove it in one month'stime. According to tradition, the church was taken down, it [sic]materials carried across the river, and added to the house he had alreadybuilt at Poquonoc. In spite of this analytic and synthetic process, theancient dwelling seemed to have retained some of its sacred character,for a century later it was occupied until July 21, 1894, when a sparkfrom a passing, locomotive ignited its well seasoned frame, and in ashort time only ancient chimney remained to mark the spot of thishistoric house of Eastern Connecticut. A few years later the chimney was,taken down, the grounds graded, and a tasteful monument was erected bythe descendants of James Avery. He was ensign, lieutenant and Captain ofthe New London companies and served throughout King Phillip's war incommand of forty Indians from Stonington, New London and Lyme. In 1676 hewas captain of one of the four companies which protected the frontier,and for twenty-three years an officer of the town, and twelve timesdeputy to the General Court, 1656-80; also assisting Judge in thePrerogative Court, and was most prominent in matters relating to thechurch, as references to him in such connections are numerous. He married1st Nov. 10 1643, Jonna Greenslade, born about 1622. She died after 1693.He married 2nd.Abigail (Ingraham) Chesebrough, widow of Joshua Holmes,July 4, 1698, #2 Holmes Family. He died April 18, 1700. His widow wasliving as late as 1714.<br />
-----------------------------<br />
James Avery was baptized at Wolborough, Devonshire (near Abbotskerswell) on Apr 22,1621, the son of Christopher Avery and Margaret (Abraham) Stevens Avery of Ipplepen, Co.Devonshire, England. Christopher Avery, along with his son James, migrated to Groton,CT about 1636. Christopher's wife (James' mother) Margaret never came to New England. In fact, she died in 1626, and Christopher Avery married Alice Berdon in 1630 in England. Christopher and James left Alice behind in England, never to return.<br />
All Averys in America descend from either this James Avery or from another Avery immigrant progenitor, William Avery of Dedham. It is not yet proven whether any relationship exists between the two Avery branches.<br />
His first wife was Joanna Greenslade Avery, married at Gloucester,MA on Nov 10,1643. His second wife was Abigail (Ingraham) Cheeseboro Holmes Avery, the widow of Samuel Cheeseboro and of Joshua Holmes, married July 4,1698. (Her marriage to James Avery was brief....she is buried under the name of Abigail Holmes.)<br />

LUTHER CLAPP, retired farmer ; P. O. Chatham Center. Among therepresentative farmers and self-made men of this township, is theabove-mentioned gentleman, who was born Jan. 20, 1813, in ChesterfieldTownship, Hampshire Co., Mass., son of Ira Clapp, who was born March 14,1783, and was a son of Amasa, whose great-grandfather was an Englishman,and came to this country three years subsequent to the landing of thePilgrim Fathers. From this gentleman and his brother, who came with him,have descended a numerous progeny. To Ira Clapp was born a family of fivechildren, three sons and two daughters, who are Levi and Luther, of thistownship ; Sophronia, Dorothy and Ira yet remain on the homestead inMassachusetts. The Clapp family are generally farmers as a class, and ofthe successful kind, to which vocation our subject was, in early life,quite thoroughly drilled, as well as in the fundamental rules of acommon-school education. Aug. 31, 1837, he was united in matrimony toHannah Jackson, who was born Feb. 25, 1818, in Northampton, Mass. ; shewas a daughter of. Benjamin and Electa (Miller) Benjamin, she being anative of England. Immediately after the marriage of Mr. Clapp, he cameWest, having, when he started, $300 in money, which he had earned priorto his marriage, working out by the month, which he invested upon hisarrival, buying one-half interest in his brother Levi's land and stockand tools, he having preceded him one year ; thus engaged in partnership,they continued in this relation for twelve years, at which time there wasa division, and each assumed absolute control over their own individualaffairs. To Mr. Clapp have been born four children, who are Caroline,since the wife of Jonathan Beach, of this township ; Ellen, now Mrs.Silas Moody, of Gratiot Co., Mich. ; Adelaide, Mrs. John B. Whitney, andDyer A., who now resides on the home farm, which consists of 235 acres.Mr. Clapp is now retired from active business, having been successful inhis career as a farmer and business man. Mr. Clapp's parents never cameto this country to settle, but died in Massachusetts, he Jan. 27, 1850,she Dec. 26, same year, and was, for many years, a member of theCongregational Church. Mr. Luther Clapp and wife, since the spring of1841. have been members of the same church as that of his parents. Hisfather's family were all very temperate, neither using intoxicatingliquors of any kind, or even tobacco, which example has since been everfollowed by his descendants, even down to his grandchildren. Although astanch and standard Republican, yet he has never craved publicity in theofficial relations of his township, and has declined all invitations topublic honors, and been content and best satisfied to remain in the quietwalks of life. His sound judgment and ripe experience in businessaffairs. and, pertaining to agricultural matters, are worthy of theemulation and practice of the rising generation. He is a liberal patronof the public journals, there being over a dozen of papers andperiodicals taken in his family. Has been a patron of the ClevelandLeader and New York Independent since their commencement.<br />

Acceded 856. Conquered York 866/7, Slayer Of St. Edmund Of East Anglia 869<br />
 <br />
They headquartered in Ireland and raided York on All Saints Day, 1 Nov 866.<br />
 <br />
Royal Families of Medieval Scandinavia places Ivar the Boneless, "participated in the martyrdom of St. Edmund in 869 in England . . . also took part in the siege of Dumbarton (in Scotland) in 870 . . . king of the Norsemen of all Ireland and Britain", as son of Ragnar. Rudolph Krutar, following a "classic" ancestry of Somerled, by the Clan MacDonald, has obviously the same Ivar/Ivarr as father of Guthorm probably King of Dublin, but with the following ancestry:<br />
1. Ivarr, King of Dublin; sacked Dunbarton in 870.<br />
2. King Godfrey; raided Ireland in 854, d. 873.<br />
4. King Ranald "Higher than the Hills"; expelled to Orkney.<br />
8. Olaf "Geirstada-Alf", King in Vestfold, 810-840 (in my files as Olaf Gudrodson, b. c790, d. 840)<br />
 <br />
 <br />
From Wikipedia<br />
 <br />
Ivar the Boneless (Ivar inn beinlausi) (c. 794 - 872 in Dublin) was the nickname of Ivar Ragnarsson. He was a Viking chieftain (and by reputation also a berserker), who, in 865 AD, with his brothers Halfdan Ragnarsson (Halfdene) and Ubbe Ragnarsson (Hubba), invaded the East Anglian region of England. An accommodation was quickly reached with the East Anglians. The following year, Ivar led his forces north on horseback and easily captured Jorvik (what the Danes called York) from the Northumbrians who were at that time engaged in a civil war.<br />
 <br />
Ivar is also attributed with the slaying of St Edmund of East Anglia in 869 AD.<br />
 <br />
There is some disagreement as to the meaning of Ivar's epithet "Boneless." Some have suggested it was a euphemism for impotence or even a snake metaphor (he had a brother named Snake-Eye). However, the Scandinavian sources describe a condition very similar to a form of osteogenesis imperfecta (see below).<br />
 <br />
Scandinavian sources<br />
Ivar Boneless was according to the saga of Ragnar Lodbrok, the eldest son of Ragnar and Kraka. He had only cartilage in his legs and so he could not walk, but had to be carried on a shield. However, it is said he was fair, big, strong and one of the wisest men who have ever lived. He was consequently the advisor of his brothers Björn Ironside, Sigurd Snake-Eye and Hvitserk.<br />
 <br />
When king Ælla of Northumberland had murdered their father by throwing him into a snake-pit, Ivar's brothers tried to avenge their father, but were beaten. Ivar then went to king Ælla and said that he sought reconciliation. He only asked for as much land as he could cover with an ox's hide and swore never to wage war against Ælla. Then Ivar cut the ox's hide into so fine strands that he could envelope a large fortress (in an older saga it was York and according to a younger saga it was London) which he could take as his own. As he was the most generous of men, he attracted a great many warriors, whom he consequently kept from Ælla when this king was attacked by Ivar's brothers for the second time.<br />
 <br />
Ælla was captured and when the brothers were to decide how to give Ælla his just punishment, Ivar suggested that they carve the "blood eagle" on his back. This meant that Ælla's back was cut open, the ribs pulled from his spine and his lungs removed. After justice had been served, Ivar became the king of England.<br />

Farmer opposed Amax to preserve land<br />
By RICK JILLSON, Warrick columnist<br />
October 22, 2004<br />
 <br />
In a barren pit due south of Elberfeld and west of Chandler, not too far from what remains of Millersburg, lies a mechanized carcass with "Amax" painted on the side of its rusted shovel. Like a sunken ship deemed too cumbersome and pointless to be raised, this massive artifact sits abandoned in a hole of its own making, a tangible reminder of a Warrick County history clouded with coal dust, leveled buildings and disrupted lives.<br />
"There used to be several churches and businesses out here," recalls Alan Fehd, who grew up on his late father Elmer Fehd's dairy farm about two miles southwest of Millersburg. Today Fehd and his wife, Val, live on a 14-acre parcel of beautifully wooded land across from Alan's boyhood home. "When I was a kid there was Horn's Garage. And Murphy's Machine Shop was a mile south," Fehd said. "And there was a general store in Millersburg and Elmer's Tavern, which plenty of folks can tell you stories about."<br />
Fehd went to school in Millersburg until the mid-1960s, when the Amax Ayrshire Mine reduced much of the town to a series of hills and pits. He finished high school in Chandler. Yet the mining wasn't limited to Millersburg. Amax trucks and shovels cut through thousands of acres throughout northeastern Warrick County, including Heim Road, west of Chandler, where Elmer Fehd once owned 40 acres of farmland.<br />
"Dad owned land down in the bottoms on Heim Road - right where the mining started," Fehd said. Elmer sold the mineral rights to his Heim Road acreage to a speculator shortly after the Great Depression, when money was scarce. The developer later sold those rights to Amax.<br />
What the elder Fehd refused to part with, though, was his 200-plus-acre Hoosier Homestead family farm. Along with three other neighboring families and a nearby church, he stubbornly refused to budge.<br />
"Basically they mined in a big horseshoe around us," Alan said with a smile. "Dad's philosophy was, he was a caretaker of the land, not the owner. I don't believe he ever regretted his decision (not to sell)."<br />
Right up until his passing in 1996, Elmer Fehd was more than a proud farmer who stood his ground. He was a watchdog who held Amax accountable while it was actively mining in the area (until the late 1980s), and during the reclamation process, which extended into the mid-'90s.<br />
"Dad was responsible for keeping a lot of the roads around here open and getting them re-opened," Fehd said. "He made sure (Amax) was accountable." When Alan built his home in 1992, reclamation work was still going on around him and very few people lived nearby.<br />
That began to change in 1997, when Tri-State developer Tom Newmaster bought 6,235 acres of former Ayrshire Mine land. A number of homes have popped up since on the property Newmaster bought, and many more lots are for sale. Houses, from middle-class models to more affluent designs, now dominate several of the once-desolate roads surrounding Alan and Val's land.<br />
All of this development leads one to wonder: Do these newcomers realize the significance of that rusted shovel at the intersection of St. John's and Gander roads? Do they understand and appreciate how hard Elmer Fehd and people like him worked to safeguard the land they now call home?<br />
"I guess I'd just as soon see it wild and undeveloped like it used to be," said Alan with a shrug. "But it's certainly better than seeing it developed commercially."<br />

Hans Heglin, Clay County Pioneer, Passes Away on Thursday of Last Week.<br />
 <br />
     Hans Heglin was born in Hogbo Parish, Sweden, August 19, 1826, and died at the home of his son, Fred Heglin, at Dalesburg, S.D. August 17, 1916, lacking just two days of being ninety years old.<br />
 <br />
     He was united in marriage to Brita Anderson in 1851, out of which union were born three sons and one daughter, namely John, Peter, and Frederick.  The daughter died in early infancy.  His wife died about three years ago.  John and Peter are residents of Saskatchewan, Canada, while Fred resides on the old homestead in Clay, S.D.  He is survived by a large number of grand and great grandchildren.  He emigrated from Sweden in 1869 and was destined for Galva, Illinois, but through some mistake was landed at Omaha instead, where he procured work the next day.  In this place he resided but a short time, moving to Council Bluffs where he remained until the fall of 1870 when he removed with his family to Dakota Territory.  At Sioux City he purchased an Ox team and finished the journey by means of the same.  He homesteaded in this country near Dalesburg which remained his home until the time of his death.<br />

     Grandpa Heglin, as he was familiarly known was a unique character. He was short of stature, but heavy set and had the power and endurance that was exceptional.  As a matter of interest it may be well to relate that during the early grasshopper times when want and penury knocked at every door in the land, he bade his wife goodbye and children goodbye and with knapsack on his shoulder and 50 cents in his pocket started for Omaha afoot, covering the entire distance during that day and night or in something less than twenty-four hours.  At the end of his journey he threw himself on the grass for a couple of hours of  refreshing sleep and waking, grasped the first job at hand and went to work the following day.  His habit of hard work continued through life and it was his delight to have one of the best cultivated gardens in the, even during his advanced years.  But he was as patient as he was enduring and this undoubtedly aided his tense vitality, for though at times afflicted by such distressing ills, such as quinsy, rheumatism and dropsy, and when others thought there was little hope he would rally and recover apparently coming out from the same a healthier and stronger man, and this was due perhaps to his sunny, hopeful disposition, for he was every whit an optimist.<br />
 <br />
     To the very last he could read a newspaper without glasses and his head did not contain a single gray hair.  But his optimism did not confine itself to his own personality.  It was contagious and extended to the whole community.  In those dark days when hope was well nigh and gone many said, "We cannot endure this longer," Grandpa Heglin would answer, "Yes, this may be bad, but it is so much better than the old country." Through this spirit of optimism he had a good word for everybody, whether present or absent.  Then he had the spirit of charity and no no one called for aid that did not receive it cheerfully.  The lowliest tramp would not leave his door hungry.  He was a lover of music and undoubtedly transmitted this quality to his children, some who have become very proficient in the same.  Even at the close of his career he delighted to sing for his freinds the hymns of his native land.  He was simple-hearted, faithful member of the Lutheran church at Dalesburg, having united with it at its organization in 1872.<br />
 <br />
     There comes to us with ever increasing force the thought that life is transitory; that the place that once knew us shall no us no more.  The old familiar faces that we once looked upon with tender interest, are now but vague images on memory's wall.  It is safe to say so far as Dalesburg is concerned that Grandpa Heglin was the last ripened sheaf to be garnered from the field; last of the elder ones who came here in the prime of his life.  May we not appropriately put the words of the post on the lips of the Master and hear him say as he applies it to human life.<br />
 <br />
"I'll not leave thee thou lone one,<br />
To pine on the stem,<br />
Since the lovely are sleeping,<br />
Go sleep thou with them.<br />
Thus kindly I'll scatter,<br />
Thy leaves o'er the bed,<br />
Where thy mates of the garden,<br />
Lie scattered and dead."<br />
 <br />
     It had been planned , and invitations sent out by those who tenderly and lovingly cared for this worthy father and citizen that they should appropriately celebrate his ninetieth anniversary, but the Master of Life thought otherwise.  Suddenly, from usual health, he grew ill on Tuesday at 6 p.m., and died Thursday at 4 p.m., thus became Saturday his ninetieth anniversary a day of sorrow and tears and loneliness to his loved ones and tender and tearful memory to all that Knew him.  His ashes were at the hands of  Pastor Ford, consigned to Mother Earth and he sleeps along side his beloved wife in the cemetery on the hill, awaiting the summons of the Lord of Life and Glory. Sleep in peace, neighbor, freind, sleep in peace.<br />

William Brewster was born about 1566, the son of William Brewster.  Hewas educated in both Greek and Latin and spent some time at CambridgeUniversity, although he never completed a full degree.  He went into theservice of William Davison, then Secretary of State, while his fatherback home maintained a position as the postmaster of Scrooby,Nottinghamshire.  Under Davison, Brewster first traveled to theNetherlands.  After Davison's departure as Secretary of State, Brewsterworked himself into his father's postmaster duties and maintained ScroobyManor.  Brewster was instrumental in establishing the small Separatistchurch with Richard Clyfton, and they often held their meetings in theManor house.  Brewster and the others were eventually found and forcedout, and fleeing prosecution and persecution they headed to Amsterdam in1608, and moving to Leiden, Holland in 1609.  Brewster became thechurch's Elder, responsible for seeing that the congregation's memberscarried themselves properly, both helping and admonishing them whennecessary.<br />
 <br />
In Leiden, Brewster working with Thomas Brewer became working a printing press and publishing religious books and pamphlets which were then illegally conveyed into England.  Brewster also employed himself teaching University of Leiden students English.  By 1618, the English authorities were onto him and his printing press, and had the Dutch authorities in pursuit of him.  Thomas Brewer was arrested and held in the University of Leiden's prison, but Brewster managed to evade the authorities and went into hiding for a couple years.<br />
 <br />
When the Leiden church congregation decided to send the first wave to set up and establish a colony that everyone could eventually move to, their pastor John Robinson decided to remain behind in Leiden with the majority of the congregation, intending to come later.  The smaller group that went on the Mayflower desired the next highest ranking church official, Elder Brewster, go with them; so he agreed.  He brought his wife Mary and two youngest children, Love and Wrestling, on the Mayflower with him.<br />
 <br />
Brewster continued his work as Church Elder throughout his life at Plymouth Colony.  His wife Mary died in 1627, and he never remarried.  He lived to be nearly 80 years old, dying in 1644.

The Reverend William Brewster (1567 - 1644), was a Pilgrim colonist leader who came from Scrooby, in north Nottinghamshire and reached the American colonies in the Mayflower in 1620, along with his wife, Mary Brewster, and his sons, Love Brewster and Wrestling Brewste<br />
 <br />
Origins<br />
Scrooby Manor was in the possession of the Archbishops of York. Brewster's father, William senior, had been the estate bailiff for the archbishop for fifteen years from around 1580. With this post went that of postmaster, which was a more important one than it might have been in another village, which had not been situated on the Great North Road as Scrooby then was.<br />
 <br />
William junior studied briefly at Peterhouse College in the University of Cambridge, before entering the service of William Davidson in 1584. In 1585, Davidson went to the Netherlands as an ambassador to the States-General. In 1586 he was appointed assistant to Queen Elizabeth's Secretary of State until Davidson lost the queen's favour in 1587.<br />
 <br />
Dissent<br />
Cambridge was a centre of thought concerning religious reformism but Brewster's time in the Netherlands in connection with Davidson's work, gave him opportunity to hear and see more of reformed religion. While, earlier in the sixteenth century, reformers had hoped to amend the Anglican church, by the end of it, many were looking toward splitting from it. (See Brownist).<br />
 <br />
On Davidson's disgrace, Brewster returned to Scrooby. There, from 1590 to 1607, he held the position of postmaster. As such he was responsible for the provision of stage horses for the mails. By the 1590s, Brewster's brother, James, was a rather rebellious Anglican priest, vicar of the parish of Sutton and Lound, in Nottinghamshire. From 1594, it fell to James to appoint curates to Scrooby church so that Brewster, James and leading members of the Scrooby congregation were brought before the ecclesiastical court for their dissent. They were set on a path of separation from the Anglican Church. From about 1602, Scrooby Manor, Brewster's home, became a meeting place for the dissenting Puritans. In 1606, they formed the Separatist Church of Scrooby.<br />
 <br />
Emigration<br />
Restrictions and pressures applied by the authorities convinced the congregation of a need to emigrate to the more sympathetic atmosphere of Holland but leaving England without permission was illegal at the time so that departure was a complex matter. On its first attempt, the group was arrested at Scotia Creek, in 1607 but Brewster and others left from The Humber in 1608. In 1609, he was selected as ruling elder of the congregation.<br />
 <br />
In Leiden, the group managed to make a living. Brewster taught English and later, printed and published religious books for sale in England, though they were proscribed there. In 1619, the printing type was seized by the authorities under pressure from the English ambassador and Brewster's partner was arrested. Brewster escaped and, with the help of Robert Cushman, obtained a land patent from the London Virginia Company on behalf of himself and his colleagues.<br />
 <br />
In 1620 he joined the first group of Pilgrims aboard the Mayflower on the voyage to North America. When the colonists landed at Plymouth, Brewster became the senior elder of the colony, serving as its religious leader and as an advisor to Governor William Bradford. Brewster took the part of the colony's religious leader until a pastor, Ralph Smith arrived in 1629. Thereafter he continued to preach until his death in April 1644.<br />
 <br />
Descendants<br />
There are many notable descendants of William Brewster including William Howard Taft, Zachary Taylor, Roger Nash Baldwin, and Katharine Hepburn.[Caulkins.FTW]<br />

Jean Ier of Preuilly (1110 ? 1182) Count de Vendôme (1145-1182), son of Geoffroy III Grisegonel and Mathilde de Châteaudun. He governed their estates after the departure of his father in crusades in 1137.  He became the count when died during his return from the Holy Land.<br />
Vendôme was under the control Fulk Oison, the Count of Anjou. It ended up being transmitted to king Henri II Plantagenêt, Jean I found himself allied with the English against the King Louis VII.<br />
In 1161 Thibaut IV, Count de Blois, seized the town of Vendôme, badly beaten, and besieged castle. But the resistance of the Count Jean I and his sons Bouchard and Lancelin defeated the Count of Blois. The Count of Anjou was obliged to restore their power. In 1170, Vendôme is where the kings of France and England met and negotiated a truce.<br />
In 1173, Henri II fought with his sons. This conflict broke up the family of Vendôme, because Jean I supported the father, and Bouchard supported the princes. Bouchard occupied by force the castle and barred the city gates to his father. But the young English princes were beaten and Bouchard had to submit to his father.<br />
The old conflict with the abbey of the Trinity reemerged in 1176. He drove the monks out and they took refuge in Angers. Excommunicated, he was forced to fight in the Holy Land. On his return he died, in 1182 at the Charity-on-Loire.<br />

The English origins of Mrs. Mary Brewster are not known.  A number oftheories have been proposed over the years, including maiden names suchas Wentworth, Love, Wyrall, and others.  However, no proof to support anyof these theories has been found.<br />
 <br />
We know that Mary was born about 1569, because she stated she was 40 years old in an affidavit filed in Leiden, Holland on 25 June 1609.  She was presumably from the vicinity of Doncaster, Yorkshire or Scrooby, Nottinghamshire, as she married William Brewster there about 1592 and had their first son Jonathan born there a year later.  She next had a daughter Patience, born about 1600 or somewhat earlier.  About 1606, the church congregation began more formally meeting at the Scrooby manor, where she and husband William resided.  About this time, pressure from the English authorities was mounting, and the meetings became more and more secretive.  She gave birth to another daughter at this time, which they named Fear.  The couple fled just over a year later for Holland with the other members of the congregation, and in Leiden they buried an unnamed child: presumably one that had died in infancy.  In 1611, she gave birth to a son they named Love, and two or three years later gave birth to their last son, which they named Wrestling.<br />
 <br />
Mary came to Plymouth on the Mayflower in 1620 with husband William, and her two youngest children Love and Wrestling.  Mary was one of only five adult women to survive the first winter, and one of only four women to survive to the so-called "first" Thanksgiving in 1621.  Son Jonathan Brewster joined the family in November 1621, arriving at Plymouth on the ship Fortune.  Daughters Patience and Fear came on the ship Anne in 1623.  Mary died in 1627 at Plymouth, having reached about the age of 60.  Husband William survived her, and would live another 17 years before he died.[Caulkins.FTW]<br />

Elder Jonathan Brewster (August 12, 1593 - August 7, 1659) was an earlyAmerican settler, the son and eldest child of elder William Brewster  andhis wife, Mary. Brewster had two younger sisters, Patience and Fear, andtwo younger brothers, Love and Wrestling along with an unnamed brotherwho died young.<br />
Brewster was born in Scrooby, Nottinghamshire, on August 12, 1593. In around 1610, he accompanied his family to Leiden in Holland, where he married his first wife.[2]  Brewster did not join his family on the Mayflower  in 1620, however.

Otto or Oddo (died 30 November 912) was a Saxon nobleman; by laterauthors, he is often called Otto the Illustrious. The younger son ofLiudolf, Duke of Saxony and his wife Oda, Otto presumably became duke ofSaxony shortly before his death, but no details are known.<br />
 <br />
According to Widukind of Corvey, Otto was offered the kingship of the East Franconian Kingdom in 911 and did not accept it, but the truthfulness of this report is considered doubtful. Otto's wife was Hathui, daughter of Henry, Duke of Austria. He is named as count of South Thuringia in 888, and as count of the Eichsfeld in 908; he was also lay abbot of the Monastery of Hersfeld. Otto is buried in the monastery church of Gandersheim. His son Henry, later to be King Henry the Fowler, succeeded him as duke of Saxony.<br />

Hilarion T. "Doc" Welter, age 90, a life-long Crookston, Minnesotaresident, died peacefully at the home of his daughter, Mona Heglin , inSurprise, Arizona.<br />
Doc was going to be spending the winter there and his passing was unexpected.<br />
He was born in Crookston on July 27, 1920, and was the son of Nicholas and Catherine (Averbeck) Welter. He was baptized and confirmed in the Catholic faith and graduated from the Cathedral High School in 1939. On May 6, 1941 Doc was united in marriage to Lauretta C. Cournia in Crookston.<br />
Together, they would raise two daughters and a son: Mona , Jerry, and Joyce. Early in their marriage they moved with their firstborn, Mona , to Superior, Wisconsin while Doc worked in the shipyard there for a few years in support of the war effort. After returning to Crookston he was employed as a plumber, and then in July of 1951 joined the Crookston Fire Department.<br />
He was named Fire Chief in the Spring of 1961 and held that position until his retirement from the Department in 1983. Doc and Lauretta enjoyed traveling and spent 18 winters in Texas. Sadly, Lauretta passed away on August 14, 2005.<br />
Doc was a lifelong member of the Cathedral of the Immaculate Conception, and also held membership in the Knights of Columbus and Crookston Eagles Aerie #873.<br />
He liked to do woodworking, and was an avid model-railroader.<br />
Doc spent many, many hours working on the railroad display he set up in his basement.<br />
It was his pride and joy and he enjoyed showing it off to visitors, and to fellow members of the Northern Lights Railroad Club he belonged to in East Grand Forks. Over the years Doc spent lots of time pulling his kids around the lake on water-skis; and being with them was his greatest joy.<br />
His family is grateful to have been able to share in his life for so many years, and they will cherish many wonderful memories of a great husband, dad, grandpa, and great grandpa.<br />
Loving family members include his 3 children: Mona (Ron) Heglin of Surprise, AZ, Jerry (LaVonne) Welter of Kirkhoven, MN, and Joyce (Pete) Habben of East Grand Forks, MN; 6 grandchildren: Michael, Kim, Stacy, Lisa, Mark, and Chris; and 13 great grandchildren.<br />

From Wikipedia<br />
 <br />
Henry I, the Fowler (German: Heinrich der Vogler) (876 - July 2, 936), was Duke of Saxony from 912 and king of the Germans from 919 until his death in 936. First of the Ottonian Dynasty of German kings and emperors, he is generally considered to be the founder and first king of the medieval German Empire, known until then as the East Franconian Kingdom. An avid hunter, he obtained the epithet "the Fowler" because he was allegedly fixing his birding nets when messengers arrived to inform him that he was to be king.<br />
 <br />
Henry was the son of Otto the Illustrious, duke of Saxony, and his wife Hedwiga, a great-granddaughter of Charlemagne. In 906 he married Hatheburg, daughter of the Saxon count Erwin, but divorced her in 909 after she had given birth to his son Thankmar. Later that year he married Matilda of Ringelheim, daughter of Dietrich, count in western Saxony (Westfalia). Matilda bore him three sons and two daughters and founded many religious institutions, including the abbey of Quedlinburg where Henry is buried, and was later canonized.<br />
 <br />
Henry became duke of Saxony upon his father's death in 912 and, an able ruler, continued to strengthen Saxony, frequently in conflict with his neighbors to the South, the dukes of Franconia.<br />
 <br />
In 918 king Conrad I of the East-Franconian Empire, and duke of Franconia, died and recommended Henry as his successor as king, despite the fact that they had been at odds with each other from 912 to 915 over the title to lands in Thuringia. Conrad's choice was conveyed by duke Eberhard III of Franconia, Conrad's bother and heir, to the assembled Franconian and Saxon nobles at the Reichstag of Fritzlar in 919, which duly elected Henry to be king. Henry however was not anointed, the only king of his time not to undergo that rite. Duke Burkhard I of Swabia soon swore fealty to the new king, but duke Arnulf of Bavaria did not submit until Henry invaded Bavaria in 921 and Arnulf swore fealty to him.<br />
 <br />
Henry regarded the kingdom as a confederation of tribal duchies rather than a feudal kingdom and himself as primus inter pares. Rather than seeking to administer the empire through counts, as Charlemagne had done and his successors had attempted, Henry allowed the dukes of Franconia, Swabia and Bavaria to maintain complete internal control of their holdings. In 925, he defeated Giselbert, duke of Lotharingia (Lorraine), and brought that realm, which had been lost in 910, back into the German kingdom as the fifth tribal duchy (the others being Saxony, Franconia, Swabia, and Bavaria), but allowing Giselbert to remain in power and marrying his daughter Gerberga to his new vassal in 928.<br />
 <br />
Henry was a very able military leader. Germany had been repeatedly raided by the Magyars (Hungarians), and in 924 Henry paid them a tribute to secure a ten-year truce so that he could fortify towns and train a new elite cavalry force. With his new army, he conquered the Havelli and the Daleminzi in 928 and put down a rebellion in Bohemia in 929. When the Magyars began raiding again, he led an army of all German tribes to victory over them at the battle of Riade in 933, stopping one of their advances into Germany. He also pacified territories to the north, where the Danes had harried the Frisians off to the sea. The monk and historian Widukind of Corvey in his Rex gestae Saxonicae reports that the Danes were subjects of Henry the Fowler. Henry incorporated territories held by the Wends, who together with the Danes had attacked Germany, into his kingdom and also conquered Schleswig in 934.<br />
 <br />
When Henry died on 2 July 936, all German tribes were united in a single kingdom. Henry I is therefore considered the first German king and the founder of the eventual Holy Roman Empire of the German Nation (Heiliges Römisches Reich Deutscher Nation).<br />
 <br />
His son Otto succeeded him as Emperor Otto I ("the Great"). His second son, Henry, became duke of Bavaria. A third son, Brun (or Bruno), became archbishop of Cologne. His son from his first marriage, Thankmar, rebelled against his half-brother Otto and was killed in battle in 936. His daughter Gerberga married Duke Giselbert of Lorraine and subsequently King Louis IV of France. His youngest daughter Hedwige of Saxony married Duke (Hugh the Great) of France and was the mother of Hugh Capet, the first Capetian king of France.<br />

From Wikipedia,<br />
Count Floris III of Holland ( 1141 - August 1, 1190) was Count of Holland from 1157 to his death, succeeding his father, Dirk VI.<br />
 <br />
On September 28, 1162 he married Ada, sister of king William I of Scotland, also known as William the Lion. The county of Holland adopted from him the rampant lion in the coat of arms and the name of William.<br />
 <br />
Floris III was a loyal vassal to Frederick I Barbarossa. He accompanied the emperor on two expeditions to Italy in 1158 and 1176-1178.<br />
 <br />
The emperor gave Floris the toll right of Geervliet, the most important toll station in Holland at that time. This was actually the legalisation of an existing situation, because the counts of Holland had charged tolls illegally since the start of the 11th century.<br />
 <br />
During his reign Floris III had troubles with West-Friesland and a war with Philip count of Flanders concerning their respective rights in West Zeeland, in which he was beaten. In 1170 a great flood caused immense devastation in the north and helped to form the Zuider Zee.<br />
 <br />
In 1189 Floris accompanied Frederick Barbarossa upon the third Crusade, of which he was a distinguished leader. He died in 1190 at Antioch of pestilence and was buried there.<br />
 <br />
Two sons of Floris III became count of Holland: Dirk VII in 1190 and William I in 1203.<br />

From Wikipedia<br />
 <br />
Coenwulf (or Cenwulf) (died 821) was King of Mercia from 796 to 821.<br />
 <br />
Coenwulf became king after the death of Ecgfrith, the son of Offa, in December 796; given the very brief duration of Ecgfrith's rule (five months), it is possible that he was killed by Coenwulf, who subsequently became king despite the fact that his only claim to the throne was his descent from Cenwalh, an obscure younger brother of the past kings Penda and Eowa, who had lived 150 years earlier.<br />
 <br />
Kent, which had been ruled as a Mercian territory since 785, rose in rebellion in 796. Coenwulf won the Church's backing for a reconquest of Kent, in large part due to its dissatisfaction with the exile of the pro-Mercian Archbishop of Canterbury, Aethelheard, who fled in the face of the rebellion. In 798, Coenwulf invaded Kent, deposed and captured the rebel king Eadbert Praen, and made his own brother Cuthred king of Kent. Cuthred reigned in Kent from 798 to 807; when he died, Coenwulf took control of Kent in name as well as fact.<br />
 <br />
Similar events took place in 796 in East Anglia (ruled directly by Mercia since 794), where Eadwald became king after a rebellion in the wake of Offa's death. However, Coenwulf regained control of East Anglia within a few years.<br />
 <br />
Throughout his reign, Coenwulf waged war against the Welsh of Powys and Gwynedd; in 798, the ruler of Gwynedd, Caradog ap Meirion was killed, probably in battle against the Mercians. Further campaigns against the Welsh are recorded in 816 and 818.<br />
 <br />
In 799, Coenwulf entered into a peace treaty with the West Saxons under Beorhtric, who had been installed as King of Wessex by Offa in 786; Beorhtric remained friendly to Mercian interests until his death in 802, when the less submissive Egbert became king. Coenwulf may have instigated the failed raid into Wessex of Ælthelmund, earl of the Hwicce, upon the accession of Egbert. However, the major conflict that established the supremacy of Wessex at the expense of Mercia would not occur until the 820s, after Coenwulf's death.<br />
 <br />
In 801, Mercia was invaded by Eardwulf of Northumbria, but peace was made between the two sides.<br />
 <br />
It was during Coenwulf's reign that the archbishopric of Litchfield was abolished, probably before 803, as the Hygeberht who signed as an abbot at the council of Cloveshoe in that year was presumably the former archbishop. Coenwulf appears from the charters to have quarrelled with Wulfred of Canterbury, who was consecrated in 806, and the dispute continued for several years. It was probably only settled at Cloveshoe in 825, when the lawsuit of the daughter and heiress of Coenwulf, Cwoenthryth, against Wulfred was terminated.<br />
 <br />
Coenwulf died in 821, and was succeeded by his brother Ceolwulf I.<br />

Cyrus M. Kingsley<br />
a native of the old "Bay State," was born in Hampshire county, March 8th, 1831. His ancestors date their lineage back to the pilgrim fathers.

Coming to Port Jervis he worked at his trade until June, 1852, then came west, arriving at St. Paul in September of that year, thence to Traverse des Sioux, where he passed the winter. During the spring of 1853 he was engaged in the construction of the old "Dodd" road, for which service it happens he never received his pay. Returning to St. Paul, he worked in the sash and door factory until winter, then entered a foundry. Mr. Kingsley constructed the first foundry buildings in that city. In 1868 he made a claim in section 8, where he has since lived, now having one of the prettiest homes and finest improved estates in the county.

FRED HEGLIN.<br />
Many of the well-to-do and progressive farmers of South Dakota are natives of Sweden and to this class belongs Fred Heglin, of Clay county, a member of the state legislature, who was born in Sweden in 1859 of the marriage of Hans and Brita (Anderson) Hoglund. Both parents were born in that country and the father followed farming there. Upon his emigration to America he went to Council Bluffs, Iowa, where he resided for a year, after which he came to South Dakota, taking up as a homestead the farm which is now in possession of his son Fred. The claim comprised one hundred and sixty acres, but Mr. Heglin added four hundred acres to it and became recognized as one of the energetic and successful farmers of the county. When he first came to the state, however, he was in straightened circumstances and after filing upon his homestead left his family thereon and walked to Omaha, a distance of some two hundred miles, in search of work, as there was at that time no opportunity to make a living for his family in this state, which was a wild and unsettled region. He left home with but fifty cents in his pocket and the long journey, which he made on foot is an indication of his determination and strength of will. He is still living at the advanced age of eighty-nine years and is in excellent health. His wife died in 1913. To them were born three sons: John and Peter H., who are farming in Canada; and Fred, of this review.<br />
The last named was nine years of age when he accompanied his parents to this country and had attended school in his native land. He continued his education in the public schools of Council Bluffs, Iowa, and although quite naturally he knew no English upon entering school there, in three months he was far ahead of some in his classes. When eighteen years of age he entered the high school at Yankton, South Dakota, where he was a student until he was twenty-two years old. He then returned home and in connection with his brothers operated the farm. However, as his brothers were working for others, the greater part of the responsibility of the work of the homestead devolved upon him. In 1890 his father retired from active life and he assumed entire charge of the place. In 1894 he was elected county auditor and held that office for two terms. During that time he rented his farm and after the expiration of his second term accepted a position in the Clay County Bank, where he remained for one year. He then returned to the farm and resumed its operation. In 1912 he was elected a member of the state legislature and is at present serving his second term. He had the honor of delivering the speech nominating for United States senator Dean Sterling, who was later elected.<br />
Mr. Heglin was married August 17, 1889, to Miss Elizabeth Ostlund, a native of Sweden, who accompanied her parents to the United States in 1868. Her father took up a homestead in Clay county but subsequently returned to Sweden, where he is now living retired. His wife died in 1890. To Mr. and Mrs. Heglin have been born the following children: Edna, who is now at home but was formerly a student in the University of South Dakota, making a special study of music; Judith, a graduate of the high school of Vermillion, who is fitting herself for a teacher; Herbert, who is a high-school student; and Wallace, who is attending the district school.<br />
Mr. Heglin was formerly a populist but now gives his political allegiance to the Republican Party. He has held various local offices and has always taken an active interest in township and school affairs. His religious faith is that of the Lutheran church and he is a deacon in the local organization of that denomination. He has added one hundred acres to the two hundred acres of land owned by his father and the farm is one of the best developed in the county, yielding a good financial return annually. In early manhood Mr. Heglin took up the study of music and organized the Dalesburg Band, which played at a number of state fairs. He was the leader of this band from its organization in 1887 until 1903 and under his direction it became a musical organization of merit. For thirty years he has been the choir leader in the Lutheran church and in many ways has contributed to the musical development of his locality. He is a man of broad views and of well-balanced personality and gives his support to all movements that have as their object the material, moral or intellectual development of his part of the state.<br />

THOMAS MINER / MINOR was born in Chew Magna, county of Somerset, Englandon 23 April 1608, son of Clement Miner. He emigrated to Massachusetts,USA perhaps in 1629 on the Lyon's Whelp as Banks 9  states or maybe acouple of years later on the Arabella as many older writings claim, allapparently without any real proof. The first reference to Thomas is inthe formation record of Congregational Church of Charlestown,Massachusetts dated 2 November 1632 (Ch ChR). That record refers to himand the others listed as dismissed from the Boston Church on Oct 14, 1632.<br />
Thomas Miner married Grace PALMER on 23 April 1634 in Massachusetts. She was born about 1612, the daughter of Walter Palmer of Charlestown. Their first child, John, was born in Charlestown, and then in 1636 they moved to Hingham, MA where more children were born.<br />
In 1645, they joined John Winthrop Jr. and company in the settlement of New London, CT. On 15 Oct 1652 Thomas sold his home lot in New London located at the head of Close Cove and settled in Stonington, CT with William Chesebrough, Thomas Stanton, and his father-in-law, Walter Palmer. The Stonington Historical Society has more information on the settling of the town. There is a monument to these founders (dedicated 31 August 1899) located in the Wequetequock Cemetery with one side dedicated to Thomas.<br />
In 1653 he bought some land from Cary Latham and moved from the Wequetequock area to the west side of the mouth of Quiambaug Cove near Mystic, CT and began one of the few diaries to survive from this period. This diary covers the period from 1653 through 1684 and was published as a book11 in 1899.<br />
He was among those who began the church at Stonington in June 1674. He was active in the affairs in both New London and Stonington and held many public service positions of trust and honor including deputy to the Connecticut General Court.<br />
He is the Thomas Miner who wrote back to England about 1683/4 and received a essay which explores the Miner versus Minor spelling of the name and traces the Miner ancestry back to the 1300s. The information in this document including the coat of arms it presents are believed to be false. After receiving this document, many his descendants generally used the Miner spelling of the name although some retained the Minor spelling especially his son John of Woodbury, CT.<br />
He died in Stonington, CT on 23 October 1690, and his wife died there on 31 December 1690. Both are buried at Stonington in the Wequetequock Cemetery under a prone, inscribed granite slab which reads "HERE LYES THE BODY OF LIUTENANT THOMAS MINOR AGED 83 -- DEPARTED 1690" and on the other side "HIS WIFE 1608 GRACE PALMER 1690" To get to Wequetequock Cemetery take Route 1, east from Stonington, CT or west from Pawcatuck, CT. When you reach the head of the cove, at the stop light, turn south on to Greenhaven Road, then take an immediate right onto Palmer Road. The cemetery is on your left.<br />

Viborg Car Accident Kills Two Teenagers<br />
A Friday morning car crash that happened just north of Viborg killed the two high school students.<br />
The accident happened just after 8:00 Friday morning. Officials say two cars collided at the intersection of 454th Ave and 289th Street in rural Viborg. Now a family and community is mourning the loss of two young girls.<br />
The two girls were on their way to school when the accident happened. Authorities say one vehicle was driving south on 454th avenue when it failed to yield and collided with a vehicle traveling west on 289th street.<br />
"Yield signs are there for a reason. For safety of people. Yield signs mean you're supposed to yield to oncoming traffic. You're not supposed to hurry to get through the intersection because it doesn't mean to stop because it does mean to stop," said Turner County Sheriff Byron Nogelmeier.<br />
Officials in Turner County say 16-year old Tatum Lockwood and 14-year old Deidre Lockwood both died - both sisters. Authorities say the man driving the pick up truck, 40 year old Curtis Hora of Irene was not injured.<br />
Authorities say a white pick up truck and a white station wagon were both involved in the accident. Authorities are still investigating and reconstructing the accident but say the collision did cause one vehicle to roll and the other landed in a field.<br />
Authorities say it is unclear how fast both vehicles were traveling when they hit but say the speed limit on township gravel and country gravel roads is 55 miles per hour.<br />
Sheriff Nogelmeier said, "55 mph If everyone's going that speed it can create quite a collision."<br />

Liudolf (died 12 March 864 or 866) was a Saxon count; later authorscalled him duke of the Eastern Saxons. He was also named as count ofEastphalia. Liudolf had possessions in eastern Saxony, and was involvedin wars against Normans and Slavs. The Liudolfing House, also known asthe Ottonian House, is named after him; he is its oldest known member.<br />
 <br />
Liudolf married Oda, daughter of a Frankish prince named Billung and his wife Aeda. Oda died on 17 May 913, supposedly at the age of 107. By marrying a Frankish nobleman's daughter, Liudolf followed suggestions set forth by Charlemagne about ensuring the integrity of the Frankish Kingdom through marriage.<br />
 <br />
In 845/846, Liudolf and his wife traveled to Rome in order to ask Pope Sergius II for support for the founding of a nunnery. The nunnery was founded in Brunshausen around 852, and it was moved to nearby Gandersheim in 881. Liudolf's daughter Hathumod became its first abbess. Liudolf is buried in Brunshausen; his sons Brun and Otto apparently inherited his property.<br />

On Oct. 28, 2005, Tatum Lockwood, 16, and her younger sister Deidre, 14,were killed in an automobile accident on their way to school in Viborg.<br />
One year later, their mother Wendy Lieberg decided that the anniversary of their death should not be one of despair, but one of hope. With that in mind, she organized the "Angels of Hope" tribute concert, which will be Saturday night in the Viborg School Gym --- the very same place the funeral service for the two girls was held one year earlier.<br />
The concert is meant to be a message of hope.<br />
"This evening is meant to remind us that every day is a gift. There is hope for any situation that confronts us in our life's journey," says Lieberg, who is an Aberdeen native.<br />
Tatum was a junior at Viborg High School and was involved in volleyball, basketball and on the student council. She was described as a "social butterfly" who made friends easily.<br />
Deidre was a freshman at Viborg and was also involved in volleyball and basketball. She was a Packers fan and loved her close-knit group of friends.<br />
Lieberg, 41, her brother Kelly of Sioux Falls and her sister Lora (Schanzenbach) of Aberdeen, are graduates of Roncalli High School. Wendy is the daughter of Sharon Lieberg of Aberdeen and the late Bruce Lieberg.<br />
Tatum and Deidre's father is David Lockwood of Viborg. Their older sister, Lindsey, is a sophomore at South Dakota State University in Brookings.<br />
Three bands will be featured on Saturday night. FROG (Friends Rejoicing Over God) will begin playing at 6 p.m. while food is served. Then Menno-based Sons of Thunder and the headline band, Bread of Stone of Sioux City, Iowa, will play. Both bands performed at the Eternal Rescue Outdoor Music Festival in Yankton. Bread of Stone has also played at the Lifelight festival in Sioux Falls.<br />
Jared Wockenfuss of Dallas, Texas, a former Yankton youth pastor and motivational speaker, will present "Every Day Is A Gift."<br />
There is no admission charge for the concert or refreshment, but a freewill offering will be taken. T-shirts will be sold for $10 to help offset expenses. Any proceeds will go to Christian youth organizations such as FROG and Camp Judson, where Tatum, Deidre and their sister Lindsey had attended church camp.<br />

From the notes below there appears to be a difference of opinion aboutwhen Gwaithfoed lived. Harold died 1066 (of course), which fits withGwaithfoed's death date of 1057. But Edgar lived from 943 to 975, so ifhe was contemporary with both, he lived a long and prosperous life,marrying both early and very late in life.<br />
 <br />
Gwaethfoed, Lord of Cardigan and Gwynfai (d 1057), lived in the time of Harold the Saxon; m. Morfydd, dau. of Ivor (or Ynyr), King of Gwent, and one of his heirs. [Annals and Antiquities of Wales II:208]<br />
 <br />
______________________<br />
 <br />
Gwaethvoed was contemporary with Edgar, king of Saxons, and was, in conformity with the vassalage of those periods, summoned, with other Welsh chieftains, by Edgar, to meet him at Chester, to row him, in his royal barge, on the river Dee, in proof of his fealty. Gwaethvoed, in answer to his summons, said he could not row, and that he would not, if he could, except it were to save a person's life, whether king or vassal. Edgar sent a second and very imperious message, which Gwaethvoed did not seem at all to notice, until the messenger begged to know what reply he should deliver to the king; when Gwaethevoed, in the Welsh language, answered thus: 'Say to him, fear him who fears not death.: This stern reply, discovering at once to Edgar the fearless unbending character he had to deal with, he prudently changed his autocratic decree into a desire of mutual friendship, and going to Gwaethvoed, gave the chief his hand in pledge of his sincerity. Gwaethvoed married Morfydd, one of the daughters and co-heirs of Ivor, king or lord of Gwent. [Burke's Commoners III:387]<br />

The ancestry is a little confused at this point. Apparently 'Ancestors ofEvelyn Wood Keeler', indicated below agrees with the way I have it, withClodien marrying Morfydd verch Owain. but the 'Annals & Antiquities ofWales' has Morfydd, born about the same time, marrying Clodien's father,Gwrydr, and was thus not Gwaithfoed's mother, but his grandmother. Sincethe latter would make Gwaithfoed born much later, this scheme goeshand-in-hand with Gwaithfoed living more contemporaneously with Haroldthan with Edgar of England. (see notes under Gwaithfoed). I have tried tomuddle through supporting both an early and late Gwaithfoed, so I amleaving Morfydd as married to Clodien.<br />

Joseph Roote<br />
  He married Hannah Haines in Northampton, Hampshire, Ma., 30 Dec 1660. Hannah was born in Springfield, Hampden, Ma., about 1641. Hannah was the daughter of Edmund Haines and Hannah Lambe. Hannah died 28 Jan 1691 in Northampton, Hampshire, Ma., at 49 years of age. Hannah's name has also been spelled "Haynes". He secondly married Mary Holton, daughter of William Holton (b. 20 Oct 1610) and Mary (b. Nov 1691), bet 1690/1692. Born ca 1636. Died on 16 Dec 1713 in Northfield, Franklin, MA.<br />
 <br />
  Joseph went to Northampton with his father, arriving there in 1654/55. His first home lot was along the east side of King Street, only about 2 acres in size. Since every settler was entitled to 4 acres, an additional 2 acres was granted, on the west side of the street for all the settlers except Joseph. This may have been because of his age (about 16 at that time), or because he was unmarried.<br />
 <br />
  In March of 1657/58, the town decided to apportion some land in the meadows, and lots were to be cast by those petitioners. Joseph Root drew 1 1/4 acres, adjoining Robert Hayward, John Stebbins 4 acres, Arthur Williams 5 acres, and Joseph Janes 1 acre & 1 rod.<br />
(Due to the paucity of land that he owned, his name does not appear on the list of contributers to the cause of attracting a minister, although he had voted in favor of doing so.)<br />
 <br />
  When the town performed an inventory (about 1663), in an attempt to settle disputed lines between properties, Joseph Root was shown as having only his 2 acre home lot plus 10 acres of meadow land.<br />

Ashland Daily Tidings, 23 December 2004<br />
By Vickie Aldous<br />
Astronauts first walked on the moon just six years before Don Laws was elected to the Ashland City Council.<br />
Laws gives way to new order:<br />
Southern Oregon University students who have already graduated and settled into their careers hadn't even been born, and Ashland was still navigating the change from mill town to tourist Mecca.<br />
Laws took office in 1975 and served almost continuously until his last council meeting on Tuesday. He had a short break after losing a a bid for mayor against Cathy Shaw in 1988, but was back on the council in 1990.<br />
Jack Hardesty defeated Laws in the November election and will take office in January.<br />
Throughout his time on the council, Laws listened to community members and sought solutions to Ashland's problems, according to former Councilor Susan Reid, who was elected in 1982 and worked beside Laws through 2002.<br />
"He took his role of listening to the community very seriously," Reid said. "He has always worked to try and fix a need in the community. He didn't come with an agenda as far as I could tell. He came with the attitude of, 'How can I help facilitate your ideas?'"<br />
Leaving a legacy:<br />
Many of Laws' achievements benefited the elders and youths of the community.<br />
"Don has always worked very hard on senior issues and to maintain the ability of seniors and people on fixed incomes to continue living here," Reid said.<br />
He was one of the key founders of the senior center on Homes Avenue.<br />
As a political science professor at SOU, Laws provided a direct link between the city government and the university, and stayed attuned to the needs of students.<br />
He worked to cut bus fares to a quarter in a move that benefited students while reducing traffic and air pollution. The council later agreed to increase its subsidies for bus transportation so that all trips inside Ashland are free - resulting in a doubling of ridership.<br />
With Reid, Laws advocated abandoning a sewage treatment plan that would have led to treated wastewater being sprayed on a hillside north of Ashland. After fierce debates, a slim council majority voted to treat the wastewater to higher standards and continue emptying it into Bear Creek for the benefit of fish.<br />
"The effluent made up at times one-third to one-half of the water in Bear Creek," Laws said. "I thought that was pretty important."<br />
A changing city:<br />
Laws also worked on the Comprehensive Plan, a behind-the-scenes, laborious task that yielded a blueprint to guide Ashland's growth and development.<br />
Looking back, Laws said the plan has helped make Ashland the beautiful town that it is today - creating a new set of problems.<br />
"The improvements have made the city so attractive it's changing the nature of the city," he said, pointing to continuing pressure for growth as well as the lack of affordable housing.<br />
Because of the millions of dollars it would cost to provide adequate affordable housing, residents may have to accept the fact that Ashland is changing and will not be able to attract many low and moderate-income families, he said.<br />
Meanwhile, growth is continuing at a pace that has some fearing Ashland will lose its small town character.<br />
"We'll have to work to make Ashland the best small city we can instead of the best small town," Laws said. "If we can't keep it a small town, let's make it the best small city in the world."<br />
A changing council:<br />
Laws impatience with the slow pace of the council has shown through in recent years.<br />
According to Oregon Shakespeare Festival Executive Director Paul Nicholson, Laws has exhibited integrity, a sense of humor, thoughtfulness and prudence. He respects process, but also knows that action moves the city forward.<br />
"Don, ultimately, is a man focused on results," Nicholson said.<br />
Laws acknowledged his occasional frustration with long council discussions.<br />
"The present council has been the most difficult for me to work with in terms of trying to get things done," he said. "But it's not because we have poor councilors. It's the opposite. We have councilors who are concerned about everything. Because we go into such detail, it drives other things out and puts a difficult burden on staff. It's been a hard time almost because the councilors are too good."<br />
Although he doesn't plan to run for elected office again, Laws said he hopes to stay involved by serving on city committees and commissions.<br />
"Believe it or not, I enjoy it," he said. "I'd hate to be in any community that does things where I don't have a say about it. I've had the ability to make those decisions. I hope they were good and intelligent decisions. I hope the city is at least 1 percent better because I was on the council."<br />

 <br />
1870 Census:<br />
Boy not living with parents, could be the Frank living with Leroy's father.  He is a well-to-do banker.<br />
 <br />
He was an incorporator of the Seneca Falls and Waterloo Railroad Company.<br />
-----------------------------------------<br />
From the History of Seneca County New York, 1876:<br />
Le Roy C. PARTRIDGE, son of Erastus Partridge, was born at Cayuga, July 10, 1832.  When about five years of age his parents removed to Seneca Falls.  Associates of his school days recollect a high-minded lad, ardent in scholastic research, a student of mechanics, and a lover of geologic investigation.<br />
Growing to manhood, influence, and usefulness, his cheerful and social disposition rendered his companionship attractive, genial, and pleasant, and surrounded him with an extended circle of warmly-attached friends.<br />
Employed in the Bank of Seneca Falls when twenty-one years of age, he became its cashier at the age of twenty-two.  Later, he was vice-president of the institution, and upon the death of his father became its president.  For several years he conducted an independent banking house at Ovid,-a great convenience to the people of the south jury district.  This institution, known as the Banking House of Le Roy C. Partridge, under the direction and impetus of its founder, has proved a sound and thriving business, and is still continued, under the control of Mrs. Ellen Partridge.  Mr. Partridge was also secretary and treasurer of the Seneca Falls Savings Bank.<br />
While seeking no political preferment, he shrank from no public duty, and when elected by large majorities to the positions of President of the village and Supervisor of the town, he discharged the functions of the office with zeal and honor.<br />
Le Roy C. Partridge was married in 1861 to Miss Ellen Deppen, daughter of William Deppen, then a resident of Seneca Falls.<br />
During the year 1874, failing health warned him to lay aside the onerous burdens borne for years, and seek in change of climate relaxation and recovery, but this was not to be, and in January, 1875, he returned to home and friends-to die.  Medical skill and the promptings of affection were of no avail, and cheerfully, as in health, he bore with suffering, and passed away on the morning of February 6, 1875.  The funeral took place at Trinity Church, in the afternoon of February 11, to which not only the friends at Seneca Falls, but many from neighboring villages proceeded.  During the time of the funeral, at which the Rev. Dr. Guion officiated, all places of business were closed, and the bells of the village were tolled.  Casket and church were adorned with floral offerings, and every mark of respect and sincere sympathy shown by the entire community.  His remains were taken to Restvale Cemetery for burial, and those who had so long and pleasantly known him in life now revert to the associations of the past, and study his character in public and private influences.  So well, so favorably known, and so intimately connected with the varied and material interests of the village, his loss fell little short of a public misfortune.<br />
In business and social relations his generosity was unstinted, and his personal intercourse with all won many sincere, devoted friends.  In sterling mental qualities, and in the kindly virtues of the heart, he won a place in the affections of kindred and friends beyond the limit of expression.  Eminently possessed of qualities and virtues of life, his friends were real, intimate, and numerous.  Scorning to do or countenance dishonorable actions, his sense of honor was proverbial, and his business relations were characterized by a scrupulous observance of the true spirit and very letter of every agreement.  Careful and sensitive of honor and integrity, the slightest shadow of reflection upon them was unendurable.  Sympathizing with want and distress, instances are numerous where munificent gifts for religious and benevolent objects illustrate philanthropy; and happily situated to relieve necessity, most generously did he avail himself of his opportunities.  Generous without being lavish, familiar without loss of dignity, he constantly maintained a natural ease and self-assertion which challenged regard, while good-nature, quiet humor, and courteous deportment marked him a favorite in social or business circle.<br />
Closely identified with matters of finance, the honorable position reached by the First National Bank of Seneca Falls is greatly the result of his faithful and sagacious efforts.  Realizing that the prosperity of business and manufacturing interests is the basis of successful banking, Mr. Partridge, wisely discriminating between the deserving and the unworthy, gave generous encouragement to these classes through periods of financial depression, and thereby contributed to the welfare and prosperity of the community at large.  The domestic virtues, personal excellence of character, frankness and liberality of Le Roy C. Partridge were known and admired by all.  Courteous and dignified, inflexibly exact, and scrupulously honest, he was honored for his worth.  Himself beneficent, kind, and sympathetic, like qualities were awakened towards him in the minds of relative, friend, and citizen.  Many besides his estimable family shared with them in grief at his death, and the name of Le Roy C. Partridge is deeply engraved and fondly remembered by those who knew him as a promising youth, a successful man, a kind husband, a valued citizen.<br />

From the Last Great West by Chester Earl Tupper<br />
In the fall of 1910 dad, John L. Tupper, came from Bassano to the Oyen district and homesteaded on Section 28-27-4 W4.  Dad had got a folder in Spokane that said, "The Last Great West" and there was a picture of a man ploughing and he was turning over dollar bills, so my dad worked his way through to the Oyen district.  He was "leery" of the rocks but we homesteaded anyway.<br />
In the spring of 1911 Dad, Mother and I came to stay.  I was 13 years old then and was born at Dundas, Minnesota. From Bassano we trailed across country with a sleigh and three horses.  Dad drove two horses and I rode the lead horse and drove it.  The road came in from the north at that time.  We had a closed-in sleigh with narrow runners and every time the sleigh slid off the trail I got the blame for it.<br />
Our first house and barn were built of lumber with car roofs.  We hauled the material from Alsask. My first school was Feadview and Mr. Wetheral taught us.  Then I went to school in Oyen.  My last teacher was Miss Ruby Scott.<br />
We had a preacher who rode horseback all over the country.  We held church and Sunday school in the pool hall.<br />
We had three horses, a six foot McCormick binder and a John Deere wooden beam walking plough.<br />
Mother and Father stayed on the homestead till April, 1920.  Mother and my brother Glen farmed until 1924 and then Glen went to North Dakota.  I went to the army in 1916 and came back in 1919 in June.<br />
I worked for Carl Neilson and Bill Morell and then I bought a place on the commons (SSB). In the fall of 1923 I gave that up and went home to help mother on the farm.  My first year, 1924, was a pigweed year.  I got 60 bushels wheat and 200 bushels pigweed off 100 acres.  It blew that year and the only place there was any wheat was in the sloughs.  In the fall I gave up the homestead.  My mother had gone to her sister in Los Angeles.  She died June 5, 1960<br />
I worked here, there and everywhere, 11 years for George Chalmers, a year for Joe Weichnik and then moved to town and have lived here since 1961.<br />
In the second war I was in the Veterans Guard of Canada: December 3, 1942, to September 5, 1946.<br />

Carol (Seejay51) stated that Sitric (she named him "Halfdansson" implyingthat he was son of Halfdan?) was father of Sitric King of Dublin & York.Todd Farmerie stated that the name of his father was not known, andnaming one's son after the father was not common custom. Todd did statethat Sitric, King of Dublin & York, was grandson of Inguar of Dublin (whoI take to be another name for Ivar the Boneless).<br />
 <br />
Stewart Baldwin, reviewing a book "Scandinavian Kings in the British Isles, 850-880" by Smyth, stated that Smyth said Sitric's father was also named Sitric (d. 896). Stewart Baldwin did not agree with the name (it was not the practice to name one's son after one's self), but did verify that Sitric King of Dublin & York was grandson of Ivar.<br />
 <br />
Stewart Baldwin, on his website entitled "The Kings of the Isle of Man", in the notes under "Table 1: Kings of Dublin" states that Ivar had a son Sitric, who died in 896. However he does not connect that Sitric with Sitric King of Dublin & York; EXCEPT to say that Harald King of Limerick, if not son of one Sitric, could be the son of the other Sitric, which seems to imply a relationship between the two Sitrics.<br />
 <br />
Note: Obviously this generation was named something, and "Sitric" is the only name given, so I am using it, even if possibly/probably wrong.<br />

From<br />
The History of Seneca County, 1876<br />
The early life of Erastus Partridge, connected with later successful effort, is replete with encouragement for emulative young men; and a brief sketch, while a fitting tribute to his memory, serves also as an exampler for those who would know how a poor boy may become the successful banker and skillful financier.<br />
Mr. Partridge was born near Norwich, Connecticut, on the 9th day of May, 179S. As in most instances of self-made men, pressed for means in early life, he won his way steadily to position, influence, and competence by industry and perseverance. In 1821 he came to this section of the State, settled at Cayuga, then a promising locality, where he engaged in the mercantile trade. Here was laid the foundation for successful and prosperous business, and here were the scenes and incidents to which in later years he frequently and fondly referred. During the year 1824 he established a branch store in Seneca Falls, and soon thereafter entered upon a large and lucrative trade; but it was not till 1837 that interests at Cayuga were transferred and a permanent removal made to Seneca County. From this time forward business increased, and his store became known as an established institution of the village. Keeping pace with town growth, his aid and encouragement were given to every worthy enterprise. He identified himself with various manufactures, and liberally advertising, made known to public favor his business interests. Kindly counseling and advising those who recognized his good judgment and ample qualifications and sought to profit by them, erratic conclusions were seldom made. Opinion or person was never obtruded, and he ever maintained both his dignity and deliberate judgment. He was ready to perceive, accurate to estimate character, prudent in opinion, and unswervable in principle. Remarkably successful in mercantile business, Mr. Partridge commenced private banking in 1848, and in the month of January, 1854, established the Bank of Seneca Falls, with a capital of fifty thousand dollars; himself president; his son, Leroy C. Partridge, cashier. This was the first bank organized at Seneca Falls, and was regarded by its business interests with no little pride and pleasure. The business of the bank increasing to an extent requiring all his time, Mr. Partridge disposed of his mercantile business, in the spring of 1856, to W. B. Lathrop, and devoted his entire attention to the banking interest. The bank, originally located in old Mechanics' Hall, was removed in April, 1858, into the new and commodious structure erected for banking purposes on Fall Street, and known as the " Bank Block." The bank, known as "individual," made contributory to the best interests   of the community, possessed its confidence and good will. Foreseeing and prudent, the great financial revulsion of 1857, which caused suspension of all but three or four banks of the State, found the Bank of Seneca Falls promptly meeting all its obligations, and paying in gold its notes presented for redemption. Known and continued as an individual bank until the inauguration of the national banking system, it was early changed by Mr. Partridge to "The First National Bank of Seneca Falls. - Associated with Mr. Partridge in the transaction of bank business have been his two sons, L. C. and D. E. Partridge, by whom the later affairs of the institution have been conducted.<br />
The death of Erastus Partridge occurred January 20, 1873, at the advanced age of seventy-four years. Impressed by sense of loss, business houses were closed and all classes of citizens united in expressions of sadness and regret at his decease. As a merchant and as a banker, the dealings of Mr. Partridge were characterized by business exactness; advantage was never taken of necessity, and he was lenient in the extreme to his debtors. To the influence of Mr. Partridge upon the mechanical industries of Seneca Falls is due much of their stability and ultimate extension. His domestic virtues, his personal excellencies of character endeared him to his relatives. He was a kind husband, an exemplary and considerate father. He had, on August 6, 1820, married, at Homer, Miss Sarah Bruffee, daughter of "William and Anna Bruffee, and for more than half a century they had journeyed through life in company. To his widow and children he left the priceless heritage of a stainless name and the memory of an exemplary life. In his social relations, his disposition and bearing towards neighbor and friend were frank and courteous, while all recognized in him a citizen who combined in one character modesty, kindness, sincerity, and integrity. Of kindly impulse, the comfort of others was second only to his efforts for their business advancement. Unostentatiously and quietly he gave of his abundance to the relief of the needy. Happy in the timely aid of worthy and judicious investments, his influence is yet manifest upon men now prosperous, who attribute their success to his timely advice and assistance. Invaluable to the community, Mr. Partridge lived to see his adopted home puss the doubtful era of its existence, and firmly established as a successful business community, and it is in strict justice that wherever the early history of Seneca County shall be known, the name of Erastus Partridge shall be coupled with it.<br />
Le Roy C. Partridge, son of Erastus Partridge, was born at Cayuga, July 16, 1832. "When about five years of age his parents removed to Seneca Falls. Associates of his school days recollect a high-minded lad, ardent in scholastic research, a student of mechanics, and a lover of geologic investigation.<br />
Growing to manhood, influence, and usefulness, his cheerful and social disposition rendered his companionship attractive, genial, and pleasant, and surrounded him with "an extended circle of warmly-attached friends. Employed in the Bank of Seneca Falls when twenty-one years of age, he became its cashier at the age of twenty-two. Later, he was vice-president of the institution, and upon the death of his father became its president. For several years he conducted an independent banking house at Ovid, - a great convenience to the people of the south jury district. This institution, known as the Banking House of Le Roy C. Partridge, under the direction and impetus of its founder, has proved a sound and thriving business, and is still continued, under the control of Mrs. Ellen Partridge. Mr. Partridge was also secretary and treasurer of the Seneca Falls Savings Bank.<br />
While seeking no political preferment, he shrank from no public duty, and when elected by large majorities to the positions of President of the village and Supervisor of the town, he discharged the functions of the office with zeal and honor.<br />
Le Roy C. Partridge was married in 1861 to Miss Ellen Deppen, daughter of "William Deppen, then a resident of Seneca Falls.<br />
During the year 1874, failing health warned him to lay aside the onerous burdens borne for years, and seek in change of climate relaxation and recovery; but this was not to be, and in January, 1875, he returned to home and friends- to die. Medical skill and the promptings of affection were of no avail, and cheerfully, as in health, he bore with suffering, and passed away on the morning of February 6, 1875. The funeral took place at Trinity Church, in the afternoon of February 11, to which not only the friends at Seneca Falls, but many from neighboring villages proceeded. During the time of the funeral, at which the Rev. Dr. Guion officiated, all places of business were closed, and the bells of the village were tolled. Casket and church were adorned with floral offerings, and every mark of respect and sincere sympathy shown by the entire community. His remains were taken to Reatvale Cemetery for burial, and those who had so long and pleasantly known him in life now revert to the associations of the past, and study his character in public and private influences. So well, so favorably known, and so intimately connected with the varied and material interests of the village, his loss fell little short of a public misfortune.<br />
In business and social relations his generosity was unstinted, and his personal inter- course with all won many sincere, devoted friends. In sterling mental qualities, and in the kindly virtues of the heart, he won a place in the affections of kindred and friends beyond the limit of expression. Eminently possessed of qualities and virtues of life, his friends were real, intimate, and numerous. Scorning to do or countenance dishonorable actions, his sense of honor was proverbial, and his business relations were characterized by a scrupulous observance of the true spirit and every letter of every agreement. Careful and sensitive of honor and integrity, the slightest shadow of reflection upon them was unendurable. Sympathizing with want and distress, in- stances are numerous where munificent gifts for religious and benevolent objects illustrate philanthropy; and happily situated to relieve necessity, most generously did he avail himself of his opportunities. Generous without being lavish, familar without loss of dignity, he constantly maintained a natural' ease and self-assertion which challenged regard, while good-nature, quiet humor, and courteous deportment marked him a favorite in social or business circle.<br />
Closely identified with matters of finance, the honorable position reached by the First National Bank of Seneca Falls is greatly the result of his faithful and sagacious efforts. Realizing that the prosperity of business and manufacturing interests is the basis of successful banking, Mr. Partridge, wisely discriminating between the deserving and the unworthy, gave generous encouragement to these classes through periods of financial depression, and thereby contributed to the welfare and prosperity of the community at large. The domestic virtues, personal excellence of character, frankness and liberality of Le Roy C. Partridge were known and admired by all.

Chuck Howard, a former producer at ABC Sports and winner of 11 EmmyAwards, died yesterday at his home in Pound Ridge, N.Y. He was 63.<br />
The cause was a brain tumor, his family said.<br />
In 1960, Mr. Howard took a career detour from Chase Manhattan Bank to become a production assistant at ABC Sports. He remained there for 26 years and is credited with being the first to use a split screen and an isolated camera to highlight a part of a play away from the main action.<br />
He became the vice president of production in 1968 and was part of the network's production teams for various events, including the Summer and Winter Olympics, the Super Bowl, the World Series and ''Wide World of Sports.''<br />
After Mr. Howard left ABC in 1986, he became the executive producer for the Big Ten Conference's football and basketball broadcasts. Three years later, he was named the executive producer of Trans World International, overseeing the production of figure skating and tennis events, the New York City Marathon, the America's Cup and world coverage of the Masters golf tournament.<br />
''As a producer he had a great ability to follow the story line,'' said Barry Frank, who worked with Mr. Howard at ABC and is president of Trans World, a subsidiary of the International Management Group. ''A lot of producers see a game from shot to shot or play to play, but don't see the storyline. Chuck was able to find it and follow it. He trained so many of today's best producers.''<br />
Mr. Howard is survived by his wife, Carolyn; three daughters, Dana, Dawn and Caroline, and a son, Christopher.<br />
 <br />
From Wikapedia:<br />
Charles (Chuck) Howard graduated from Duke University in 1955. He was a member of the Beta Theta Pi fraternity.<br />
Howard was a production assistant at Edgar J. Scherick's company, Sports Programs, Inc., in 1961 when Roone Arledge charged him with scouting sports events throughout the world in an effort to discover sports that had a loyal following but might be unknown to American television viewers. The result was the April 21, 1961 debut of Wide World of Sports on ABC Sports, the groundbreaking television sports program.<br />
Arledge, Howard and commentator Jim McKay created the show on a week-by-week basis during its first year of broadcast, establishing a sports television tradition in the process.<br />
Howard went on to become a vice president for programming at ABC Sports and covered nine Olympic Games, the Super Bowl, World Series, British Open, Kentucky Derby, Indianapolis 500 and NCAA football -- as well as Acapulco cliff diving, Demolition Derby, rodeos, bobsled racing, arm wrestling and Evel Knievel's daredevil antics.<br />
On April 8, 1967, due to an AFTRA strike, Howard and director Chet Forte filled-in as commentators for Game 4 of the NBA Eastern Conference Finals between the Boston Celtics and Philadelphia 76ers. He oversaw the broadcast of the 1972 Summer Olympics in Munich, Germany, notable for the massacre of 11 Israeli team members by Palestinian terrorists.<br />
In 1986, Howard left ABC and became executive producer at Trans World International.<br />
Howard died of brain cancer on November 21, 1996 in Pound Ridge, New York.<br />

Olaf SIHTRICSON, by name (in sagas) OLAF THE RED, or OLAFCUARAN, Olafalso spelled ANLAF (d. 981?, Iona?), king of the Danish kingdoms ofNorthumbria and of Dublin. He was the son of Sihtric, king of Deira, andwas related to the English king Aethelstan. When Sihtric died about 927Aethelstan annexed Deira, and Olaf took refuge in Scotland and in Irelanduntil937, when he was one of the leaders of the formidable league ofprinces that was destroyed by Aethelstan at the famous Battle ofBrunanburh. Again he sought a homeamong his kinsfolk in Ireland, but justafter Aethelstan's death in 940he or Olaf Guthfrithson was recalled toEngland by the Northumbrians.  Both crossed over, and in 941 the newEnglish king, Edmund, gave up Deira to the former. The peace between theEnglish and Danes did not, however, last long. Wulfstan, archbishop ofYork, sided with Olaf; but in944 Olaf was driven from Northumbria byEdmund, and crossing to Ireland, Olaf ruled over the Danish kingdom ofDublin. From 949 to 952 he was again king of Northumbria, until he wasexpelled once more (this time by Erik Bloodaxe), and he passed theremainder of his active life in warfare in Ireland. But in 980 hisdominion was shattered by the defeat of the Danes at the Battle of Tara.He went to Iona, where he died probably in981, although one dubiousaccount says he was in Dublin in 994.[Britannica CD '97]<br />
