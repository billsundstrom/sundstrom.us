Ralph DE BACONS-THORPE
<p>
<a name ="I015360"><b>[I015360]</b></a><br />
Ranulph "Ralph" m. Unknown. Resided at Thorpe, County Norfolk, called Baconsthorpe by distinction. Cutter says he was known as Ralph de Bacons-Thorpe (thorp means village). In Colonial Families of the United States, Ralph is called "Ran(d)ulf." There were several places called Thorp in Norfolk and he added this name to distinguish him from other lords of Thorp.<br>
Children:<br>
  1. George Bacon.<br>
  2. Roger Bacon.<br>
  3. Agnes Bacon.<br>
  4. Gilbert Bacon. Gilbert's direct line extends only five generation to Jordan, Adam, Peter and ends with Batrianus Yorkshire Bacon.<br>

John DE BALIOL
<p>
<a name ="I008828"><b>[I008828]</b></a><br />
DUNNIDEER FAMILY: The Dunnideer homestead was built by Jocelyn de Baliol, uncle of King John Baliol c. 1260 and probably was given to Tyrees as payment for military services before 1292, certainly before 1296. But tradition says the original use of the 300' hill ("dunn") was by Gregorythe Great, primarily as a stronghold to protect the Valley of Insch; and that it became his favorite residence; he died there in 892. Literature mentions "Donudoure" as one of the places King Arthur held court. Today the 550A Dunnideer Main (farm) is located 30 miles from Aberdeen, near the town of Insch and on Chevic Burn (appears in some writings as the Ouri River). Atop the dunn still are to be found the vitrionized vestiges of an old Pictic fort and abby with some attesting stone pillars ("fortalices") in place around its base. The Baliol castle retains only apart of its foundation and its 6' thick outer limit walls containing an entrance door with a sentry lookout -- all preserved under the National Trust of Scotland. There is also the ruin of another (probable Tyree) homestead, northwest of the Castle. Three ash trees stand in front of this (customarily planted to keep away witches). The modern dwelling that bears the name was built c.1796, well after the Tyree's lost Dunnideer in 1724 as a penalty for their Jacobite committments. The property was first passed into the hands of the Leiths of Overhall and later, by purchase, came into the possession of the Gordons of Wardhouse and Kildrummy. As a working and profitable farm (primarily for sheep), it has been easily marketable through the years<br>

Joan Plantagenet DE BEAUFORT
<p>
<a name ="I008251"><b>[I008251]</b></a><br />
Joan Beaufort, Countess of Westmorland, (c.1379 - 13 November 1440), was the fourth child (and only daughter) of John of Gaunt and his mistress Katherine Swynford. Joan married Robert Ferrers, 3rd Baron Ferrers of Wemme, and they had two daughters before he died. Along with her three brothers, Joan was privately declared legitimate by their cousin Richard II of England in 1390, but for some reason their father secured another such declaration from Parliament in January 1397. Perhaps the reason was that on 3 February 1397, when she was 18, Joan married Ralph Neville, 1st Earl of Westmorland, who had also been married once before. They had at least ten children, one of whom was Cecily Neville (1415 - 1495) ("Proud Cis"), who married Richard, Duke of York (1411 - 1460), and two of their children became Edward IV of England and Richard III of England.<br>
<br>
Joan died on 13 November 1440 and was entombed next to her mother in the sanctuary of Lincoln Cathedral. Joan's is the smaller of the two tombs; both were decorated with brass plates -- full-length representations of them on the tops, and small shields bearing coats of arms around the sides -- but those were damaged or destroyed in 1644 during the English Civil War. A 1640 drawing of them survives, showing what the tombs looked like when they were intact, and side-by-side instead of end-to-end, as they are now.<br>

Henry DE BEAUMONT
<p>
<a name ="I012524"><b>[I012524]</b></a><br />
Henry de Beaumont, 1st Earl of Warwick, so created between July and Dec1088 and granted lands which up till two years previously had belonged toa Saxon Thane, Turkill or Turchil of Arden (an ancestor of William Shakespeare); born c1048; granted feudal Lordship of Gower, South Walesby Henry I some time between 1106 and 1116 and died most probably 20 June1119. [Burke's Peerage]<br>
<br>
The first who bore the title of Earl of Warwick, after the Norman Conquest, was Henry de Newburgh (so called from the castle of that name in Normandy), a younger son of Roger de Bellomont, Earl of Mellent. Whenthis eminent person obtained that earldom is not exactly ascertained, but Sir William Dugdale presumed the period to be toward the close of the Conqueror's reign, "for then," saith he, "King William, having begirt Warwick with a mighty ditch, for the precinct of its walls, and erected the gates at his own charge, did promote this Henry to the earldom, and annexed thereto the royalty of the borough, which at that time belonged to the crown." But, though Henry de Newburgh was made Earl of Warwick by the first Norman sovereign, he was not invested with all the lands attached to the earldom until the ensuing reign, as we find William Rufus, soon after his accession to the throne, conferring upon him the whole inheritance of Turchil de Warwick, a Saxon, who, at the coming of Duke William, had the reputation of earl; and thenceforth the "bear and ragged staff," the device of Turchil's family derived from the chivalrous Guy, Earl of Warwick, was assumed by the first of the Newburgh dynasty, and it has been continued ever since as a badge of the successive Earls of Warwick. The name of this Henry, Earl of Warwick, appears as a witness to the charter of King Henry I, whereby that prince confirmed the laws of Edward the Confessor, and granted many other immunities to the clergy and laity. His lordship m. Margaret, dau. of Geffrey, Count de Moreton, and sister of Rotrode, Earl of Perch, and had issue, two daus., whose names are not mentioned, and five sons, viz., Roger, his successor; Henry; Geffrey; Rotrode, bishop of Evreux; and Robert, seneschal and justice of Normandy, who was a great benefactor to the abbey of Bec in which he was afterwards shorn a monk and d. in 1123.<br>
<br>
This Earl Henry commenced imparking Wedgenock, near his castle of Warwick, following the example of his sovereign, King Henry, who made the first park that had ever been in England, at Woodstock. His lordship, who was as memorable for pious foundations as distinguished for military achievements, d. in 1123 and was s. by his eldest son, Roger de Newburgh.[Sir Bernard Burke, Dormant, Abeyant, Forfeited and Extinct Peerages, Burke's Peerage, Ltd., London, 1883, p. 399, Newburgh, Earls of Warwick]<br>
<br>
The earldom of Warwick was created by William II in 1088 for Henry de Beaumont, who had held Warwick castle since its building by William the Conqueror 20 years before.<br>
<br>
Henry, younger brother of Robert, count of Meulan, was lord of Neubourg, near Beaumont-le-Roger in Normandy, and Rufus gave him the great midland estate of the English noble, Thurkill of Arden. The new earl was an intimate friend of Henry I, whose succession he did much to promote. He died in 1123 and was buried at Preaux (Normandy). Roger, his eldest son, held the earldom until his death in 1153. [Encyclopædia Britannica, 1961ed., Vol. 23, p. 375, EARLS OF WARWICK]<br>

<br>
On Leicester, Earldom of [Burke's Peerage, p. 1671]:<br>
<br>
Robert de Beaumont, a companion in arms of William I (The Conqueror) atHastings was granted after the Conquest much land in the Midlands of England, but most of it was in Warwickshire rather than Leicestershire.Indeed his younger brother became Earl of Warwick. Robert also held territory in Normandy and is usually referred to as Count of Meulan. He was a leading political figure in the reigns of William II and Henry Iand on the death of one Ives de Grandmesnil in the First Crusade, the funds for campaigning in which Ives had raised from Robert on the security of his estates, [Robert] came into full possession of them, including a sizeable part of Leicester. The rest of the town was granted him by Henry I and it is possible that he became Earl of Leicester.<br>
<br>

<br>
EARLDOM OF LEICESTER (I) 1107 ?<br>
<br>
ROBERT DE BEAUMONT, SEIGNEUR OF BEAUMONT, PONT-AUDEMER, BRIONNE ANDVATTEVILLE in Normandy, and from 1081 COUNT OF MEULAN in the FrenchVexin, son and heir, born circa 1046. When very young he accompanied DukeWilliam to England and distinguished himself at the battle of Hastings,and received large grants of lands in co. Warwick, with smaller holdingsin cos. Leicester, Northants, and Wilts. On 14 July 080, as Robert de Bellomonte, he witnessed the foundation charter of Lessay, and next year he inherited from his mother's family the comté of Meulan. Thereafter he is continuously styled Count (Comes) of Meulan. After the death of the Conqueror he adhered to William Rufus, and was high in favour at his court. He quarrelled with Robert of Normandy about the castellanship of Brionne, in consequence of the exchange of Brionne for Ivry made by hisfather. He was imprisoned, but was released at the intercession of his father Roger, who eventually succeeded in obtaining Brionne in fee. He succeeded to the greater part of his father's lands in Normandy,including Beaumont, Pont-Audemer, Vatteville and Brionne. This paternalinheritance, added to his French comté and his great possessions in cos.Warwick and Leicester, made him one of the most powerful vassals of theCrown. He became one of the chief lay ministers of William Rufus, withwhom he sided against Robert Courtheuse in 1098, and when William invadedthe French Vexin in 1097 he received his troops in his fortresses of thecomté of Meulan. After the death of William Rufus he became one of thechief advisers of Henry I. On the death of Ives de Grandmesnil onCrusade, Robert retained his estates, which Ives had mortgaged to himcirca 1102. Thereby he acquired one-quarter of the town of Leicester, the whole of which was later granted to him by the King. Robert thus added largely to his already vast possessions. In 1104 he was one of the Normanbarons who adhered to Henry on his arrival in Normandy. He was present in the King's army at Tenchebrai, 28 September 1106. In 1110 he was besieged at Meulan by Louis VI, who took the castle by storm, but in the followingyear he retaliated by a raid on Paris, which he plundered. Afterobtaining the whole town of Leicester he is said to have become EARL OFLEICESTER, but, being already Count of Meulan, was never so styled. Thereis no contemporary record that he had the third penny of the pleas of the county, but he doubtless acquired, with the Grandmesnil fief, the thirdpenny of the issues of the Mint at Leicester.<br>
<br>
He married, in 1096, Isabel, called also Elizabeth, daughter of Hugh DE CREPl, called Hug "le Grand," COUNT OF VERMANDOIS. He died 5 June 1118,and was buried with his ancestors in the chapter house of Préaux (c). His widow married, very shortly after his death, William (DE WARINNE), EARLOF SURREY. [Complete Peerage VII:523-6, (transcribed by Dave Utzinger)]<br>
<br>
(c) Robert had three sons and five daughters. The sons were Waleran and Robert, twins born in 1104, and Hugh. Waleran, the eldest, succeeded to the Norman and French fiefs, and the English lands held by his grandfather, Roger de Beaumont in 1086. Robert succeeded his father as Earl of Leicester and Hugh is said to have been created Earl of Bedford.The names of only four of the daughter appear to be known--Adeline,Aubreye, Maud and Isabel or Elizabeth. Adeline m. Hugh IV Seigneur of Montfort-sur-Risle. Aubreye m. Hugh II Seigneur of Chateauneuf-en-Thimerais. Maud m. William Louvel, Seigneur of Ivri andBreval. Isabel, also called Elizabeth, was mistress of Henry I, and m.Gilbert de Clare, Earl of Pembroke.<br>

From Wikipedia<br>
<br>
Robert de Beaumont, 1st Earl of Leicester and Count of Meulan (died June 5, 1118) was a powerful English and French nobleman, revered as one of the wisest men of his age. Chroniclers speak highly of his eloquence, his learning, and three kings of England valued his counsel.<br>
<br>
He was the eldest son of Roger de Beaumont and Adeline of Meulan, and an older brother of Henry de Beaumont, 1st Earl of Warwick. He accompanied William the Conqueror to England in 1066, where his service earned him more than 91 lordships and manors. When his mother died in 1081, Robert inherited the title of Count of Meulan. In 1100 Robert was with William Rufus in the New Forest when the latter died under sudden and violent circumstances. He then pledged alligience to William Rufus' brother, Henry I of England, who created him Earl of Leicester in 1107.<br>
<br>
In 1096 he married Isabella de Vermandois, daughter of Hugh Magnus and a scion of the French royal family. Their children were:<br>
<br>
   1. Emma de Beaumont (born 1102)<br>
   2. Waleran IV de Beaumont, Count of Meulan (born 1104)<br>
   3. Robert de Beaumont, 2nd Earl of Leicester (born 1104)<br>
   4. Hugh de Beaumont, Earl of Bedford (born c. 1106)<br>
   5. Adeline de Beaumont, married Hugh IV of Montfort-sur-Risle<br>
   6. Amicia de Beaumont, married Hugh of Château-neuf-Thimerais<br>
   7. Aubrey de Beaumont, married William Lovel<br>
   8. Isabel de Beaumont, a mistress of King Henry I of England and the mother of Strongbow.<br>
<br>
According to Henry of Huntingdon, Robert died of shame after "a certain earl carried off the lady he had espoused, either by some intrigue or by force and stratagem." His wife Isabella remarried in 1118 to William de Warenne, 2nd Earl of Surrey.<br>
</p>
Robert II DE BEAUMONT
<p>
<a name ="I004834"><b>[I004834]</b></a><br />
Robert de Beaumont, 2nd Earl of Leicester (1104-5 April 1168), also known as Robert "Le Bossu" (meaning "Robert the Uneven" in French), was an English nobleman of French ancestry. He was the son of Robert de Beaumont, 1st Earl of Leicester and the twin brother of Waleran de Beaumont.<br>
<br>
The two brothers, Robert and Waleran, were adopted into the royal household shortly after their father's death (upon which instance Robert inherited all of his father's hereditary titles, chiefly Earl of Leicester). They accompanied King Henry I among various missions, firstly to Normandy, then to meet with Pope Callixtus II in 1119. In 1135, the two twins were present at King Henry's deathbed; the monarch's death led to The Anarchy (under the weak rule of King Stephen), and Robert eventually captured his rival, Roger de Tosny. In June of 1139, the inseparable brothers led the actions against Roger of Salisbury (the Bishop of Salisbury) and Alexander (the Bishop of Lincoln); the former was killed in December of that year, while the latter survived for eight more years.<br>
<br>
King Stephen had taken the two brothers as his personal advisors; the two brothers remained in his confidence for several decades. However, after Stephen's compromise with his wife, Matilda (wherein Henry, Matilda's son from a previous marriage, would succeed Stephen as king), the twins provided Henry, soon to be crowned Henry II of England, with "means for his struggle." Thereafter, the brothers were in the new monarch's confidence, as evidenced by Robert's appointment as chief justiciar and as a hereditary steward; eventually, he bought out Hugh Bigod, 1st Earl of Norfolk (another noble who enjoyed the confidence of the crown) and is considered the first Lord High Steward of England. Robert enjoyed a high status in Henry's court, even acting as head of the kingdom (in a vice-regal capacity) for a time. His name appeared at the top of the Constitutions of Clarendon, and he was present at the Council of Northampton.<br>
<br>
He married Amice de Montfort, and they had four children:<br>
   1. Hawise, who married William FitzRobert, 2nd Earl of Gloucester;<br>
   2. Robert, who became 3rd Earl of Leicester;<br>
   3. Isabel, who married Simon Saint-Lis, 2nd Earl of Northampton;<br>
   4. Margaret, who married Ralph V de Tosny<br>
</p>
Robert III DE BEAUMONT
<p>
<a name ="I005261"><b>[I005261]</b></a><br />
Robert de Beaumont, 3rd Earl of Leicester (died 1190) was an English nobleman, one of the principal followers of Henry the Young King in the Revolt of 1173-1174 against his father Henry II. He is also called Robert Blanchemains (meaning "White Hands" in French).<br>
<br>
He was the son of Robert de Beaumont, 2nd Earl of Leicester, a staunch supporter of Henry II, and he inherited from his father large estates in England and Normandy.<br>
<br>
When the revolt of the younger Henry broke out in April 1173, Robert went to his castle at Breteuil in Normandy. The rebels' aim was to take control of the duchy, but Henry II himself led an army to besiege the castle; Robert fled, and the Breteuil was taken on September 25 or 26.<br>
<br>
Robert apparently went to Flanders, where he raised a large force of mercenaries, and landed at Walton, Suffolk, on September 29, 1173. He joined forces with Hugh Bigod, 1st Earl of Norfolk, and the two marched west, aiming to cut England in two across the Midlands and to relieve the king's siege of Robert's castle at Leicester. However, they were intercepted by the king's supporters and defeated in battle at Fornham, near Bury St Edmunds, on October 17. Robert, along with his wife and many others, was taken prisoner. Henry II took away the earl's lands and titles as well.<br>
<br>
He remained in captivity until January 1177, well after most of the other prisoners had been released. The king was in a strong position and could afford to be merciful; not long after his release Robert's lands and titles were restored, but not his castles. All but two of his castles had been destroyed, and those two (Montsorrel in Leicestershire and Pacy in Normandy) remained in the king's hands.<br>
<br>
Robert had little influence in the remaining years of Henry II's reign, but was restored to favor by Richard I. He carried one of the swords of state at Richard's coronation in 1189. In 1190 Robert went on pilgrimage to Palestine, but he died in Greece on his return journey.<br>
<br>
Robert married Pernelle, who was either a granddaughter or great-granddaughter of Hugh de Grandmesnil. They had 5 children:<br>
    * Robert, who succeeded his father as Earl of Leicester;<br>
    * Roger, who became Bishop of St Andrews in 1189;<br>
    * William, who was a leper;<br>
    * Amicia, who married Simon de Montfort, and whose son Simon subsequently became Earl of Leicester;<br>
    * Margaret, who married Saer de Quincy, later 1st Earl of Winchester.<br>

Roger DE BEAUMONT
<p>
<a name ="I004835"><b>[I004835]</b></a><br />
Roger de Beaumont; Seigneur (feudal Lord) of Beaumont, Pontaudemer,Brionne and Vatteville, Normandy; married Adeline, sister of Hugh Countof Meulan and daughter by his 1st wife of Waleran Count ofMeulan.[Burke's Peerage]<br>
<br>
---------------------------------------<br>
<br>
The well-known Roger de Beaumont held Sturminster Marshal, Dorset, in1086; it descended to the counts of Meulan through Roger's eldest son,Robert count of Meulan. That Roger took his name from Beaumont is a partofthe general history of Normandy. It follows that Roger's descendants,the counts of Meulan, the Earls of Leicester, and the Earls of Warwick,all derive from Beaumont-le-Roger. [The Origins of Some Anglo-NormanFamilies]<br>
<br>
Roger was one of the most powerful noblemen of his era. He furnishedsixty warships for William the Conqueror's invasion fleet, but remainedbehind to govern Normandy in William's absence. In later life, he becamea monk.<br>

Stephen II Henry DE BLOIS
<p>
<a name ="I095255"><b>[I095255]</b></a><br />
From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia.<br>
<br>
Stephen II Henry (c. 1045 - May 19, 1102), (French, Etienne Henri) Count of Blois and Count of Chartres, was the son of Theobald III, Count of Blois, and Garsinde du Maine.<br>
<br>
In about 1080, in Chartres, France, Stephen married Adela of Normandy, a daughter of William the Conqueror. Their eldest son, Guillaume, was disinherited, supposedly for mental weakness; he was made Count of Chartres instead. Blois then passed to the second son, Theobald. Their third son Stephen of Blois became King of England after Henry I of England died without a male heir and the English did not think Henry I's daughter Empress Matilda a suitable ruler because of her sex. Stephen and Adela's youngest son was Henry of Blois, bishop of Winchester. A daughter, Lucia-Mahaut de Blois, perished in the White Ship disaster.<br>
<br>
Count Stephen was one of the leaders of the First Crusade, often writing enthusiastic letters to Adela about the crusade's progress. He returned home in 1098 during the lengthy siege of Antioch, without having fulfilled his crusading vow, which would have been completed only if he had made it all the way to Jerusalem. He was pressured by Adela into making a second pilgrimage, and along with others who faced the same pressures after returning home prematurely, he joined the minor crusade of 1101. In 1102, Stephen was killed in battle at the age of 57, during the Crusader Kingdom of Jerusalem's siege of Ascalon in what is now Israel.<br>

He was the son of Humphrey de Bohun, by Eleanor de Braose, a daughter of William de Braose, Lord of Abergavenny and Eve Marshall. His mother died in 1251; his father died in 1265 of wounds sustained at the Battle of Evesham. He succeeded his grandfather, Humphrey de Bohun, 2nd Earl of Hereford, in 1275. The 3rd Earl was also the 2nd Earl of Essex, and held the positions of Lord Warden of the Cinque Ports, and Constable of all England.<br>
<br>
Humphrey de Bohun took part in Roger Mortimer's war against the Welsh, and was present at the defeat at Cefnllys in November, 1262, by Llywelyn ap Gruffydd. He died at Pleshy Castle, in Essex.<br>

<a name ="I015109"><b>[I015109]</b></a><br />
Humphrey de Bohun, 4th Earl of Hereford (1276 - March 16, 1322) was a member of an important Norman family of the Welsh Marches. His father was Humphrey de Bohun, 3rd Earl of Hereford and his mother was Maud de Fiennes, daughter of Enguerrand II de Fiennes. He was born at Pleshey Castle located in Essex, England. The castle is nothing more than an earthwork ruin now.<br>
<br>
He succeeded his father to the titles of Earl of Hereford and Baron de Bohun. Humphrey held the title of "Bearer of the Swan Badge". He married Elizabeth of Rhuddlan, daughter of King Edward I of England and his first Queen consort Eleanor of Castile, on November 14, 1302, at Westminster. She gave him 10 children:<br>
   1. Margaret de Bohun (September 1303 - 1305)<br>
   2. Eleanor de Bohun (October 1304), married James Butler, 1st Earl of Ormonde and Thomas, Lord Dagworth.<br>
   3. Humphrey de Bohun (1305 - died young)<br>
   4. John de Bohun, 5th Earl of Hereford (November 23, 1306 - 1335)<br>
   5. Humphrey de Bohun, 6th Earl of Hereford (December 6, 1309 - 1361)<br>
   6. Margaret de Bohun (April 3, 1311 - 1391), married Hugh Courtenay, 2nd Earl of Devon<br>
   7. William de Bohun, 1st Earl of Northampton (1312-1360). Twin of Edward.<br>
   8. Edward de Bohun (1312 - 1334). Twin of William.<br>
   9. Eneas de Bohun, died after 1322, when he's mentioned in his father's will.<br>
  10. Isabel de Bohun (May 5, 1316). Elizabeth died in childbirth, and this child died a few days afterwards.<br>
<br>
At the battle of Bannockburn, he charged alone at Robert the Bruce, only to be felled and held for ransom for the Bruce's wife. In this battle his nephew Henry de Bohun was also killed by Bruce. Humphrey was killed while fighting Andrew de Harclay, at the Battle of Boroughbridge in a particularly gory manner. As recounted in The Greatest Traitor by Ian Mortimer, page 124:<br>
<br>
    "[The 4th Earl of] Hereford led the fight on the bridge, but he and his men were caught in the arrow fire. Then one of de Harclay's pikemen, concealed beneath the bridge, thrust upwards between the planks and skewered the Earl of Hereford through the anus, twisting the head of the iron pike into his intestines. His dying screams turned the advance into a panic."<br>

Humphrey DE BOHUN
<p>
<a name ="I015941"><b>[I015941]</b></a><br />
This family originated from Bohun in the arrondissement of St-Lo in the Cotentin, Normandy, where there still exists St-Andre and St-Georges de Bohon. The mound of the old castle is still visible. He was a companion of the Conqueror at Senlac, who at that time held the fief. He is reputed to have been a near kinsman of Duke William, but how or to what degree is not clear. The fact remains that the witnesses to the Benedictine priory at St-George's in 1092, were all members of King William's immediate family or branches thereof. He was married 3X, names unknown, and d. prior to 1113, leaving three sons, Robert, Richard de Meri, sire de Bohun, and Humphrey II. [Falaise Roll, p. 57]<br>
The Bohuns of Midhurst who actually held Bohon in the 12th century descended in the male line from Savaric son of Cana and the vicomtes of Beaumont in Maine. The earls of Hereford who descended in the paternal line from Bohun were a younger branch. [Anglo-Norman Families, p. 16]<br>
A modest Norman nobleman. Gained his fortune at an early age by accompanying William the Conqueror on his grand adventure. Founded the Bohon Priory in Normandy and gave birth to two branches of the family.<br>
Godfather of William the Conqueror.<br>
The oldest mention of Humphrey is in William's journals. It confirms a donation made at the abbey of St. Trinite du Mont at Rouen by Gilbert, Osbern's vassal. William's signature is accompanied by that of Humphrey, son of Richard, listed with the rest of William's men.<br>
A document signed by Sir William, duke of the Normands, before 1066 shows that Humphrey de Bohon gave a garden from his fief in Puchay to the nuns of St. Amand in Rouen for the repose of his soul and those of his three wives when one of his daughters became religious.<br>
The monastery of St. Leger in Preaux was given the deeds to Barbeville, St. Marie's Church, the town of Carentan, and the neighboring rectory. Later Humphrey bequeathed the monastery a convent that his second daughter entered. Humphrey's sons Robert and Richard agreed with his actions. On the Bayeux tapestry, in a meal scene presided over by Bishop Odo, a bearded man is sitting to William's right. It is possible that this is Humphrey de Bohon with the Beard, who would occupy a place of honor at the table out of respect for his age.<br>
In 1076, on King William's orders, in the Act of Cherbourg he renders justice with the monks at the Heauville Priorty against Bertram de Bricquebec, viscount of Cotentin who had levied unfair taxes on his people. Humphrey is mentioned in the Domesday Book as a champion and defender of the throne, and as lord of Taterford in Norfolk. Much of his wealth is attributed to the goodwill of William and the spoils of the campaigns, which was not a unique situation. However, the possession of large estates and properties in England was not all fun; they were hard to protect from raiders and warring lords. Humphyre probably also benefited from Normandy's continued growth and profits from his holdings.<br>
Humphrey d. 1080/93; father of:<br>
1. Robert, d. young<br>
2. Humphrey<br>
3. Richard<br>
4. Enguerran, monk at Marmoutier in the Bohon priory<br>

Humphrey I DE BOHUN
<p>
<a name ="I015937"><b>[I015937]</b></a><br />
3rd son of Honfroi de Bohun. Ancestor of the earls of Hereford, Sussex and Northampton. The e arls of Northampton were hereditary constables of England. Alliances in the female line wer e made with Thomas of Woodstock, earl of Gloucester, son of Henry III, and with Henry Bolingb roke, son of John of Gaunt, duke of Lancaster, and subsequently King Henry IV. [Falaise Roll , p. 57]<br>
Benefitted in the favor of Kings William Rufus and Henry I of England. His marriage to the da u. of Edward of Salisbury gave him much honor and wealth; d. 1129.<br>
The sources for this branch of the Bohons, earls of Hereford, Essex, and Northampton, ar e all English. The name Bohon was changed to Boun, Boon, Bowne, etc. It was later considere d to signify master or boss. Humfridus, Onfroi, and Honfroy are translated as Humphrey.<br>
The frequent repetition of the first name Humphrey causes a lot of confusion. The Englis h begin their line with the first Humphrey born in Great Britain, who is our Humphrey II.<br>
Humphrey II, known as Humphrey the Magnificnt or Humphrey the Great, benefitted from the f avor of King William Rufus. His signature is on a number of papers of Henry I. Thus we can fo llow him around England (1103-1109, then in Normandy at Avranches (1113) and Rouen (1119, the n in England (1121), back to Rouen (1125), and back to England (1128).<br>
Humphrey II gave the church of Bishop Street in Salisbury (Wiltshire) to the Lewes Abbey ( next to Newhaven) and the church of Cheleworth to the St. Dennis priory (Southampton). He wa s a witness at the founding of Savigney Abbey by Ralph de Fougeres.<br>
</p>
Humphrey II DE BOHUN
<p>
<a name ="I015938"><b>[I015938]</b></a><br />
Inherited the greater part of the possession of Miles of Gloucester on the extinction of his male issue, by marrying his eldest daughter Margaret. He had consistently supported Henry II, notably in 1173, when he assisted to defeat and capture the earl of Leicester at Fornham in Suffolk, and his grandson, Henry de Bohun, was rewarded for the loyalty of his family on 28 April 1200, by a charter granting him 20 pounds yearly from the third penny of the county o f Hereford, thereby making him earl thereof, on condition that if King John should have an y heir by his wedded wife, Henry de Bohun should claim nothing by the charter which Henry I I gave to Roger of Gloucester. [The Victoria History of the Counties of England: Herefordshire, p. 361]<br>
<br>
He died in 1187; aide and counselor to Henry I; constable of England; aided Empress Mathilda against King Steven and later reaped the fruits of his choice during the rule of Henry II, with who m he was familiar.<br>
Lord of Trowbridge; very close to Henry I and later Henry II; assisted<br>
Empress Mathilda against King Stephen. b. 1109, d. 6 Apr 1187; m. Margery/Marguerite/Margaret, eldest daughter of Milo of Gloucester , from whom he received the hereditary right to the title of Constable of England.<br>
Humphrey III was steward and chancellor to Henry I, perhaps following his father. He share d this post with Hugh Bigot/Bigod, Robert Haye, and Simon de Beauchamp. Sometimes he is confused with his father.<br>
We can follow Humphrey III in the entourage of King Henry I by the documents he signed a t Arques and Dieppe (1131), various English towns (1131-3), in Normandy at Rouen (1133-4), and at Argentan (1133-4).<br>
When Steven of Blois, Earl of Mortain, was crowned king of England after Henry I d. 1135 , Humphrey kept his duties as steward presiding over charters. Two were written at Evreux in 1137. One concerned infractions against God; the other gave land in Bramford (Suffolk) to St. Mary d'Evreux. In 1139 Empress Mathilda arrived in Sussex with her half-bro Robert of Gloucester to reclaim the inheritance of their father. Humphrey, at the instigation of his fat her-in-law, Milo de Gloucester, rallied with Mathilda and defended Trowbridge against King Steven.<br>
During the troublesome years of the anarchy that followed, Humphrey passionately fought with Mathilda's loyal and true followers. He witnessed Milo being named earl of Hereford in recognition of his services on 25 July 1141.<br>
After initial success, the Battle of Winchester (1141) marked a turnaround and Humphrey was taken prisoner.<br>
In 1143 in Devizes (Wiltshire), Mathilda reinstated possession of lands and the office o f chancellor of England to Humphrey in a written document. She also gave him new wealth and l and: Melchesam, Boczam, Malmesbury, and Stokes-Wiltshire. Humphrey had been relieved of his duties after the reign of Henry I.<br>
Humphrey signed a document of Prince Henry in 1149-50 at Devizes and another in 1150-1 at Argentan.<br>
In 1150 Trowbridge Castle was taken by King Stephen.<br>
When the abbey church of Montebourg was dedicated in 1152, Humphrey consented to the gif t of the church of St. Gregoire de Catz by Ildebert de Catz and Steven de Magneville.<br>
Because of his role as Lord Chancellor and his signatures on numerous documents, we are able to account for Humphrey's whereabouts. He was in England with the king (1153-4), in Normandy (1156) at Argenta, Falaise, and Quevily (1174), with his peers in Chinon (1170-3), back in England (between 1174-9), and again in Normandy at Valognes, Cherbourg, and Bonneville-sur-Touques<br>
(1180-2).<br>
In April 1173 when Prince Henry rebelled against his father, King Henry II, Humphrey stood by the king. With Richard de Lucy he invaded Scotland in an attack against King William the Lion who supported Prince Henry and the destruction of the bishop's palace at Durham. Humphrey and company burned Berwick and penetrated deeply into Scotland. But when they learned of the landing of Robert de Beaumont (earl of Leicester and friend of Prince Henry) in Suffolk (29 Sep 1173), they made a truce with William the Lion and marched against Beaumont. Humphrey battled with the help of the peasants and was taken prisoner with his wife at Fornham St. Genevie re near Bury St. Edmond (Suffolk) on 16 Oct 1173. The prisoners were taken to Falaise Castle.<br>
1 Dec 1174/5 in Falaise, Humphrey witnessed a peace accord between Henry II and William the Lion recognizing the sovereigncy of England over Scotland.<br>
Humphrey's fortune considerably increased with the death of his father-in-law, Milo of Gloucester, who without male heirs left a third of his wealth to each daughter. Humphrey also inherited the position of Constable of England that was held by his father-in-law. In 1166 Humphrey inherited three half parts of a knight's fees (rent) from his grandfather's provinces an d nine half parts "de novo." His wife received 17 parts from Milo's provinces and three 3/4 p arts of her brothers' land.<br>
He kept in Normandy a part of the inheritance from Humphrey I, particularly land at Carentan and Pont D'Ouve. A document confirmed the gifts of his ancestors and the men of the Boho n priory. Among the witnesses of this act were Enjuger de Bohon, Robert of Bohon priory, Duch ess Margaret, and Henry de Bohon.<br>
A letter from Humphrey de Bohon to the men of Normandy and England stated that Humphrey an d his son gave to the Blanchelande Abbey the title of Moulin de Biard with Pont D'Ouve.<br>
In 1181 with Alexander de Bohon he witnessed the foundation of Barbery Abbey.  Across the Channel Humphrey founded the priory of Monkton Farley (Wiltshire) with his wife, supported by the Lewes Abbey. Near the beautiful forests and streams in England, his rich endowment provided them with a large yearly income. Among the benefactors associated with this foundation are Mathilda de Bohon (his mother), Ildebert de Catz (Chaz), Robert de Carentan, and his vassals; among the witnesses were William de Beuzeville an d Humphrey de St. Vigor.<br>
He had a son, Humphrey IV, and a daughter, Margaret, 1st wife of Waleran, Earl of Warwick. [Les Seigneurs de Bohon]<br>
