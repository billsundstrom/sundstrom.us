[Caulkins.FTW]<br>
<br>
Death was 1617 - didn't match burial date.<br>
MARRIAGE: Listed as "unknown" by most sources, the ancestral file gave John's wife the name of Alice Smith.<br>
BIRTH: Ancestral file birthdate of 1575 was 3 years before the birth of her son, John, 5 years before Thomas was born, etc. Children were also born 17-36 years before Alice's marriage to Thomas. Therefore, abt. birthdate changed from 1773 to 1560, and MARRIAGE date changed to allow for children's births. It is possible the file dates were correct, and Alice Smith is not the correct mother of these children.<br>
