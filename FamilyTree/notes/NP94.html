A lifelong South Blue Hill resident, Helen was born Dec. 4, 1919, the daughter of Irving Collins and Gertrude (Henderson) Collins. Helen attended school in South Blue Hill and was a graduate of George Stevens Academy. She and her beloved husband, John Sylvester, were married in 1939. A few years later she accompanied her husband to North Carolina, where many of the local men went for work and to help the war effort. Helen and her husband moved back to South Blue Hill to raise their family. In her early married years she baked for local stores and became known for her elaborate wedding cakes, which she continued to make until a few years ago. Her full-time baking job gave way to a secretarial job at Merle B. Grindle Agency, Blue Hill, from where she eventually retired. Helen was well known for her watercolor art and many of her paintings can be found in local homes, galleries and antique stores. She made her own greeting cards from pressed flowers that are still prized possessions of their recipients. Her art and hand painted Christmas ornaments were annual blue ribbon winners at the Blue Hill Fair. She was a much sought after resource when it came to the history of South Blue Hill and Long Island. She was a descendant of the Henderson family on Long Island and was the keeper of many photographs and letters that she generously made available to whoever was interested. Helen had recently started writing children始s stories and hymns. Her book, "Yellow Boatie" was published in 2008 and she was working on two more stories at the time of her death. Helen is survived by her two daughters, Betty Pickering and her husband, Stephen, of Blue Hill and Martha Condon and her husband, Philip, of Brooksville; her grandchildren, David Gray and his wife, Margie, of South Blue Hill, Mark Gray and his wife, Kelle, of Orland, Jeffrey Gray and his wife, Donna, of South Blue Hill, Michelle Wassink and her husband, Robert, of Brooksville and Derrick Condon and his wife, Kim, of Clare, Mich.; great-grandchildren, Christopher Gray and friend, Charlene Spindler, Ricky Lymburner, Taylor Gray, Erin Gray and friend, Adam Jordan, Patrick Gray, Logan Condon and Helena Condon; her sister, Wilma Wheeler and her daughters, Karen Wheeler and husband, Elpie Flores, and Gail Wheeler of Rio Rancho, N.M.; her sister-in-law, Connie Collins of Bucksport; nephew, Sage Collins and his wife, Alexis, of Blue Hill; niece, Autumn Collins and husband, Bill Rhoads, of Florida; and a stepgrandson, Andrew Pickering of Blue Hill and his two brothers, Thomas and his fiancee, Jamie Weatherbee, and their children, Sara, Emma, Mara, Layla and Ridge of Sedgwick, and Christopher and his wife, Samantha, and their children, Alexandra and Connor of Brooklin. Helen was predeceased by her husband of 53 years, John Sylvester; her brothers, Harvard, Waldo and Albert Collins; a nephew, Stuart Collins; a great-granddaughter, Cori Gray and Cori始s mother, Virginia Smith Gray; and sister-in-law, Dorothy Condon and husband, Robert Condon. The family is very thankful to all of Helen始s friends and neighbors who have been so thoughtful and helpful to her through the years. You made her life complete and she loved you all dearly.

Alexius I COMNENUS
<p>
<a name ="I015534"><b>[I015534]</b></a><br />
Frrom Wikepedia<br>
<br>
Alexius I (1048-August 15, 1118), Byzantine emperor (1081-1118), was the third son of John Comnenus, the nephew of Isaac I Comnenus (emperor 1057-1059).<br>
<br>
His father declined the throne on the abdication of Isaac, who was accordingly succeeded by four emperors of other families between 1059 and 1081. Under one of these emperors, Romanus IV Diogenes (1067-1071), he served with distinction against the Seljuk Turks. Under Michael VII Parapinaces (1071-1078) and Nicephorus III Botaniates (1078-1081) he was also employed, along with his elder brother Isaac, against rebels in Asia Minor, Thrace and in Epirus in 1071.<br>
<br>
The success of the Comneni roused the jealousy of Botaniates and his ministers, and the Comneni were almost compelled to take up arms in self-defence. Botaniates was forced to abdicate and retire to a monastery, and Isaac declined the crown in favour of his younger brother Alexius, who then became emperor at the age of 33.<br>
<br>
By that time Alexius was the lover of the Empress Maria of Alania, an Alan princess from the Caucasus who was successively married to Michael VII Ducas and his successor Botaniates, and was renowned for her beauty. Alexius and Maria lived almost openly together at the Palace of Mangana, and Alexius had Michael VII and Maria's young son, the prince Constantine Ducas, adopted and proclaimed heir to the throne. The affair conferred to Alexius a degree of dynastic legitimacy, but soon his mother Anna Dalassena consolidated the Ducas family connection by arranging the Emperor's wedding with Irene Ducaena or Doukaina, granddaughter of the caesar John Ducas, head of a powerful feudal family and the "kingmaker" behind Michael VII.<br>
<br>
Alexius' involvement with Maria continued and shortly after his daughter Anna Comnena was born, she was betrothed to Constantine Ducas and moved to live at the Mangana Palace with him and Maria. The situation however changed drastically when John II Comnenus was born: Anna's engagement to Constantine was dissolved, she was moved to the main Palace to live with her mother and grandmother, Constantine's status as heir was terminated and Alexius became estranged with Maria, now stripped of her imperial title. Shortly afterwards, the teenager Constantine died and Maria was confined to a convent.<br>
<br>
Alexius' long reign of nearly 37 years was full of struggle. At the very outset he had to meet the formidable attack of the Normans (Robert Guiscard and his son Bohemund), who took Dyrrhachium and Corfu, and laid siege to Larissa in Thessaly (see Battle of Dyrrhachium). The Norman danger ended for the time with Robert Guiscard's death in 1085, and the conquests were reversed.<br>
<br>
He had next to repel the invasions of Pechenegs and Cumans in Thrace, with whom the Manichaean sect of the Bogomils made common cause; and thirdly, he had to cope with the fast-growing power of the Seljuk Turks in Asia Minor.<br>
<br>
Above all he had to meet the difficulties caused by the arrival of the knights of the First Crusade, which had been, to a great degree, initiated as the result of the representations of his own ambassadors, whom he had sent to Pope Urban II at the Council of Piacenza in 1095. The help which he wanted from the West was simply mercenary forces and not the immense hosts which arrived, to his consternation and embarrassment. The first group, under Peter the Hermit, he dealt with by sending them on to Asia Minor, where they were massacred by the Turks in 1096.<br>
<br>
The second and much more serious host of knights, led by Godfrey of Bouillon, he also led into Asia, promising to supply them with provisions in return for an oath of homage, and by their victories recovered for the Byzantine Empire a number of important cities and islands-Nicaea, Chios, Rhodes, Smyrna, Ephesus, Philadelphia, Sardis, and in fact most of Asia Minor (1097-1099). This is ascribed by his daughter Anna as a credit to his policy and diplomacy, but by the Latin historians of the crusade as a sign of his treachery and falseness. The crusaders believed their oaths were made invalid when Alexius did not help them during the siege of Antioch; Bohemund, who had set himself up as Prince of Antioch, briefly went to war with Alexius, but agreed to become Alexius' vassal under the Treaty of Devol in 1108.<br>
<br>
During the last twenty years of his life he lost much of his popularity. The years were marked by persecution of the followers of the Paulician and Bogomil heresies-one of his last acts was to burn Basilius, a Bogomil leader, with whom he had engaged in a theological controversy; by renewed struggles with the Turks (1110-1117); and by anxieties as to the succession, which his wife Irene wished to alter in favour of her daughter Anna's husband, Nicephorus Bryennius, for whose benefit the special title panhypersebastos ("honored above all") was created. This intrigue disturbed even his dying hours.<br>
<br>
Alexius was for many years under the strong influence of an eminence grise, his mother Anna Dalassena, a wise and immensely able politician whom, in a uniquely irregular fashion, he had crowned as Empress Augusta instead of the rightful claimant to the title, his wife Irene. Dalassena was the effective administrator of the Empire during Alexius' long absences in war campaigns: she was constantly at odds with her daughter-in-law and had assumed total responsibility for the upbringing and education of her granddaughter Anna Comnena.<br>
</p>
Andronicus I COMNENUS
<p>
<a name ="I015165"><b>[I015165]</b></a><br />
Andronicus I Comnenus (c.1118-1185), Byzantine emperor, son of prince Isaac Comnenus, and grandson of Alexius I Comnenus, was born about the beginning of the 12th century. His birth has been estimated to c. 1118. He was endowed by nature with the most remarkable gifts both of mind and body. He was handsome and eloquent, but licentious; and at the same time active, hardy, courageous, a great general and an able politician.<br>
<br>
Andronicus' early years were spent in alternate pleasure and military service. In 1141 he was taken captive by the Seljuk Turks and remained in their hands for a year. On being ransomed he went to Constantinople, where was held the court of his cousin, the emperor Manuel, with whom he was a great favourite. Here the charms of his niece, the princess Eudoxia, attracted him. She became his mistress, while her sister Theodora stood in a similar relation to the emperor Manuel.<br>
<br>
In 1152, accompanied by Eudoxia, he set out for an important command in Cilicia. Failing in his principal enterprise, an attack upon Mopsuestia, he returned, but was again appointed to the command of a province. This second post he seems also to have left after a short interval, for he appeared again in Constantinople, and narrowly escaped death at the hands of the brothers of Eudoxia.<br>
<br>
About this time (1153) a conspiracy against the emperor, in which Andronicus participated, was discovered and he was thrown into prison. There he remained for about twelve years, during which time he made repeated but unsuccessful attempts to escape. At last, in 1165, he was successful; and, after passing through many dangers, reached the court of Yaroslav, grand prince of Ruthenia, at Kyiv. While under the protection of the grand prince, Andronicus brought about an alliance between him and the emperor Manuel, and so restored himself to the emperor's favour. With a Russian army he joined Manuel in the invasion of Hungary and assisted at the siege of Semlin.<br>
<br>
After a successful campaign Manuel and Andronicus returned together to Constantinople (1168); but a year after, Andronicus refused to take the oath of allegiance to the prince of Hungary, whom Manuel desired to become his successor. He was removed from court, but received the province of Cilicia.<br>
<br>
Being still under the displeasure of the emperor, Andronicus fled to the court of Raymond, prince of Antioch. While residing here he captivated and seduced the beautiful daughter of the prince, Philippa, sister of the empress Maria. The anger of the emperor was again roused by this dishonour, and Andronicus was compelled to flee.<br>
<br>
He took refuge with Amalric I of Jerusalem, whose favour he gained, and who invested him with the Lordship of Beirut. In Jerusalem he saw Theodora, the beautiful widow of the late King Baldwin III and niece of the emperor Manuel. Although Andronicus was at that time fifty-six years old, age had not diminished his charms, and Theodora became the next victim of his artful seduction. To avoid the vengeance of the Emperor, she fled with Andronicus to the court of the Sultan of Damascus; but not deeming themselves safe there, they continued their perilous journey through Persia and Turkestan, round the Caspian Sea and across Mount Caucasus, until at length they settled in the ancestral lands of the Comneni at Oinaion, on the shores of the Black Sea, between Trebizond and Sinope.<br>
<br>
While Andronicus was on one of his incursions, his castle was surprised by the governor of Trebizond, and Theodora with her two children were captured and sent to Constantinople. To obtain their release Andronicus made abject submission to the Emperor and, appearing in chains before him, implored pardon. This he obtained, and was allowed to retire with Theodora into banishment at Oinaion.<br>
<br>
In 1180 the emperor Manuel died, and was succeeded by his son Alexius II Comnenus, who was under the guardianship of the empress Maria. Her conduct excited popular indignation, and the consequent disorders, amounting almost to civil war, gave an opportunity to the ambition of Andronicus. He left his retirement, secured the support of the army and marched upon Constantinople, where his advent was stained by a cruel massacre of the Latin inhabitants, which was focused on the Venetian merchants who virtually controlled the economy of the city. Alexius was compelled to acknowledge him as colleague in the empire, but was soon put to death.<br>
<br>
Andronicus, now (1183) sole emperor, married Agnes of France, widow of Alexius II and a child twelve years of age. Agnes was a daughter of Louis VII of France and his third wife Ad猫le of Champagne.<br>
<br>
His short reign was characterized by strong and wise measures. He resolved to suppress many abuses, but, above all things, to check feudalism and limit the power of the nobles. The people, who felt the severity of his laws, at the same time acknowledged their justice, and found themselves protected from the rapacity of their superiors. The aristocrats, however, were infuriated against him, and summoned to their aid William II of Sicily. This prince landed in Epirus with a strong force, and marched as far as Thessalonica, which he took and destroyed; but he was shortly afterwards defeated, and compelled to return to Sicily.<br>
<br>
Andronicus seems then to have resolved to exterminate the aristocracy, and his plans were nearly crowned with success. But in 1185, during his absence from the capital, his lieutenant ordered the arrest and execution of Isaac Angelus, a descendant of the first Alexius. Isaac escaped and took refuge in the church of Hagia Sophia. He appealed to the populace, and a tumult arose which spread rapidly over the whole city. When Andronicus arrived he found that his power was overthrown, and that Isaac had been proclaimed emperor. Isaac delivered him over to his enemies, and for three days he was exposed to their fury and resentment. At last they hung him up by the feet between two pillars. His dying agonies were shortened by an Italian soldier, who mercifully plunged a sword into his body. He died on September 12, 1185. Andronicus was the last of the Comneni to rule Constantinople, althugh his grandsons Alexius I of Trebizond and his brother David founded the Empire of Trebizond in 1204.<br>

John III COMYN
<p>
<a name ="I012575"><b>[I012575]</b></a><br />
In 1306, the titular King of Scotland was John Baliol, a 'lamb among wolves' who had achieved the throne through the backing of Edward of England and John Comyn of Badenoch, head of the most powerful family in Scotland at that time. Baliol had fled to France with no intention of returning, leaving Scotland virtually kingless. Robert the Bruce had seemingly started planning his rising in 1304, but everything hinged upon the support of John Comyn, a difficult person: the Red comyn must either support Bruce or be dead. The climax came in 1306, when Bruce met the Comyn in Greyfriars church in Dumfries. As they stoodbefore the alter and argued, knives were drawn, and John Comyn fell wounded. According to legend, Bruce ran out of the church crying 'I doubt I have slain the Red Comyn'. Kilpatrick answered his "Do you so doubt? Then I'll mak siccar', and rushed into the church followed by Sir Robert Boyd and finished the job. Legendary as this may be, the fact is that both John Comyn of Badenoch and Sir Robert Comyn were both killed.<br>

Mr. O.P. Congdon<br>
We record this week the death of Mr. Owen P. Congdon, which occurred at his home in Somerset on Saturday afternoon. Mr. Congdon has been in failing health for some years but his indomitable resolution has led him, under most adverse circumstances, to attend constantly to the active duties of life, and his final illness was but of a few hours duration.<br>
Mr. Congdon was a man of excellent character. He was born in 1872 at Union Square. When he was a boy his parents removed to Somerset, where the greater part of his life has been spent. He married Della, a daughter of Mr. T.A. Neily, of Middleton, who is now left a widow with three children. They have the sincere sympathy of all who know them.<br>
