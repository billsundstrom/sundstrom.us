FRANK SEARS DEAD<br>
Under the above heading the Webster, S. Dakota Reporter and Farmer, under the date of June 1, brings the belated and sorrowful news of the death of a former Chatsworth boy, son of Squire W.W. Sears, for years a resident of Chatsworth, which occurred on Decoration Day. A copy of the paper was received by L.J. Haberkorn. The following is the Reporter and Farmer article:<br>
"This will be sad news indeed to the people of Day county. He was a friend to all. He was one of those great big fellows, who by his ability and magnetism made himself loved by all. He was a friend so close that no man ever had a better one. His disposition was so open that he took the whole world into his confidence. For him there were no rich, nor no poor. He was one among them all. To him all were alike--good fellows, a part of his life. As a lawyer, with natural ability, he had no superior. As a citizen, no community ever admitted a better one. He was in for all improvements and advancements. His time, ability and energy were freely given. In his home life he was the most indulgent of husbands and most loving of fathers. He came to us in 1884. He located in Andover. the profession of law appealed to him. He began its study. At that time not even he knew the natural ability with which God had endowed him. He had nothing but a common school education to begin with. Think of it. Yet he made himself master of the circumstances which confronted him--circumstances which would have made a weaker man quail and quake with fear and decide upon some other vocation. All his energies were devoted to perfecting himself. His life was given to the study of the practice and methods. No man was ever endowed with a more resourceful brain. To him there were always many pivots upon which a case might turn. He reasoned them all and had for each an argument. He loved mankind. That is what made him the great jury lawyer, which, he was admitted by all to have been. He knew the weak spots and the strong attachments; he appreciated and saw the jealousies and the prejudices--good and bad. No man ever lived who knew men better than he nor knew better how to mix with them. He was at home with all classes. He could place himself in the other fellow's position and knew how to approach him. He has gone to his reward. Peace be to his ashes. May Divine Providence look after those whom he loved who are left to mourn. God comfort them with the thought that he never intentionally did a wrong and thousands of eyes are moist and thousands of hearts ache today because of his demise.<br>
Frank Sears was born to William and Margaret Sears at Moscow, New York, July 1856. The family moved to Livingston, Ill., in 1857, where his younger days were spent. He graduated from the Chatsworth, Ill. high school in 1875. After leaving the Chatsworth school he attended a German school for three years and became quite fluent in that language. At the close of his school days he entered the employ of the Illinois Midland railroad and rose to the position of conductor. In 1884, when the whole country was looking westward, he took Horace Greely's advice, "Go west, young man, and grow up with the country." and came to Dakota, locating near Andover. He began the study of law and in 1888 was upon examination admitted to practice. In 1890 he was elected as the first mayor of Webster. The people again in 1904 called him as state's attorney and again in 1906.<br>
The deceased was married in June, 1881, to Miss Isabelle Hammond, at Pekin, Ill. To this union was born four children, all of whom survive. Mrs. Mayme O'Reagen, of St. Paul; Wm. Wallace Sears, of Mobridge, S.D.; Frank Sears, of Marquette, Mich.; Mrs. Harry E. Wells, of St. Paul.<br>
On October 27, 1901, he was married to Miss Alice Cavanagh, who with her two children, Barnabas and Evelyn, survive him.<br>
Frank Sears went to Aberdeen last Wednesday to try a case and while there was taken ill with pneumonia. Sunday night he had sufficiently recovered to permit his return to this city. During the night he was taken much worse and in spite of the best medical assistance died on Tuesday at 12:20.<br>
The funeral services will be held from the family residence at 2 o'clock Friday afternoon. <br>
The Chatsworth Plaindealer, 23 June 1911<br>
------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
FRANK SEARS, a leading member of the bar of Day County, and a prominent citizen of Webster, the county seat, was born July 18, 1856, at Moscow, Livingston County, New York. He is the son of William and Margaret A. (Poorman) Sears, both natives of New York State, the former born in Livingston County in 1828 and the latter in Seneca county in 1833.The Sears are of English descent. The grandparents (paternal) were Franklin and Elizabeth (Shadders) Sears, the former born in Massachusetts and the latter in Hagerstown, Maryland. William Sears, the father, removed from Livingston county, New York, to Woodford county, Illinois, in 1857, and from there he removed to Chatsworth, Livingston, Illinois, in 1866. He is a lawyer by profession and has held local public office for many years. He and wife are still living. The mother of the subject is the daughter of Jacob Poorman.<br>
Frank Sears was reared in Chatsworth, Illinois. He graduated from the Chatsworth high school in 1875, following which he attended German school for three years, becoming a fluent writer and talker in that language. Following his schooling, he spent four years in the service of the Illinois Midland Railroad Company. In 1884 he came to Andover, Day County, South Dakota, where he took up the study of law. In November 1888, he was admitted to the bar, and in 1890 he was elected state's attorney for Day County. He removed to Webster, where he assumed the duties of his office. He was re-elected state's attorney in 1892. In April 1805 he was elected the first mayor of Webster. In1904 he was re-nominated for state's attorney by the Republican Party. He has been prominent in legal circles for fifteen years, and has been connected with the most important cases in this section of the state. He makes a specialty of criminal practice. He belongs to the Knights of Pythias, Independent Order of Odd Fellows Improved Order of Red Men and Dramatic Order Knights of Khorassan. He is a self-made man in every respect.<br>
In June, 188I, Mr. Sears was married, at Pekin, Tazewell County, Illinois, to Isabell Hammond, the daughter of Daniel Hammond. The following four children were born to that union: Mayme, married to Frank J. OÊ¼Regan, of St. Paul; William Wallace, now of St. Paul; Frank, Jr., now of St. Paul; Madaline, of St. Paul. On October 27,1901, Mr. Sears was married to Miss Alice Cavanaugh, who was born at McComb, Illinois, the daughter of John Cavanaugh. To them two children have been born Barnabus and a daughter, unnamed.<br>

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
Frank sears was a talented, versatile, resourceful, lusty, warm and loving rascal of a man who rose to the highest local offices and lived life to the hilt. He loved baseball and as a boy was a crackerjack athlete. He loved hunting and as a young man in Chatsworth, Illinois supplied the neighbors with many duck feather pillows. He like horses and had thoroughbreds, trotters and pacers, which he liked to race, often when drunk, the story goes how the wives of the town of Webster would shut their shades and shutters to keep out the dust as he pounded down main street. His buggy pulled by a black horse, glittering in the sunshine and the envy of many. He often wore shiny black boots and was a flamboyant, strong man who wore a diamond stickpin, sometimes a flash vest, an impressive watch fob, and always arose in his lapel. He loved most of all women, including indian squaws, and whisky.<br>
As a defense lawyer he was admitted to the practice of law on November 14, 1888 with the firm Sears and Potter; tried many leading cases in criminal law not only in the state, but elsewhere. One famous one was a murder case (the State vs. Jacobs, an indian). He was counsel for the defense and won both the case and the love of the nearby Indian tribe. He tried many boundary line cases and was the divisional counsel for the Milwaukee railroad for many years.<br>
He not only mastered the German language, but was attorney for the Dakota-Sioux Indians at Sisseton and spoke their language.<br>
One interesting anecdote tells how he used a trick said to have been used by Clarence Darrow at a law trial. He would light a trick cigar when the complainant lawyer was in rebuttal. It had a wire running through it and there he would sit listening respectfully while the jury was distracted worrying when the ash would drop off instead of following the attorney's statement. The stories about him are myriad as they commonly are for a political figure.<br>
Frank remarried Alice Evelyn Cavanaugh who was 20 years younger than he. Frank passed away in the prime of life aged 54 not yet at the pinnacle of his career. He contracted pneumonia and against the advice of his doctor continued his law practice. On the way to make a patriotic speech on Memorial Day, May 30, 1911, he died. As a past chancellor of the Knights of Pythias he was beloved by his peers and friends everywhere. They voted to declare a thirty-day period of mourning.<br>

TULLY -- Myrtha A. (Sedgwick) Gale, 98, of 93 Royalston Road, died late Sunday evening, November 13, 2011 at Quabbin Valley Healthcare in Athol, following an illness.<br>
Born on February 19, 1913 in Jaffrey, New Hampshire, she was a daughter of Louis and Lena Sedgwick, and grew up in Fitchburg, graduating from Fitchburg High School in 1931. She moved to Tully in 1932 at the age of 19 with her parents, coming from Fitchburg and has been involved in the community ever since.<br>
Myrtha was married to David M. Gale at the Community Church of North Orange and Tully when she was just 22 years old and had enjoyed 50 years of marriage at the time of David's death on October 15, 1984.<br>
For 53 Years, Myrtha served as the librarian of the Moore-Leland Library in North Orange. She first started at the former Gale Brooks School, where she also had been a substitute teacher. During her tenure at the library, she cherished her time with the school children who came over weekly for reading hour from Gale Brooks. During the summer, the library hosted a reading club with prizes and a party at the conclusion. Adults using the library were greeted warmly as the children and became a meeting place of the North Orange community. She and the late Rose Taylor worked together in unison helping the patrons find the latest novel or facts for term papers. Myrtha retired from the library in 1996.<br>
Myrtha also was a teacher's aide at the Tully School for grades 1-8, while her husband David was the janitor.<br>
Not only a member of the Community Church of North Orange and Tully, Myrtha took an active role in many of the church functions, including the monthly suppers, the annual church fair in August, and the Holly Fair in November.<br>
She made many baked treats and numerous pounds of fudge and found much enjoyment working with her sister in law and friend of over 68 years, the late Norma Johnson, in all these events together. Besides cooking and baking, Myrtha's involvement in the church ladies' Dorcas Society resulted in many hand crafted hats, mittens, blankets, and quilts which have been treasured by many families in the area.<br>
Myrtha was also a member of the North Orange Grange for 70 years, having served on many committees. She also belonged to the I Wunder What Club, Orange Women's Club, Jolly Circle, and the Western Mass Library Club.<br>
Not to be out done by her husband and son's involvement in fire service, Myrtha had been a member of the Orange Fire Department and Tully Fire Station Ladies' Auxiliary and helped provide refreshments to the firemen during major fires, the children's Christmas party, and the Memorial Day parade. Myrtha was also on the fire department's "red phone" system when fires were reported directly to the Tully station. She was proud to see the new Tully Fire Station completed in 2010, though bittersweet that the trucks would not be directly across from her home in Tully Center.<br>
In 2003, Myrtha celebrated her 90th birthday party at the Community Church with over 200 family and friends celebrating her remarkable life. Every Halloween, all the children would look forward to her homemade popcorn balls, which she shared with a few lucky adults as well. Myrtha's affection and kindness to all will be missed by everyone, but especially by her devoted family.<br>
Survivors include her son, C. David Gale and his wife, Pamela, of North Orange; a granddaughter, Jessica Gale-Tanner and her husband, Benjamin, of Tully; a great grandson, Cory Tanner of Tully; nephews, Wayne Johnson and his wife, Virginia, Ward Johnson, Donald Fuller and his wife, Joanne, and David M. (Jim) Sedgwick; nieces, Gayle Metevia and her husband Paul, Lynda and Kate Sedgwick, Susan Kivi and her husband John, and Mary Jo Hood and her husband Gerald; extended family and numerous friends.<br>

Harold W. "Hal" Seeley age 92 of California<br>
Another of BakerÊ¼s hometown boys is gone. Harold "Hal" Seeley, a man who lived long and graciously. So much so, any man would have been proud to fill his shoes in any of his journeys throughout his 92 years. In 1925 born to Frank and Vera Seeley he grew up with his siblings Nelson, Robert, Gwendolyn, Zetta and Gordon in Baker. Following childhood at the tender age of 17 Harold joined the USN making it a carrier of pride and honor.<br>
He married and helped raise two daughters of which he loved deeply. He helped give them the skills and education to do well in life making him a lifelong Trojan fan along the way. Late in life he was given the chance to do it all again when he met his best friend and forever soul mate. They married and spent the next 30 years 24/7 together. Following many travels and too many adventures to name, he passed peacefully holding his wifeÊ¼s hand with an ocean breeze gently flowing in, watching the waves as they broke slowly to the shoreline.<br>
Knowing he was loved by many and will never be forgotten. Our reality beats any dream. May he live forever in our hearts. Fulfilling his final wishes, he is to return home one last time to Montana with services being held April 27, 2018 in Helena where he will be laid to rest with military honors.<br>
A Funeral service will be held on Friday, April 27th at 9:30 a.m. at Anderson Stevenson Wilke Funeral home, 3750 N. Montana Ave. A graveside service will immediately follow at Montana State Veterans cemetery. A reception will follow the service at the Fort Harrison Service Club.<br>
