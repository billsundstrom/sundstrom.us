Gloria Theresa NARDIELLO
<p>
<a name ="I070660"><b>[I070660]</b></a><br />
Gloria Theresa (Nardiello) Zuchegna, 89, of Winsted, formerly of New York, NY, passed away peacefully at Hartford Hospital with family by her side on February 8, 2013. She was the daughter of the late Giuseppe and Asunta Nardiello. Born on June 27, 1923, she was the youngest of the first American generation of Italian immigrants in New York City. She married George Zuchegna in 1956. Upon arriving in Connecticut in 1972, she never looked back, as she grew to love Winsted and the many loyal friends she made here. She worked at Highland Acres Convalescent Home as bookkeeper and administrative assistant for 19 years, where she made many dear, life-long friends. Upon retiring in 1993, she then devoted herself to her favorite hobby: reading, and later to her newly arriving grandchildren. She was a member of the Mystery Book Club at the Beardsley Library right up until her passing, and was a Volunteer Mentor at Hinsdale School for several years, spending lunchtime reading to children. Gloria was a devout Catholic, faithfully saying her Rosary, attending Sunday Mass, and watching daily Mass on television. She was predeceased by a son, Peter, and by her six siblings (Guido, Danny, Vincent, Antoinette, Linda, and Lucia). She had the most wonderful sense of humor, and her smile brightened every room she entered. She leaves behind her loving family-son Alan Joseph Zuchegna of Winsted, daughter Teresa Lovejoy and Son-in-law John Lovejoy of New Hartford, and grandchildren Jacqueline, Elijah, and William Lovejoy of New Hartford. We all miss her so much already. <br>

Toda of NAVARRE
<p>
<a name ="I030929"><b>[I030929]</b></a><br />
Toda Aznárez, also Teuda de Larraun or Tota (c. 885-aft. 970), was the queen-consort of Pamplona through her marriage to Sancho I, who reigned 905-925, and was regent of Pamplona, 931-934.<br>
She was the daughter of Aznar Sánchez, lord of Larraun, paternal grandson of king Garcı́a Íñiguez of Pamplona, while her mother Onneca Fortúnez was a daughter of king Fortún Garcés. Thus, Toda's children were also descendants of the Arista dynasty of Navarrese monarchs. She was sister of Sancha Aznárez, wife of king Jimeno Garcés, her husband's brother and successor, while Toda and Sancha were also aunts of Caliph Abd-ar-Rahman III, through their mother's first marriage to ʻAbdullah ibn Muhammad.<br>
With the death of her brother-in-law Jimeno in 931, she became regent and guardian for her young son, Garcı́a Sánchez I. In 934 Toda signed a treaty pledging allegiance to her nephew Abd-ar-Rahman III, and released hostages of the Banu Di n-Nun clan, the caliph confirming the rule of her son Garcı́a (this has sometimes been interpreted as an act of the Caliph to liberate Garcı́a from his mother's direct control). This led to the rebellion in Falces by a count Fortún Garcés, an "irascible man who hated Muslims", the uprising being suppressed with Cordoban arms. Toda violated her treaty in 937, forcing a punitive campaign. She had been an energetic diplomat, arranging political marriages for her daughters among the competing royalty and nobility of Christian Iberia.<br>
The Codex of Roda gives Sancho and Toda six children:<br>
    * Oneca (d. 931), married Alfonso IV the Monk of León in 926<br>
    * Sancha, married firstly Ordoño II of León, secondly Count Alvaro Herraméliz of Álava, and thirdly Fernán González, Count of Castile<br>
    * Urraca, married Ramiro II of León<br>
    * Velasquita (or Belasquita), married firstly Munio, count of Vizcaya, secondly Galindo, son of Bernard count of Ribagorza, and thirdly Fortún Galı́ndez, duke of Nájera.<br>
    * Orbita<br>
    * Garcı́a, king of Pamplona<br>
