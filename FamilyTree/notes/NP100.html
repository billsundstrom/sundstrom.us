Helen Genevieve CORCORAN
<p>
<a name ="I090307"><b>[I090307]</b></a><br />
Helen Genevieve Corcoran O'Brien, 87, of Wethersfield, and formerly of Hartford, surrendered herself onto our Lord, Jesus Christ, and His promise of Eternal Life on Monday, (April 13, 2009), surrounded by her loving family at St. Francis Hospital & Medical Center, Hartford after a long and courageous battle against many serious complications arising from a fall and broken leg last September. She was married for 46 joyous years to the love of her life, John Francis O'Brien, who devoted 40 years to the Conn. State Police and retired as a Major in 1978 and predeceased her in 1998. They are surely reunited now dancing across the stars in Heaven. Helen and John shared a beautiful marriage entirely devoted to each other and their family. She was the most wonderful wife, greatest homemaker and the world's best mother, grandmother, sister, cousin, aunt and friend. She is survived by four adoring, proud and grateful sons, Attorney John F. O'Brien and his wife, Jennifer and their daughter, Grace Genevieve, stepdaughter Jillian Grande and stepson Jared Grande all of Manchester and his other children, Emilee Helen and Colin O'Brien of Columbia; Mark E. O'Brien of Wethersfield; David A. O'Brien and his wife, Constanza Paramo and their daughter, Gabriela of Bloomfield; and Gregory J. O'Brien of New Hartford and many beloved nieces and nephews and hundreds of friends and people whom she touched with her love, faith, compassion and generosity over her many fulfilled years. Helen was born and raised in Hartford's Barry Square neighborhood as the fifth of ten children of Francis and Mary Daly Corcoran. She was predeceased by all of her nine beloved siblings, Molly C. Firnhaber of Hartford, John Corcoran of Orange, CA, Richard "Pat" Corcoran of Hartford, Irene C. Slusarczyk of Glastonbury, Thomas Corcoran of Oxnard, CA, Rita C. Vicino of West Hartford, Raymond Corcoran of Mansfield Center, Walter Corcoran of West Hartford and Robert Corcoran of Wethersfield, who, like her, strove to make the world a better place. Their common Corcoran goodness and spirited love of music and family lives on in their many children and grandchildren across the United States. A very devout and pious Catholic, Helen was a daily communicant and very active in parish affairs at St. Augustine Church until her move to Wethersfield and the Church of the Incarnation in 2005. She was a lay leader of the Hartford chapter of the Carmelite Order, a religious group devoted to charitable work in the name of our Holy Mother Mary. She taught catechism to the children at St. Augustine School for many years. Helen devoted great love and energy to raise donations of funds, food, clothing and other necessities for the disadvantaged of Hartford and across the globe with special efforts for refugee families who settled locally. Helen also spent many hours working in the trenches and pounding the streets to help elect good people to all levels of government. She was selfless and tireless in her commitment to her family, friends and community and would do anything for anyone in need at any time. No one she knew ever missed a doctor's visit or church event because she was always driving scores of "older folks" to them. The warmth of her heart was matched by the brightness of her smile and she freely bestowed her happiness, optimism, wit and wisdom to all. She constantly gave of herself to her family and anyone in need. In lieu of flowers, Helen requested that donations to charities aiding the poor and especially children be made in honor of her exemplary work. She was also very supportive of the Holy Apostle College and Seminary in Cromwell. Memorial donations in her name for the seminary may be sent to the Very Reverend Douglas L. Mosey, President & Rector, Holy Apostle College and Seminary, 33 Prospect Hill Road, Cromwell, CT 06416. Calling hours with the family in the Farley-Sullivan Funeral Home at 34 Beaver Rd., Wethersfield will be held TODAY, Thursday, April 16, 1-4 p.m. and 6-8 p.m. Funeral Services will be held Friday, April 17, at 9 a.m. from the Farley-Sullivan Funeral home followed by a Mass of Christian Burial celebrating Helen's life at 10 a.m., in the Church of The Incarnation, 544 Prospect Street, Wethersfield.

<p>
<a name ="I006187"><b>[I006187]</b></a><br />
Scotts Bay.<br>
The death occurred at Scott ºs Bay on May 16th last of Noble Corkum, aged 53 years. Deceased was born in Pereaux. He was converted eighteen years ago and joined the Baptist church at that place, of which the Rev. David Freeman was, at that time pastor. He had for six years been afflicted with asthma which at last developed into consumption. During the latter part of his sickness he suffered very much, but bore it all with Christian fortitude. His daughter Carrie who had been living in Portland, ME, came home April 1st and cared for her father during the remainder of his illness. His son Burton, who was also in Maine, arrived home only two days before his father ºs death. The day before he died he requested the family to sing "Life is the time to serve the Lord," and "On Christ, the Solid Rock, I Stand." He listened throughout with rapt attention, murmuring at the close, "Oh, how blessed!" The funeral took place on Sunday, 18th. The remains were taken into the church at Scotts Bay, where a touching and impressive service was conducted by Rev. Allen Corbett. After the sorrowing relatives and friends had taken their farewell look at the remains, the interment took place in Scotts Bay cemetery. The funeral was largely attended, more than fifty carriages following the remains to the church. Deceased leaves a widow, nine children, and aged father and mother, one sister and five brothers to mourn their loss. While deepest sympathy is felt for the sorrowing family, we greatly rejoice with them that his sleep is in God.<br>
