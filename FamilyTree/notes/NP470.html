Alfonso VIII SANCHEZ
<p>
<a name ="I007532"><b>[I007532]</b></a><br />
From Wikipedia<br>
<br>
Alfonso VIII (November 11, 1155 - October 5, 1214), king of Castile and grandson of Alfonso VII, is a great name in Spanish history, for he led the coalition of Christian princes and foreign crusaders who broke the power of the Almohades at the battle of the Navas de Tolosa in 1212.<br>
<br>
His personal history is that of many medieval kings. He succeeded to the throne, in infancy, on the death of his father, Sancho. Though proclaimed king, he was regarded as a mere name by the unruly nobles to whom a minority was convenient. Also his mother was dead, thus he did not have closer relatives than his uncle Ferdinand, king of Leon, who wanted power in Castile. The devotion of a squire of his household, who carried him on the pommel of his saddle to the stronghold of San Esteban de Gormaz, saved him from falling into the hands of the contending factions of Castro and Lara, or of his uncle Ferdinand of León, who claimed the regency.<br>
<br>
The loyalty of the town of Ávila protected his youth. He was barely fifteen when he came forth to do a man's work by restoring his kingdom to order. It was only by a surprise that he recovered his capital Toledo from the hands of the Laras. His marriage with Eleanor of England (Sp: Leonora), daughter of Henry II of England and Eleanor of Aquitaine (Aquitaine having old ties with Castile), brought him under the influence of the greatest governing intellect of his time. Alfonso VIII was the founder of the first Spanish university, the studium generale of Palencia, which, however, did not survive him.<br>
<br>
During his reign, Castile annexed the province of Logroño.<br>
<br>
In 1176, Alfonso married Leonora of England and Aquitaine. They had 12 children:<br>
    * Berenguela, or Berenguaria, Queen of Castile (1180-1246), married to Conrad of Hohenstaufen, Duke of Swabia, and then to Alfonso IX, King of León; succeeded her brother, Henry I<br>
    * Sancho, prince of Castile (1181)<br>
    * Sancha, princess of Castile (1182-1184)<br>
    * Urraca, princess of Castile (1186-1220), married to Alfonso II of Portugal<br>
    * Blanche, a.k.a Blanche of Castile, princess of Castile (1188-1252), married to Louis VIII of France<br>
    * Ferdinand, prince of Castile (1189-1211)<br>
    * Mafalda, princess of Castile (1191-1204)<br>
    * Henry, prince of Castile (1192 - 1190s)<br>
    * Constance or Constanza, princess of Castile (1196 - late 1190s)<br>
    * Eleonor or Eleanor, princess of Castile (1202-1244), married to James I of Aragon<br>
    * Henry I of Castile (1204-1217) succeeded his father.<br>
    * Constance or Constanza, princess of Castile (?-1243), abbess of Las Huelgas<br>
</p>
Blanca Alphonsa SANCHEZ
<p>
<a name ="I007525"><b>[I007525]</b></a><br />
Blanche of Castile (1188-1252), wife of Louis VIII of France, third daughter of Alfonso VIII, king of Castile, and of Eleanor of England, daughter of Henry II, was born at Palencia.<br>
<br>
In consequence of a treaty between Philip Augustus and John of England, she was betrothed to the former's son, Louis, and was brought to France, in the spring of 1200, by John's mother Eleanor. On May 22, 1200 the treaty was finally signed, John ceding with his niece the fiefs of Issoudun and Gracay, together with those that André de Chavigny, lord of Châteauroux, held in Berry, of the English crown. The marriage was celebrated the next day, at Portmort on the right bank of the Seine, in John's domains, as those of Philip lay under an interdict.<br>
<br>
Blanche first displayed her great qualities in 1216, when Louis, who on the death of John claimed the English crown in her right, invaded England, only to find a united nation against him. Philip Augustus refused to help his son, and Blanche was his sole support. The queen established herself at Calais and organized two fleets, one of which was commanded by Eustace the Monk, and an army under Robert of Courtenay; but all her resolution and energy were in vain. Although it would seem that her masterful temper exercised a sensible influence upon her husband's gentler character, her role during his reign (1223-1226) is not well known. Upon his death he left Blanche regent and guardian of his children. Of her twelve or thirteen children, six had died, and Louis, the heir--afterwards the sainted Louis IX--was but twelve years old. The situation was critical, for the hard-won domains of the house of Capet seemed likely to fall to pieces during a minority. Blanche had to bear the whole burden of affairs alone, to break up a league of the barons (1226), and to repel the attack of the king of England (1230). But her energy and firmness overcame all dangers. There was an end to the calumnies circulated against her, based on the poetical homage rendered her by Theobald IV of Champagne, and the prolonged stay in Paris of the papal legate, Romano Bonaventura, cardinal of Sant' Angelo.<br>
<br>
The nobles were awed by her warlike preparations or won over by adroit diplomacy, and their league was broken up. St Louis owed his realm to his mother, but he himself always remained somewhat under the spell of her imperious personality. After he came of age (1236) her influence upon him may still be traced. In 1248 she again became regent, during Louis IX's absence on the crusade, a project which she had strongly opposed. In the disasters which followed she maintained peace, while draining the land of men and money to aid her son in the East. At last her strength failed her. She fell ill at Melun in November 1252, and was taken to Paris, but lived only a few days. She was buried at Maubuisson.<br>
