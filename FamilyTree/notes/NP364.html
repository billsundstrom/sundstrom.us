<h2>Notes</h2>
Creoda of MERCIA
<p>
<a name ="I005590"><b>[I005590]</b></a><br />
Creoda (or Crida) (c. 5401 - 593) was the first monarch of Mercia (c. 585 - 593).<br>
<br>
Creoda is recorded as having been the son of Cynewald, the grandson of Cnebba, and the great-grandson of Icel; consequently, members of the Mercian royal line were known as Iclingas. Although this suggests that Creoda was only a fourth-generation descendant of the first Angles in England, the sources nevertheless record him as having been the first ruler of the Kingdom of Mercia. One explanation for this is that the Mercians had initially settled further east and only moved into the area of what became known as Mercia in the time of Creoda.<br>
<br>
Like most of the early Anglo-Saxon kings, very little is known about his life. The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle records his death in the year 593.<br>
</p>
Leofric of MERCIA
<p>
<a name ="I004638"><b>[I004638]</b></a><br />
From Wikipedia<br>
<br>
Leofric (b. abt May 14, 968 - died August 31, 1057) was the Earl of Mercia, who, in 1043, founded monasterys at Coventry and Much Wenlock. Leofric is best remembered as the husband of Godiva, who is said to have ridden through the streets of Coventry naked, in order to persuade her husband to reduce the burden of taxes placed on their subjects by order of King Hardicanute. In the novel by Charles Kingsley, they were the parents of Hereward the Wake, but this is merely a literary device.<br>
<br>
He married in 1030. He is said to have died in Bromley, Staffordshire, England.<br>
<br>
His son, Alfgar, Earl Of Mercia, succeeded him.<br>
</p>
Pybba of MERCIA
<p>
<a name ="I005589"><b>[I005589]</b></a><br />
Pybba (570?-606/15) (also Pibba, Wibba, Wybba) was an early King of Mercia. He was the son of Creoda and father of Penda and Eowa.<br>
<br>
His dates are sometimes given in genealogies as birth in 570, the beginning of his reign in 593, and death in either 606 or 615, but with no apparent evidence; the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle just mentions him as father of Penda, with no further detail.<br>
<br>
Pybba, who is said by the Historia Brittonum to have had 12 sons, is also said to have been succeeded by Cearl, of unknown relationship. His son Penda eventually became king; the Chronicle gives the date of this as 626, although Bede suggests it was not until after the battle of Hatfield Chase in 633. Besides Penda and Eowa (who the author of the Historia Brittonum said were the sons of Pybba who were the best known to him), Pybba also apparently had a son named Coenwalh. Every king from Penda until Ceolwulf, who was deposed in 823, was said to be a descendant of Pybba, either through Penda, Eowa, or Coenwalh (perhaps excluding the short-lived Beornrad, whose background is unknown).<br>
</p>
Wiglaf of MERCIA
<p>
<a name ="I005578"><b>[I005578]</b></a><br />
Wiglaf (died 839/40) was the King of Mercia from 827 to 829 and again from 830 until his death. His rule coincided with the rise of the rival Anglo-Saxon kingdom of Wessex under Egbert.<br>
<br>
Wiglaf does not seem to have been a member of the traditional Mercian royal line, and it is unclear whether he had any relationship to it. He became king after his predecessor, Ludeca, was killed in a failed attempt to subjugate the rebellious East Anglians. At this time, Mercia was engaged in a conflict with the rising power of Wessex, which had begun during the reign of Beornwulf in 825, and in 829, Egbert of Wessex successfully invaded Mercia and drove Wiglaf from his throne.<br>
<br>
Historically speaking, this event marked the beginning of the domination of England by Wessex, but the Mercians regained their independence and brought Wiglaf back to power in the following year. It is unclear whether this was the result of a Mercian rebellion against West Saxon rule or a grant made by Egbert to a submissive Wiglaf; the 20th century historian Frank Stenton argued in his Anglo-Saxon History that the former is more likely, and cited a charter of 836 as evidence that Wiglaf was acting as an independent ruler at that time.<br>

</p>
Arthur Guy MERRILL
<p>
<a name ="I068103"><b>[I068103]</b></a><br />
Arthur G. Merrill was born May 31, 1872, in the town of Shelburne, the son of George G. and Emma Field Merrill. He was a graduate of Arms academy, and Williams college in 1894. During his course of study he specialized on modern languages, for which he had a great liking and aptitude, spending his summer vacations abroad in study. During the years immediately following his graduation from college, he taught in Tarrytown-on-the Hudson, in New Jersey, and other preparatory schools. In 1902 he became associated with the Francis W. Parker school in Chicago, as a teacher of modern languages; and there he died suddenly of meningitis, Nov. 1, 1919, while still in the zenith of his activity.<br>
Incorporated in Mr. Merrill's paper on his brother was a tribute by Raymond w. Osborne, an associate in the administration of the Parker school, which spoke in the highest terms of Arthur G. Merrill's service in the school, and his great influence for good upon the students and their regard for him.<br>
Mr. Merrill showed great interest in his family genealogy, spending a great deal of time and travel on compiling facts about it; and it was through this interest that he came to Deerfield, to see George Sheldon, the historian. At that time he became interested in the Pocumtuck Valley Memorial Association and became a member of it.<br>
It may be of interest to the members of the association to know that he was a descendant, on his father's line, of Martin Severance, the first settler in the town of Shelburne, who came there from Deerfield.<br>
He is survived by a widow, Louise Merrill of Chicago,<br>

Edward Wilson MERRILL
<p>
<a name ="I068131"><b>[I068131]</b></a><br />
Edward Wilson Merrill (born in New Bedford, MA on August 31, 1923) is one of the leading biomaterials scientist of the 20th century and one of the founders of bioengineering and specifically the biomedical engineering field within chemical engineering.[1] Merrill was born to Edward Clifton Merrill (1881-1949), a chemical engineer and chief chemist of the United Drug Company (Rexall) and Gertrude Wilson (1895-1978).<br>
Merrill grew up in Boston and attended the Roxbury Latin High school. He studied classics at Harvard. As Herman P. Meissner notes in his article "In appreciation",<br>
"Edward W. Merrill entered Harvard in 1941 to study the classics with emphasis on the contributions from the Greek authors. The faculty was delighted with his brilliant performance and recognized that they had a real scholar in the making. Merrill however felt that there were further aspects to life and reality than the humanities. He had always been interested in science, and so chose chemistry as a minor. At the time, Professor William H. McAdams of M.I.T. visited Harvard several days each week to present a rigorous and intensive course in Chemical Engineering basics. Ed Merrill enrolled, contrary to the advice of the more sophisticated undergrads, whose gentlest description of the subject was "formidable"."<br>
He received a B.A. in Chemistry from Harvard University in 1944 and pursued doctoral studies at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology under the direction of Herman P. Meissner. A leading chemical engineer of the 20th century, Meissner (doctorate 1938) had been educated under Hans Joachim Schumacher (1904-1990, link) at the University of Frankfurt. Schumacher himself was a doctoral student of the legendary Max Bodenstein (1871-1942, link. An article found here (link) presents the rich history of the connections of the Merrill/Meissner/Schumacher academic tree to the early French and German chemists of the 18th and 19th century.<br>
Merrill received his PhD in 1947 working on theories of adhesion of two polymers (thesis on "Certain Cohesive and Adhesive Characteristics of Thermoplastic High Polymers".[3] His work anticipated much later work of Pierre-Gilles de Gennes and others on polymer interdigitation to improve adhesion. Upon graduation he was employed by Dewey and Almy (http://www.grace.com/about/history.aspx?timeframe=1900, later part of W.R. Grace) and joined MIT as an Assistant Professor of Chemical Engineering in 1950. He went through the ranks and was appointed Carbon P Dubbs Distinguished Professor of Chemical Engineering in 1973, a position he held until 1998. Since then, he has been Professor Emeritus of Chemical Engineering. He served also as Chief Scientist and Consultant in Biochemical Engineering to Harvard University Health Services, 1984-98. He was a Visiting Lecturer in Chemistry at Harvard University from 1952 to 1958, a consultant at the Peter Bent Brigham Hospital of Boston from 1960 to 1972, a consultant of the Children's Hospital in Boston from 1969 to 1972, and consultant of the Beth Israel Hospital in Boston from 1969 to 1985.<br>
Research<br>
Over a 66-year career Professor Edward Merrill has been a pioneer in several fields of bioengineering. In the 1950s and 60s he was the leading scientist in blood rheology. In the 1960s and 1970s Merrill was a pioneer in the development of the artificial kidney, analysis of its transport characteristics and optimization of hemodialyzer membranes. In the 1960s-80s he pioneered protein/polymer interaction under stagnant and flow conditions and made exceptional contributions in the development of hydrogels as biomaterials, and in ionic or covalent heparinization techniques on polymer surfaces for antithrombogenic materials. Ed Merrill and Ed Saltzman of Harvard were the pioneers who proposed poly (ethylene oxide) as a highly biocompatible biomaterial in a seminal paper[4] and did significant studies to analyze its stricture and blood response. In the 1990s Ed Merrill and W Harris developed irradiation crosslinked high-density polyethylene (HDPE) that has become the main material for total joint replacement.<br>
Merrill's ideas on poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) as a non-thrombogenic biomaterial (1979 with Saltzman) led to an explosion in the use of PEG- and PEO- decorated biomedical systems. Merrill's work on highly crosslinked polyethylene (1990s with W Harris) led to the new HDPE materials used in artificial joints now (a $4 billion industry). Merrill's pioneering work on artificial kidneys (with Colton and Britton in the 1960s) led to the development of the first NIH guidelines for artificial kidneys in the 1960s<br>
