<h2>Notes</h2>
Theodore POMEROY
<p>
<a name ="I015723"><b>[I015723]</b></a><br />
Dr. Theodore Pomeroy, who came from Cooperstown, was born at Southampton, Mass., March 14, 1785, was graduated at Yale College in 1808, studied medicine with Dr. James, of Albany and afterward of Utica, and also with Dr. Chester, of Hudson, attended lectures at Pittsfield, and had made a successful stand in Cooperstown. <br>
His new venture in Utica was a fortunate one, for he soon fell into a large and profitable business, and for ten or a dozen years at least was the medical adviser of some of the best families of the place. His pleasant manner and his engaging exterior attracted admirers who were changed to friends when they realized the purity and uprightness of his life. He loved his profession as an art more than as a science. He cared less for brilliant exploits in surgery than to relieve the common ailments of humanity, and win the rewards of his exertion as well as the gratitude of those on whom he waited. <br>
Other pursuits akin to medicine into which he was drawn tended to lead him more and more from his chosen calling and eventually took him wholly out of it. With Thomas R. Walker he had become interested in an oilcloth factory from their having loaned money to J. D. Edwards, its founder, and which the latter was unable to reimburse them. They assumed the charge of the factory and for many years continued its management. After Mr. Walker withdrew, about the year 1854, Dr. Pomeroy kept on in the concern in company with his son Theodore. As a citizen, neighbor, and friend the rank of Dr. Pomeroy was among the liberal, the useful, and the trusted. <br>
He died at St. Anthony, June 26, 1860. His first wife and the mother of three of his children was Mary, daughter of Dr. Thomas Fuller, of Cooperstown. His second was Miss Cornelia Voorhees, of New Brunswick, N. J.<br>

MRS. WM. W. (MARGARET POORMAN) SEARS<br>
Word was received hereon Monday announcing the death of Mrs. William W. Sears, which occurred at Webster, S. Dak. , on Sunday. While her health had been very poor for many years, it was not known to her friends here that her condition was critical. In fact, she had been in her usual health until two days previous to her death, having been about town on Friday. Margaret Poorman was born In New York, Dec. 8, 1832. She was united in marriage with William W. Sears on September 27,1855, and they came to Illinois in 1867 and located at El Paso, Woodford county. They resided in Woodford and McLean counties until 1865 when they moved to Chatsworth. They made this city their home from that time until last spring, when they moved to Webster, S. Dak., with the hope that the change or climate would be beneficial to Mrs. Sears' failing health, but her physical forces could not be rejuvenated, and her death occurred as above stated. Mr. And Mrs. Sears were the parents of ten children, three of whom survive, namely Judge Frank Sears, of Webster, S. Dak.; Grace, wife of Jay Baker, of Kansas City, Mo.; and Miss Frances who is unmarried and has made her home with her parents.
