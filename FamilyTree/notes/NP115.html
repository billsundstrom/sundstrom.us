Jonathan Myrick DANIELS
<p>
<a name ="I083496"><b>[I083496]</b></a><br />
Social Reformer. A 1961 alumnus of the Virginia Military Institute (where he graduated as Valedictorian of his class), he entered Harvard University later that to study English Literature. However, he left Harvard when he was accepted into the Episcopal Theological School in Cambridge, Massachusetts, and in 1963 he began his studies to graduate in 1966. In early 1965, Martin Luther King was asking that students and clergy come to Selma, Alabama to participate in a march to the state capital in Montgomery. Daniels and several other seminary students left for Alabama when they heard King's call. He and a friend of his after seeing how bad things where, decided to spend the next semester and following summer in Alabama, helping out any way they could. They tutored children, helped poor locals apply for government aid, and worked to register voters. During this time Daniels and his friend lived with Black families. On August 13, 1965, Daniels decided to go with a group of people to picket whites-only stores in the small town of Fort Deposit, Alabama. The next day, Daniels and the protestors were arrested and taken to jail in the nearby town of Hayneville, where they were held for six days because they refused to pay bail. Then on August 20, they were released for no apparent reason or any means of transport back to Fort Deposit. Daniels and a few others went down the street to a store that would serve nonwhites to get a cold soft drink. They were met at the door by Tom Coleman, an unemployed highway construction worker, who was holding a shotgun. Coleman threatened the group and then aimed the gun at 16 year old Ruby Sales, Daniels instantly pushed Sales out of the way and was hit with a full load of buck shot in the right chest, killing him instantly. Coleman was acquitted by a jury of twelve white men, on the grounds of "self-defense". Today Daniels is honored by being one of 15 Modern Day Martyrs of the Episcopal Church. V.M.I.'s Jonathan Daniels Humantarian Award is named in honor of him as well as the Daniels Archway at V.M.I.. Author Charles Eagles published a work about him called "Outside Agitator: Jon Daniels and the Civil Rights Movement in Alabama" in 2000.<br>
--------------------------------------------------<br>
Seminarian Jonathan Myrick Daniels, 26 years old, unmarried, was on a civil rights mission when he was martyred with a shotgun blast at close range by Deputy Sheriff Thomas Coleman on the porch of Varner's Cash Store in Hayneville, Lowndes County, Alabama. It is said that Jon Daniels died without fear for he knew the dangers of doing civil rights work in the south. He wrote after arriving in Alabama, "I lost fear in the black belt when I began to know in my bones and sinews that...in the only sense that really matters I am already dead and my life is hid with Christ in God." An all-white jury later acquitted Coleman. A monument to Jonathan Daniels was erected in Hayneville in August 1997.<br>
When he heard of the tragedy, Martin Luther King, Jr. said, "One of the most heroic Christian deeds of which I have heard in my entire ministry was performed by Jonathan Daniels. Certainly there are no incidents more beautiful in the annals of church history, and though we are grieved at this time, our grief should give way to a sense of Christian honor and nobility."<br>
Over the years, Jonathan Daniels' selfless act has been often recognized. In the summer of 1994, the General Convention of the Episcopal Church officially recognized Jonathan as a martyr, and gave him his own liturgical day [on the date of his arrest] in the Church Calendar, an honor bordering on sainthood. Daniels is also recognized by the Episcopal Church as one of 15 modern-day martyrs, honored in the Chapel of Martyrs in England's Canterbury Cathedral. Jonathan Myrick Daniels and Martin Luther King, Jr. are the only two representatives from the United States. He is also one of 40 slain heroes of the civil rights movement whose names are inscribed on the Civil Rights Memorial in Montgomery, Alabama (maintained by the Southern Poverty Law Center). <br>
He had been valedictorian of his class at the Virginia Military Institute, which annually honors him by bestowing the Jonathan Myrick Daniels '61 Humanitarian Award. President Jimmy Carter was the initial recipient. <br>

She ethnographically traces how people living with HIV and their healthcare providers are navigating biomedical bureaucracies, grappling with new insurance markets and attempting to control healthcare costs. Adele Clarke, Janet Shim, Howard Pinderhughes and Jenny Reardon serve on her dissertation committee. She will be in residence at the Brocher Foundation in Geneva, Switzerland in Winter 2017 to extend her research into a book project.<br>
