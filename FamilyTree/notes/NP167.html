Bjorn ERIKSSON
<p>
<a name ="I007799"><b>[I007799]</b></a><br />
Björn was the father of Olof (II) Björnsson and Eric the Victorious, according to Hervarar saga. He was the grand-father of Styrbjörn Starke. According to Hervarar Saga he was the son of an Erik who fought Harald Fairhair who succeeded the brothers Björn at Hauge and Anund Uppsale. Erik Anundsson is the only Erik who fits.<br>
<br>
In the saga of Olaf the Holy, Snorri Sturluson quotes Thorgny Lawspeaker on king Björn:<br>
<br>
    My father, again, was a long time with King Bjorn, and was well acquainted with his ways and manners. In Bjorn's lifetime his kingdom stood in great power, and no kind of want was felt, and he was gay and sociable with his friends.<br>
<br>
When Björn died Olof and Eric were elected to be co-rulers of Sweden. Eric would however disinherit his nephew Styrbjörn.<br>
<br>
Adam of Bremen, however, only gives Emund Eriksson as the predecessor of Eric the Victorious. Since the Swedes seem to have had a system of co-rulership (Diarchy), it is probable that Emund Eriksson was a co-ruler of Björn's.<br>
