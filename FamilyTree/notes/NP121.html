<h2>Notes</h2>
Guillaume IV DE AQUITAINE
<p>
<a name ="I007471"><b>[I007471]</b></a><br />
William IV of Aquitaine (937 - February 5, 995), nicknamed Fierebras (Iron Arm), was Duke of Aquitaine and Count of Poitiers between 963 and 995.<br>
<br>
William was the son of William III of Aquitaine and Gerloc (Adele) of Normandy. He was brother in law of Hugh I of France, married to his sister Adelaide. William married Emma of Blois. Their marriage was stormy, in part because of William's indulgence in the pursuit of women and wild animals. She banished his paramours, they separated twice for long periods, and finally he retired to a monastery, leaving Emma to rule Aquitaine in the name of their son until 1004.<br>
</p>
Guillaume IX DE AQUITAINE
<p>
<a name ="I007671"><b>[I007671]</b></a><br />
William IX of Aquitaine (October 22, 1071 - February 10, 1126, also Guillaume or Guilhem d'Aquitaine), nicknamed the Troubador was Duke of Aquitaine and Gascony and Count of Poitiers as William VII of Poitiers between 1086 and 1126. He was also one of the leaders of the crusade of 1101 and one of the first vernacular poets and troubadours.<br>
<br>
Life and Family<br>
William was the son of William VIII of Aquitaine by his third wife Hildegarde of Burgundy. His birth was an event of great celebration, but at first he was considered illegitimate by religious authorities because of his father's earlier divorces and his parents consanguinity. This obliged his father to make a pilgrimage to Rome soon after his birth, where he sought and received papal approval of his marriage and children.<br>
<br>
In 1094 he married Philippa of Toulouse, the daughter and heiress of William IV of Toulouse. By Philippa, William had:<br>
    * William X of Aquitaine, his heir.<br>
    * Agnes of Aquitaine, who married (1) Aimery V of Thouars; (2) to King Ramiro II of Aragon<br>
    * Henry, abbot of Cluny<br>
    * Raymond of Poitiers, ruler of the principality of Antioch, a crusader state<br>
<br>
He was excommunicated twice, the first time in 1114 for some unknown offense. His response to this was to demand absolution from the Bishop of Poitiers at swordpoint. He was excommunicated the second time for carrying off Dangereuse, the wife of his vassal Aimery I de Rochefoucauld, Viscount of Châtellerault. He installed her in the Maubergeonne tower of his castle, and, as related by William of Malmesbury, even painted a picture of her on his shield.<br>
<br>
This greatly offended both his wife and his son, William. According to Orderic Vitalis, Philippa protested her treatment in October 1119 at the Council of Reims, claiming to have been abandoned by the duke in favor of Dangereuse. She later retired to the convent of Fontevrault. Relations were only patched up with his son when the younger William married Ænor of Châtellerault, Dangereuse's daughter by her husband.<br>
<br>
His 13th century Provençal biographer remembers him:<br>
    "[William IX] was one of the most courtly men in the world and one of the greatest deceivers of women. He was a fine knight at arms, liberal in his attentions to ladies, and a fine composer and singer of songs."<br>
<br>
Military life<br>
William invited Pope Urban II to spend Christmas 1095 at his court. The pope urged him to take the cross and leave for the Holy Land, but William was more interested in exploiting the absence of Raymond IV of Toulouse, his wife's uncle, to press a claim to Toulouse. He and Philippa did capture Toulouse in 1098, an act for which they were threatened with excommunication. Partly out of a desire to regain favor with the religious authorities and partly out of a wish to see the world, William joined the First Crusade in 1099.<br>
<br>
He arrived in the Holy land in 1101 and stayed there until the following year. His record as a general is not very impressive. William fought mostly skirmishes in Anatolia and was frequently defeated. His recklessness had his army ambushed on several occasions, with great losses to his own side. In September 1101 his entire army was destroyed by the Turks at Heraclea; William himself barely escaped with a few survivors.<br>
<br>
Later on in his life, William joined forces with the kingdoms of Castile (an old ally) and Léon. Between 1120 and 1123, Aquitanian troops fought side by side with queen Urraca of Castile, in an effort to conquer the Moors of Cordoba and complete the Reconquista. During his sojourn in Spain, William was given a rock crystal vase by a Muslim ally that he later beqeathed to his granddaughter Eleanor. The vase probably originated in Sassanid Persia in the 7th century.<br>
<br>
William IX also provided troops to Philip I of France in his war against William the Conqueror.<br>
<br>
Poetry<br>
William's greatest legacy to history was not as a warrior but as a man of the arts. He was one of the first European lyric poets and used vernacular language in his songs and poems. Eleven of his songs are the earliest troubadour poems that have survived into the 21st century (Merwin, 2002). His artistic name was lo cons de Peitieus, and he was one of the most important troubadours of the Middle Age's Provençal literature. The topics of these were very diverse, but the majority is about sex, love and women and often about his own sexual prowesses. This choice of subject in a world used to music only for the praise of God and heroes caused scandal and admiration at the same time. In the next few centuries, troubadours and vernacular poetry would be fashionable and the most important artistic movement of the Middle Ages.<br>
<br>
William was a man that loved scandal and no doubt enjoyed shocking his audiences. In the return from the crusade, he abandoned his wife in favour of a married woman, known as Dangereuse from his poems, and faced the risk of excommunication for the deed. He also composed a song about constructing a convent in his lands, where the nuns would be picked among the most beautiful women in the region. The fake nunnery project was abandoned and William ended by giving enormous donations to the church, perhaps to regain the pope's favour. He also constructed the palace of Poitou.<br>
<br>
One of William's poems is a musing on mortality; it begins: Since now I have a mind to sing/I'll make a song of that which saddens me, and goes on to say: For I have known delight and dalliance/Both far and near, yea and in my own dwelling/But this day, joy and dalliance, farewell. He died in 1126.<br>

<br>
William was the son of William IV of Aquitaine by his wife Emma of Blois. He seems to have taken after his formidable mother, who ruled Aquitaine until 1004. He was a friend to Fulbert of Chartres and founded a cathedral school at Poitiers. He himself was very well educated, a collector of books, and turned the prosperous court of Aquitaine into the learning center of Southern France.<br>

Guillaume X DE AQUITAINE
<p>
<a name ="I007458"><b>[I007458]</b></a><br />
From Wikipedia<br>
<br>
William X of Aquitaine (1099 - April 9, 1137), nicknamed the Saint was Duke of Aquitaine and Gascony and Count of Poitiers as William VIII of Poitiers between 1126 and 1137. He was the son of William, the Troubador by his wife, Philippa of Toulouse.<br>
<br>
William was born in Toulouse during the brief period when his parents ruled the capitol. Later that same year, much to his wife's ire, Duke William mortgaged Toulouse to Philippa's cousin, Bertrand of Toulouse, and then left on Crusade. Philippa and her infant son were left in Poitiers. When Duke William returned, he took up with Dangereuse, the wife of one of his vassals, and set aside his rightful wife, Philippa. This caused conflict between father and son, until William married Ænor of Châtellerault, daughter of his father's mistress, in 1121. He had from her three children: William Aigret, who died young; the heiress Eleanor of Aquitaine; and Petronilla of Aquitaine, who married Raoul I of Vermandois. Both Ænor and William Aigret died in 1130.<br>
<br>
As his father before him, William X was a patron of troubadors, music and literature. He was an educated man and strived to give his two daughters an excellent education, in a time when Europe's rulers were hardly literate. When Eleanor succeeded him as Duchess, she continued William's tradition and transformed the Aquitanian court into Europe's centre of knowledge.<br>
<br>
Despite his love of the arts, William was not a peaceful man, and was frequently involved in conflicts with neighbouring Normandy (which he raided in 1136) and France. Even inside his borders, William faced an alliance of the Lusignans and the Parthenays against him, an issue resolved with total destruction of the enemies. In international politics, William X initially supported antipope Anacletus II in the schism of 1130, opposite to Pope Innocent II, against the will of his own bishops. In 1134 Saint Bernard of Clairvaux convinced William to drop his support to Anacletus and join Innocent.<br>
<br>
In 1137 William joined the pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela, but died of food poisoning during the trip. On his deathbed, he expressed his wish to see king Louis VII of France as protector of his fifteen year old daughter Eleanor. Louis VII accepted this wish and married the heiress of Aquitaine.<br>

Hunuld DE AQUITAINE
<p>
<a name ="I010220"><b>[I010220]</b></a><br />
From Wikipedia<br>
<br>
Hunald (a.k.a. Hunold, or Hunaud), Duke of Aquitaine, succeeded his father Odo of Aquitaine (a.k.a. Eudes the Great) in 735.<br>
<br>
He refused to recognize the high authority of the Frankish mayor of the palace, Charles Martel, whereupon Charles marched south of the Loire, seized Bordeaux and Blaye, but eventually allowed Hunald to retain Aquitaine on condition that he should promise fidelity.<br>
<br>
From 736 to 741 the relations between Charles and Hunald seem to have remained amicable. But at Charles's death in 741 Hunald declared war against the Franks, crossed the Loire and burned Chartres. Menaced by Pippin and Carloman, Hunald begged for peace in 745 and retired to a monastery, probably on the Île de Ré.<br>
<br>
We find him later in Italy, where he allied himself with the Lombards and was stoned to death. He had left the duchy of Aquitaine to Waifer of Aquitaine, who was probably his son, and who struggled for eight years in defending his independence against King Pippin.<br>
<br>
At the death of Pippin and at the beginning of the reign of Charlemagne, there was a last rising of the Aquitanians. This revolt was directed by a certain Hunald, and was repressed in 768 by Charlemagne and his brother Carloman.<br>
<br>
Hunald sought refuge with the duke of the Gascons, Lupus, who handed him over to his enemies. In spite of the opinion of certain historians, this Hunald seems to have been a different person from the old duke of Aquitaine.<br>

Ida DE AQUITAINE
<p>
<a name ="I004789"><b>[I004789]</b></a><br />
Ancestral Roots (line 190-9) states that Itta is supposed daughter of Arnoldus Bishop of Metz. Obviously there is no convincing evidence, one way or the other, just hints & estimations. I had previously determined that Dode was possibly/probably daughter of Arnoldus, which (if Itta were her sister) would make Saint Begga and her husband Ansgise/Ansgisel 1st cousins. While marriages between 1st cousins were not uncommon during this era, these people were supposedly close to the church and may not have countenanced such a marriage.<br>
<br>
Thus I have decided to adopt the following ancestry for Itta, given below in a post to SGM, 18 Feb 2003, by David Hughes (nothing is sure):<br>

<br>
I am curious about the sudden interest in Attila The Hun & the genealogy of his house. . . for what it is worth here are my notes on the subject for consideration:<br>
<br>

a. Basiq, King of Huns [2], d c 370<br>
b. Balamber, King of Huns [3], attacks Byzantine empire, d 390<br>
c. Uldin (Uldes), King of Huns [4] 390-411<br>

The two sons of Prince Mundzuk (above) were<br>
a. Bleda, King of Huns [8] 433-437<br>
b. ATTILA<br>
-------------------------------<br>
<br>
x. ATTILA "THE HUN" & "The Scourge", King of Huns [9] 437-453 had several wives: =1 Arykan; =2 Helche (Kreka); =3 Kriemhilt; =4 Ildiko (Hildiko); =5 Gundrun [note: a German myth says that his Burgundian wife, Gundrun, murdered her twin sons, Erpe & Eiti, begotten by him, and served their hearts for Attila to eat]<br>
<br>
Issue:<br>
a. Scharpfe, murdered 453<br>
b. Ortelipe, murdered 453<br>
[Note: the sons of ATTILA quarreled after his death over the chieftainship, during which, Ardaric, the Gepidae king, rallied the Germans against their Hunnish masters and utterly defeated the Huns at the Battle of Nedao, 456, after which the remnant of the Huns gathered around the sons & grandsons of Attila "the Hun", creating several groups, of which some remained in Germany and Central Europe while others retreated to Scythia-Minor and became the Magyars, Bulgars, & Mongols]<br>

m. Escam (Ascama) (daughter), wife of Ardaric, a Gepidae chief/king<br>
-----------------<br>
<br>
Note: the descent-line from Attila The Hun to Charlemagne posted recently on the net is incorrect, however, the descent can be made through the wife of Pepin of Landen rather than through his mother, which then would be:<br>
<br>
00. Attila The Hun (d453)<br>
01. Escam (Ascama) = Ardaric, Gepidae-King of Germany (d476)<br>
02. Elemund (d493/515)<br>
03. Austrisa = Waccho, Lombard-King of Italy (d540)<br>

05. Grimoalde, Duke of Aquitaine (d599) = Itite (d612), daughter of Severus, a duke<br>

10. Pepin "Le Korte", King of France 751-768 = Bertha "The White-Lady"<br>
11. Charlemagne<br>

Alfonso II DE ARAGON
<p>
<a name ="I007515"><b>[I007515]</b></a><br />
From Wikipedia<br>
<br>
Alfonso II of Aragon (Alfons I of Provence and Barcelona, 1152-1196), known as the Chaste or the Troubadour was king of Aragon and count of Barcelona from 1162 to 1196. He was the son of Ramon Berenguer IV of Barcelona and Petronila of Aragon.<br>
<br>
Born Ramon Berenguer, he ascended the united thrones of Aragon (1164) and Barcelona (1162) as Alfonso, changing his name in compliment to the Aragonese, to honor King Alfonso I of Aragon. He was the first ruler to be both king of Aragon and count of Barcelona. He was also Count of Provence from 1181 to 1185.<br>
<br>
For most of his reign he was allied with King Alfonso VIII of Castile, both against Navarre and against the Moorish taifa kingdoms of the south. In his Reconquista effort Alfonso pushed as far as Teruel, conquering this important stronghold on the road to Valencia in 1171. The same year saw him capturing Caspe.<br>
<br>
Apart from common interests, kings of Aragon and Castile were united by a formal bond of vassalage the former owed to the latter. Besides, on January 18, 1174 in Saragossa Alfonso married infanta Sancha of Castile, sister of the Castilean king.<br>
<br>
Another milestone in this alliance was a formal treaty the two kings concluded at Cazorla in 1179, delineating zones of conquest in the south along the watershed of rivers Júcar and Segura. Southern areas of Valencia including Denia were thus secured to Aragon.<br>
<br>
During his reign Catalonian influence north of the Pyrenees reached its zenith. His realms incorporated not only Provence, but also the counties of Cerdagne and Roussillon (inherited in 1172). Béarn and Bigorre paid hommage to him in 1187. Alfonso's involvement in the affairs of Languedoc, which will cost the life of his successor, Peter II of Aragon, for the moment proved highly beneficial, strengthening Catalonian trade and stimulating emigration from the north to colonise the newly reconquered lands in Aragon.<br>
<br>
King Alfonso died in 1196. He was a noted poet of his time and a close friend of King Richard the Lionheart.<br>
<br>

Andregoto Galı́ndez DE ARAGON
<p>
<a name ="I015159"><b>[I015159]</b></a><br />
Andregoto Galı́ndez was daughter of Count Galindo II Aznárez Count of Aragon from 922, being by his second wife, Sancha Garcés of Pamplona. She is frequently referred to as Countess, and made heiress to her father, yet she was not the eldest daughter of her father, and likewise Aragon had already been absorbed into the Kingdom of Pamplona by Sancho I of Pamplona, years before her marriage to that king's son, Garcı́a Sánchez I. Garcı́a, who was her first cousin, divorced Andregoto due to consanguinity, leaving a sole son by her, Sancho II of Pamplona. It has been suggested that Andregoto remarried and had further children, although the details have not been discovered. Endregota, wife of 11th century count Sancho Maceratiz, calls herself a descendant of Andregoto Galı́ndez, but Ubieto Arteta suggests the later countess descended from her sister Velasquita Galı́ndez.<br>
</p>
Aznar I Galı́ndez DE ARAGON
<p>
<a name ="I010233"><b>[I010233]</b></a><br />
From Wikipedia<br>
<br>
Aznar I Galı́ndez (?? - 839) was Count of Aragón from 809 to 820, succeeding Aureolo upon the latter's death. From his loss of Aragón in 820 until his death in 839, Aznar I was count of Cerdagne and Urgel.<br>
<br>
Aznar I was the great-grandson of Galindo, probably head of the family that led the Frankish party in the region (as the son of Galindo, the count Velasco, in Pamplona, but this was opposed by the Basque party led by the Iñı́guez family), grandson of Galindo Aznárez and son of Aznar Galı́ndez. Aznar I governed under Frankish influence. Some sources mention him as count of Jaca. It is suposed that in 820 the allaince with the Franks was reversed, in favour of an alliance to Pamplona and the Banu Qasi of the Ebro Valley, and that he thus lost the county of Aragón and was compensated with Urgel and Cerdagne.<br>
<br>
He married to Eneca Garcés (modern hypotheses believe a lady from Gascony) and they had four children: Matrona, married Garcı́a Galı́ndez, king of Pamplona who deposed Aznar I and ruled Aragón 820-833; Eilo; Centulf; and Galindo I Aznárez, count of Aragón 844-867.<br>

Galindo I Aznárez DE ARAGON
<p>
<a name ="I015527"><b>[I015527]</b></a><br />
Galindo I Aznárez (?? - 867) was Count of Aragón from 844 to 867, succeeding Galindo Garcés. Aznárez was the son of Aznar I Galı́ndez, who had been Count of Aragón from 809 to 820 and Count of Urgell, Cerdagne, and Conflent (820-??). Galindo I Aznárez received these last three counties from his father sometime before 833, in 833 was designated count of Pallars and Ribagorza, but only governed them for a year. After a period of rule in Pamplona, he came back to Aragón in 844 to assume the Countship upon the heirless death of Galindo Garcés.<br>
<br>
Galindo I Aznárez was married to Guldreguda, and had one son, Aznar II Galı́ndez, his successor.<br>

Petronila DE ARAGON
<p>
<a name ="I007660"><b>[I007660]</b></a><br />
Petronila of Aragon<br>
From Wikipedia<br>
<br>
Petronila of Aragon (1135- October 17, 1174, Barcelona) was the daughter of King Ramiro II of Aragon and Agnes of Poitiers, a.k.a. Agnes of Aquitaine. (Petronila is also referred to by various sources as "Petronilla", "Petronilla Ramı́rez", "Pétronille", or "Petronella").<br>
<br>
In 1134, when his brother Alfonso I of Aragon died heirless, Ramiro was bishop of Barbastro-Roda. He was given papal dispensation to abdicate his monastic vows in order to secure the succession to the throne. King Ramiro the Monk, as he is known, married Agnes of Poitiers, produced an heiress, Petronila, bethrothed her (aged two) to Ramon Berenguer IV of Catalonia, abdicated in her favour and returned to monastic life.<br>
<br>
The Aragonese monarchy had previously passed only to males, thus Petronila's succession was an exception at the time. Bastardy was not an impediment of succession in Aragon, the ancestor of this line, Ramiro I of Aragon having been a bastard. The heir in male line, Garcia VI of Navarre, was genealogically relatively distant, son of Ramiro II's second cousin. Petronila's succession created a new case in succession custom in Aragon.<br>
<br>
Petronila married Ramon Berenguer in 1150. While he was alive, they nominally ruled their possessions separately, although the count had the final say over both Aragon and Catalonia. Upon his death Petronila renounced the crown of Aragon in favour of her eldest son Ramon, who, in compliment to the Aragonese, changed his name to Alfonso. Alfonso II of Aragon, I of Barcelona was the first ruler of both Aragon and Catalonia. This effected the dynastic union between the two countries that was to last until their incorporation in the kingdom of Spain in 1707.<br>

Ramiro DE ARAGON
<p>
<a name ="I007461"><b>[I007461]</b></a><br />
Ramiro I of Aragon (died 1063), king of Aragon 1035-1063, was the first king of Aragon proper.<br>
<br>
He was the natural son of Sancho III of Navarre.<br>
<br>
In 1035 he inherited the small valley of the River Aragón (the northwest corner of the modern province of Huesca) with the title of 'king'. After the death of his brother Gonzalo in 1045, he obtained as well the kingdoms of Sobrarbe (the central north strip of the modern province of Huesca) and Ribagorza (the northeast corner of that province).<br>
<br>
He died at the siege of Graus.<br>

Ramiro II of Aragon 'the Monk' (ca. 1075 - August 16, 1154, at Huesca) was a king of Aragon (1134-1137).<br>
<br>
In 1134, when his brother Alfonso I of Aragon 'the Battler' died heirless, Ramiro was bishop of Barbastro-Roda. He temporarily gave up his monastic vows in order to secure the succession to the crown. Although Ramiro had to put up with the loss of Navarre, which had formed part of his late brother's dominions but in 1134 became independent under Garcı́a Ramı́rez, he fought off two other claimants to the throne, one Pedro de Atarés, an illegitimate connection of the royal line, and Alfonso VII of Castile.<br>
<br>
The reign of Ramiro the Monk, as he is known, only lasted three years - just enough for him to put down his nobles' rebellion, marry Agnes of Poitiers, daughter of William IX of Aquitaine, produce a heiress, Petronila, betrothe her (aged two) to Ramon Berenguer IV of Catalonia, abdicate in her favour and return to monastic life.<br>

Sacho I DE ARAGON
<p>
<a name ="I007669"><b>[I007669]</b></a><br />
Sancho of Aragon (c. 1042 - June 4, 1094, Huesca) was king of Aragon (1063-1094) and of Navarre (1076-1094) as Sancho V of Navarre. He was also called Sancho Ramirez.<br>
<br>
He was the son of Ramiro I of Aragon and Ermesinde of Bigorre, and he succeeded his father Ramiro in 1063. He was elected king of Navarre in 1076 after Sancho IV of Navarre was murdered by his own brother or brothers, and the succession there went into crisis. Sancho's young son Garcia was recognized as titular king in Leon and Castile, where he lived in exile.<br>
<br>
Sancho conquered Barbastro in 1065, Graus in 1083, and Monzon in 1089.<br>
<br>
He married firstly c. 1065 (divorced 1071) Isabel of Urgel (d. c. 1071), daughter of Count Armengol III, and secondly 1076 Felicie de Roucy (d May 3, 1123), daughter of Count Hilduin III of Roucy.<br>
<br>
His three sons, Pedro, Alfonso and Ramiro, succeeded in turn to the throne of Aragon.<br>

Constatance DE ARLES

From Wikipedia<br>
<br>
Constance of Arles (973 - July 25, 1034) was the third wife and queen of King Robert II of France. She was the daughter of Count Guilhem II of Provence and Adelais of Anjou, and the sister of Count Guilhem III of Provence.<br>
<br>
In 1003 she was married to King Robert, after his divorce from his second wife. The marriage was stormy; the family of Robert's second queen, Bertha, opposed her, and Constance was despised for importing her Provençal kinfolk. Robert's friend, Hugh of Beauvais, tried to convince the king to repudiate her in 1007. Constance's response was to have Beauvais murdered by the knights of her kinsman, Fulk Nerra. In 1010 Robert even went to Rome, accompanied by his former wife Bertha, to seek permission to divorce Constance and remarry Bertha. Constance encouraged her sons to revolt against their father, and then favored her younger son, Robert, over her elder son, Henri.<br>
<br>
During the famous trial of Herefast de Crepon (who was alleged to be involved with the Cathars) in 1022, the crowd outside the church in Orleans became so unruly that, according to Moore:<br>
<br>
    "At the king's command, Queen Constance stood before the doors of the Church, to prevent the common people from killing them inside the Church, and they were expelled from the bosom of the Church. As they were being driven out, the queen struck out the eye of Stephen, who had once been her confessor, with the staff which she carried in her hand."<br>
<br>
The symbolism, or reality, of putting an eye out is used often in medieval accounts to show the ultimate sin of breaking of one's oath, whether it be heresy, or treason to ones lordship, or in this case both. Stephen's eye was put out by the hand of a Queen wielding a staff (royal scepters were usually tipped with a cross) thus symbolically providing justice for the treasoned lord on earth and in heaven.<br>
<br>
Constance and Robert had seven children:<br>
   1. Advisa, Countess of Auxerre, (c.1003-after 1063), married Count Renaud I of Nevers<br>
   2. Hugh Magnus, co-king (1007-September 17, 1025)<br>
   3. Henri (May 4, 1008-August 4, 1060)<br>
   4. Adela, Countess of Contenance (1009-June 5, 1063), married (1) Duke Richard III of Normandy (2) Count Baldwin V of Flanders<br>
   5. Robert I, Duke of Burgundy (1011-March 21, 1076)<br>
   6. Eudes (1013-1056)<br>
   7. Constance (1014-unknown), married Manasses de Dammartin<br>
<br>
At Constance's urging, her eldest son Hugh Magnus was crowned co-king alongside his father in 1017. Hugh Magnus demanded his parents share power with him, and rebelled against his father in 1025. He died suddenly later that year, an exile and a fugitive. Robert and Constance quarelled over which of their surviving sons should inherit the throne; Robert favored their second son Henri, while Constance favored their third son, Robert. Despite his mother's protests, Henry was crowned in 1027. Fulbert, Bishop of Chartres, wrote a letter claiming that he was "frightened away" from the consecration of Henry "by the savagery of his mother, who is quite trustworthy when she promises evil."<br>
<br>
Constance encouraged her sons to rebel, and Henri and Robert began attacking and pillaging the towns and castles belonging to their father. Robert attacked Burgundy, the duchy he had been promised but had never received, and Henry seized Dreux. At last King Robert agreed to their demands and peace was made which lasted until the king's death.<br>
<br>
King Robert died in 1031, and soon Constance was at odds with both her elder son, Henri, and her younger son Robert. Constance seized her dower lands and refused to surrender them. Henri fled to Normandy, where he received aid, weapons, and soldiers from his brother Robert. He returned to besiege his mother at Poissy, but Constance escaped to Pontoise. She only surrendered when Henri began the siege of Puiset and swore to slaughter all the inhabitants.<br>
<br>
Constance died in 1034, and was buried beside her husband Robert at Saint-Denis Basilica.<br>

Willa, known as Willa of Tuscany, was the daughter of Boso, Margrave of Tuscany and his wife Willa of Burgundy.[1] She was the wife and queen consort of Berengar II of Italy. She was the mother of Adalbert, Guy, Conrad and Rozala of Italy.<br>
She mistreated Adelaide of Italy when Berengar held her captive for several months in 951. The chronicler Liutprand of Cremona, raised at the court at Pavia, gives several particularly vivid accounts[2] of Willa's character in Antapodosis.[3] After Berengar's deposition, she was held captive in a German nunnery.<br>
