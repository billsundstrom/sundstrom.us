<p>
<a name ="I105276"><b>[I105276]</b></a><br />
Donald "Don" Lee Patterson, 87 of Twin Falls, Idaho passed away at his home on Feb. 11th, 2019 surrounded by his family. He was born Sept. 5th, 1931 to Joseph and Emrett Patterson. He had 4 brothers and 4 sisters. Don joined the Airforce in 1952. He was a first class airman. He married Mary Ann Griffin on June 16th, 1958 and they had 3 children.

He was preceded in death by his mother, father, 3 brothers, 2 sisters and 1 great granddaughter. Don is also survived by his 10 grandchildren and numerous great grandchildren, nieces and nephews. Before his passing you could see his glow and excitement when any of them came to visit. He was loved by everyone that knew him. His saying "I'm a lover not a fighter" really resonated to those around him. When he returned from the airforce he worked for the City of Twin Falls as a mechanic. He was willing to lend a hand to anybody that needed it. Don loved to spend time with his family, if he wasn't teaching them how to change their own oil, he was teaching them how to hunt and fish. At family gatherings you could always find him drinking a cold one and playing a game of horse shoes. He loved to play pinnacle. Don was truly a great role model to others. His great legacy will live on through stories told by future generations. A celebration of his life will be held at The Moose Lodge, 835 Falls Ave. Twin Falls on Saturday Feb. 23rd, 2019 at 2pm.<br>

Chris PAULSEN
<p>
<a name ="I046876"><b>[I046876]</b></a><br />
A Resident Here For 46 Years Passes Away--<br>
Christoffer Paulsen was born in Vilslev, Denmark, on September 24, 1857 and died October 23, 1924, living 67 years and 1 month.<br>
He landed in America in the fall of 1878 and located in Howard County, Nebraska, where he has lived ever since. On January 19, 1881 he was united in marriage to Miss Hanna Isaacson and to their union were born six children: Paul and Rose, who died at the age of 12 years, Glenn Paulsen, living near Dannebrog, Ray Paulsen at Lake Andes, So. Dakota, Mrs. Max Wilcox, San Francisco, California and Mrs. V. E. Evans of Grand Island.<br>
Mr. Paulsen's illness, became afflicted with stomach trouble about 25 years ago and withstood his illness bravely until 2 months ago, when he was confined to his bed. Everything that his loved ones could do for him was done until his demise. He leaves to mourn his death his wife and the above named children and also 3 sisters and 1 brother: Mrs. Mary Laverentz, Cheyenne, Wyoming, Mrs. Hans Petersen, Boelus, Mrs. Pauline Jones, Los Angeles, California, Peter Paulsen, Grand Island, and many other relatives and a host of friends. Mr. Paulsen was a good husband and father, a kind neighbor, honest and upright in all his dealings with men. He was a patient sufferer and always of a cheerful disposition. His old friend Rev. J. Chr. Pedersen, conducted the funeral service which was held from the home in St. Paul, Saturday afternoon, where a very large number of friends were gathered to pay their last respect to Mr. Paulsen. The body was taken to Dannebrog, where a short service was held at the grave. He was laid to rest in the beautiful Oak Ridge cemetery at Dannebrog. May the Lord bless and comfort our sorrowing friends.<br>
The Phonograph desires to add a few words to the above obituary which was prepared by our friend, Rev. Pedersen, a life-long friend of the deceased and a man who has been close to him during the 46 years he was a resident of our fair county. Mr. Paulsen was a very fine gentleman, an honor to the country he selected for his permanent home, a credit to the community that he selected to rear a family and bring them all up God-fearing, God-loving and self-respecting men and women. Our heart goes out to them in their hour of grief and sorrow, especially to Mrs. Paulsen who is thus bereft of her companion of more than 43 years time. Truly may it be said that a good man has been called to his reward.<br>
