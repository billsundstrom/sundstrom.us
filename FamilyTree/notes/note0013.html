Hugh, The Great (d. 956), was duke of the Franks and count of Paris, son of King Robert I of France and nephew of King Odo. His eldest son was Hugh Capet who became King of France in 987.<br />
 <br />
Hugh's first wife was Eadhild, a sister of the English king, Athelstan. At the death of Rudolph, duke of Burgundy, in 936, Hugh was in possession of nearly all the region between the Loire and the Seine, corresponding to the ancient Neustria, with the exception of the territory ceded to the Normans in 911. He took a very active part in bringing Louis IV (d'Outremer) from England in 936, but in the same year Hugh married Hedwige, (who was daughter of King Henry I of Germany and sister of the emperor Otto the Great) and soon quarrelled with Louis.<br />
 <br />
Hugh even paid homage to Otto, and supported him in his struggle against Louis. When Louis fell into the hands of the Normans in 945, he was handed over to Hugh, who released him in 946 only on condition that he should surrender the fortress of Laon. At the council of Ingelheim (948) Hugh was condemned, under pain of excommunication, to make reparation to Louis. It was not, however, until 950 that the powerful vassal became reconciled with his suzerain and restored Laon. But new difficulties arose, and peace was not finally concluded until 953.<br />
 <br />
On the death of Louis IV, Hugh was one of the first to recognize Lothair as his successor, and, at the intervention of Queen Gerberga, was instrumental in having him crowned. In recognition of this service Hugh was invested by the new king with the duchies of Burgundy (his suzerainty over which had already been nominally recognized by Louis IV) and Aquitaine. But his expedition in 955 to take possession of Aquitaine was unsuccessful. In the same year, however, Giselbert, duke of Burgundy, acknowledged himself his vassal and betrothed his daughter to Hugh's son Otto. At Giselbert's death (April 8, 956) Hugh became effective master of the duchy, but died soon afterwards, on the 16th or 17th of June 956.<br />

Thomas of Brotherton, 1st Earl of Norfolk (June 1, 1300-1338) was the sonof Edward I of England and Marguerite of France. He was named in honor ofSt. Thomas.<br />
 <br />
His father died when he was 7 years old. Thomas' half-brother, Edward, now became king of England. The Earldom of Cornwall had been intended for Thomas, but Edward instead bestowed it upon his favorite, Piers Gaveston, in 1306. When he was 10 years old, his brother Edward II of England assigned him and another brother, Edmund, the estates of Roger Bigod, 5th Earl of Norfolk who had died without heir in 1306.<br />
 <br />
In 1312 he was titled, "Earl of Norfolk" and on February 10, 1316 he was created Marshal of England. When his brother went to Scotland in the war, he was left Keeper of England. Thomas was known for having a hot and violent temper. He was one of the many victims of the unchecked greed of Hugh the younger Despenser, who stole some of the young earl's lands. He allied himself with Queen Isabella and Roger Mortimer, 1st Earl of March when they invaded England in 1326, and stood as one of the judges in the trials against both Despensers.<br />
 <br />
He married first, probably in 1319, to Alice Hayles, daughter of Sir Roger Hayles and Alice Skogan. She was supposed to have been a great beauty. Her father was the coroner of Norfolk, a title that held a different meaning in the 14th century than it does today; his post demanded that he collect and protect revenues for the king. Thomas and Alice had three children:<br />
   1)  Edward of Norfolk (c. 1320 - 1334)<br />
   2)  Margaret, Duchess of Norfolk (c. 1320 - 1399)<br />
   3)  Alice of Norfolk (1324 - 1352)<br />
 <br />
Alice Hayles died in 1330, when a chantry was founded for her soul in Bosham, Sussex. Thomas was married before March 28 1335 to Mary Brewes, widow of Ralph de Cobham, Lord Cobham. He died in September 1338, and was buried in the Abbey of Bury St. Edmunds. Thomas was also a ancestor of 2 of the wives of Henry VIII of England, Anne Boleyn and Catherine Howard<br />

Adele or Adelaide of Aquitaine (or Adelaide of Poitiers) (c. 945 or952-1004) was the daughter of William III of Aquitaine and Adele ofNormandy.<br />
 <br />
Her father used her as security for a truce with Hugh Capet, whom she married in 970. In 987, after the death of Louis V, the last Carolingian king of France, Hugh was elected the new king with Adelaide as queen. They were proclaimed at Noyon and blessed at Reims. They were the founders of the Capetian dynasty of France.<br />

 <br />
Robert I (c. 865 - June 15, 923), king of France, or king of the Franks, was the younger son of Robert the Strong, count of Anjou, and the brother of Odo, or Eudes, who became king of the western Franks in 888.<br />
 <br />
Appointed by Odo ruler of several counties, including the county of Paris, and abbot in commendam of many abbeys, Robert also secured the office of duke of the Franks, a military dignity of high importance. He did not claim the crown of France when his brother died in 898; but recognizing the supremacy of the Carolingian king, Charles III, the Simple, he was confirmed in his offices and possessions, after which he continued to defend northern France from the attacks of the Normans.<br />
 <br />
The peace between the king and his powerful vassal was not seriously disturbed until about 921. The rule of Charles, and especially his partiality for a certain Hagano, had aroused some irritation; and, supported by many of the clergy and by some of the most powerful of the Frankish nobles, Robert took up arms, drove Charles into Lorraine, and was himself crowned king of the Franks at Reims on June 29, 922. Collecting an army, Charles marched against the usurper, and on June 15 923, in a stubborn and sanguinary battle near Soissons, Robert was killed, according to one tradition in single combat with his rival.<br />
 <br />
Robert left a son, Hugh the Great, duke of the Franks, and his grandson was Hugh Capet, king of France.<br />

Mary E. Knight - a divorced woman - possibly died 19 Jan 1970 in Toledo,Lucas, OH.<br />
Also it is possible that she either died or divorced Charles Knight before 1940. This is based on the 1940 census listing of his wife being Myrle E. Knight (age 38) born in Michigan.  Because Edythe is not living with Charles, then divorce is more likely.<br />

Born: on 13 Jun 823 in Frankfort-sur-le-Main, Germany, son of Louis I,King de France and Judith de Baviere , Some sources assert King CharlesII was born in the year 829.<br />
 <br />
Note - between 824 and 875 in France: The birth of Charles II in 823 did not at first excite jealousy or rivalry among his brothers. In 829, Charles was granted the region of Alemannia, Rhaetia and part of Burgundy. In 837, his Father Louis I "Le Debonnaire", by arrangement with Louis the German and Pepin gave Charles the land West of the Meuse, Burgundy, Chartres and Paris together with all the bishops, abbots and counts who held benefices in these territories. A portion of Neustria was added in 838, and upon Pepin's death, Louis Le Pieux made Charles King of Aquitaine. On 24 July 840, the new Emperor, Lothar, in Strasburg, refuses to support the land claims of Charles (from the agreement of Worms on 30 May 839). The two brothers, Louis and Charles, unite against Lothar and the War of the Three Brothers begins. Meanwhile, on 12 May 841, the Normands ravage Rouen and all the localities along the Seine, increasing their wealth considerably. At Fontenoy-en-Puisaye (24 June 841), Charles defeats his brothers Lothar (in spite of the arrival of the Army of Aquitaine in the Imperial ranks -- and at a total loss of 40,000 lives at the battle) and Louis Le Germanique. Charles and Louis signed an alliance on 14 February 842 at Strasbourg. Leaving Strasbourg, the two brothers defeat the imperial army of Lothar just West of Comblence. Lothar leaves Aix-le-Chapelle precipitously, pursued by the two brothers. In Mellecey, not far from Chalon-sur-Saone, Lothar proposes a plan to establish perpetual peace which is acceptable to both Louis and Charles. On 15 June, they sign the preliminary peace document. On 1 October 842, each of them sends 40 commissioners to Metz to forge the official document. Prudence, the Bishop of Troyes, notes that Louis regained Germania in the East, Lothar gets the middle part of the Franc Kingdom, including Italy, and Charles obtains the Western lands (West of the Rhone, including Soissons). After that Charles goes to the Palace in Quierzy, where he marries Ermentrude.<br />
 <br />
Charles signed the Treaty of Verdun (843) which split the Kingdom of Charlemagne. By the Treaty, the destiny of Occidental Europe would be heavily influenced to this day. Louis obtains all lands East of the Rhine, including the cities of Spire, Worms, Mayence. Lothar gets all the lands extending between the Rhine and the Escaut, the Cambresis, the Hainaut, the country of Mezieres, and all the countships neighboring the Meuse, through the Saone and the Rhone, the Artois and Italy. Charles got all the lands East all the way to Spain. The Kingdom of Charlemagne thus was split forever, with the most serious rift between the germanic lands of Louis, and the French lands of Charles. The intervening lands extending from Frisia to Rome, from the North Sea to the Mediterranean including what would become Holland, Belgium, Lorraine and Switzerland would become a sore point of contention between these two peoples. The only thing that mattered to Lothar was the fact that both capitals (Aix and Rome) were located within his territory, thus legitimizing the title of Emperor.<br />
 <br />
Meanwhile, the Normands pillage Nantes and lower Aquitaine. Charles laid siege to Toulouse in vain (May to July 844). The Normands led by Ragnar Lodbrog arrive in Paris and must be heavily bribed to leave. Other Normand armies ravage Toulouse and Bordeaux (burned to the ground in 848). On 6 May 848, Duke Nomenoe proclaims the indepence of the Church of Bretagne and the following year proclaims himself King of Bretagne. Charles fought Brittany (Bretagne) in 845-851 and was victorious. Not liking Pepin II, the people of Aquitaine request Charles' help, and he obliges by accepting the Crown, and on 6 June 848 is consecrated King of Aquitaine, though he could not defend his kingdom against the Normands. He had Charles of Aquitaine jailed (849 in Corbie). In 850 Charles attacks Bretagne and leaves a garrison in Rennes. No sooner does he leave, that Nomenoe takes the city and then takes Nantes as well. The next year, Nomenoe ravages Maine, but, fortunately for Charles, the King of Bretagne dies suddenly on 7 March in Vendome. Charles has Pepin II locked in the Monastery of Saint-Medard de Soissons in 852. The Normands under Godfrid pillage Tours and Angers and penetrate via the Valley of Escaut all the way to the Seine. The loyalty of Aquitaine shifts in 853, and Louis the German is called upon to help against Charles le Chauve. He in turn defeats Louis and offers Aquitaine his son by Ermentrude, Charles, who would be crowned sovereign in Limoges in October 855. Both Pepin II and Charles d'Aquitaine escape raise armies against Charles le Chauve. Charles fought against Louis for Lorraine (859, 870 [Treaty of Mersen] and 875).<br />
 <br />
When Louis le Germanique becomes ill in 869 near Rastisbonne, shortly after his nephew Lothar II died, Charles see the opportunity to claim his heritage as Uncle of the deceased. He has himself annointed King of Lorraine in Metz on 9 September, by the Bishop Hincmar. In March, 867, Charles d'Aquitaine dies, and his father Charles le Chauve is recognized as King by the Assembly in Pouilly-sur-Loire. Upon the death of his nephew, Lothar II on 8 August 869, Charles sped to Lotharingia and had himself crowned King of Lotharingia annointed on 9 September in the cathedral at Metz by Bishop Adventius of Metz and Archbishop Hincmar of Rheims. In 9 August 870, through the Treaty of Meerseen, Louis "Le Germanique" and Charles "Le Chauve" reach an agreeable compromise whereby they divide the lands of Lothar II between themselves, leaving Louis II no part of the inheritance. As soon as Louis II died on 12 August 875, Charles rushed to Italy and received the imperial crown and is annointed by Pope John VIII on 25 December 875. In Pavia on 5 January 876, by acclamation of the counts and nobles of Italy, Charles becomes King of Italy. On 31 January 876, the Archbishop of Milan proclaims Charles as Emperor. The French ecclesiasticals and nobles, having some misgivings about Charles' ability to take care of his Kingdom meet in Ponthion. Charles joins them dressed in the attire of the Frankish King. As soon as they declare him elected and recognize his imperial authority, Charles donned the Byzantine crown, and purple vestment of emperor. When Louis le Germanique dies on 28 August 876, Charles claims Lorraine as his own. While on an expedition in Italy against the Sarrasins, through the specific request of Pope Jean VIII, Charles le Chauve dies at the foot of Mount Cenis.<br />
 <br />
Married on 13 Dec 842 in Quierzy-sur-Oise, Aisne, Ile-de-France, France: Ermentrude d'Orleans , daughter of Odon=Eudes, Count d'Orleans and Ingeltrude de Paris; Ermentrude was crowned Queen of France in 866, having already produced a number of children including 6 sons but none of them was satisfactory as far as Charles Le Chauve was concerned. By September 866, four of them were dead.<br />
 <br />
Married on 25 Nov 869 in Aix-la-Chapelle, France: Richilde de Bourgogne, daughter of Beuve=Bouin, Comte de Bourgogne and Richilde d'Arles; The honeymoon is short-lived, as Louis le Germanique demands, as part of his heritage from the death of his nephew Lothar II, a part of Lorraine. Died: on 6 Oct 877 in Avrieux, Dauphine, France, at age 54 Charles II is buried at Saint Denis although originally he was buried in Nantua. Before expiring, he named his son, Louis Le Begue as his successor, and the Empress Richilde, crowned by Pope Jean VIII earlier that year, is charged with taking the royal garbs and sword to her step-son.<br />

 <br />
Charles the Bald (Charles II of France and Holy Roman Emperor Charles II) (French: Charles le Chauve) (823-877), Holy Roman Emperor and king of the West Franks, was the son of emperor Louis the Pious and his second wife Judith. He was born on June 13, 823, when his elder brothers were already adults and had been assigned their own regna, or subkingdoms, by their father. The attempts made by Louis the Pious to assign Charles a subkingdom, first Alemannia (829), then the country between the Meuse and the Pyrenees (839), at the expense of his half-brothers Lothair and Louis the German led to a rising on the part of these two against the emperor.<br />
 <br />
The death of the emperor in 840 led to the outbreak of war between his sons. Charles allied himself with his brother Louis the German to resist the pretensions of the new emperor Lothair I, and the two allies defeated Lothair at Fontenoy-en-Puisaye on June 25, 841. In the following year, the two brothers confirmed their alliance by the celebrated oaths of Strassburg. The war was brought to an end by the treaty of Verdun in August 843. The settlement gave Charles the Bald the kingdom of the western Franks, which practically corresponded with what is now France, as far as the Meuse, the Saône and the Rhone, with the addition of the Spanish March as far as the Ebro. Louis received the eastern part of the old Empire, hence known as the East Frankish Empire. Lothair retained the imperial title and the central regions from Flanders through the Rhineland and Burgundy into northern Italy.<br />
 <br />
The first years of Charles' reign, up to the death of Lothair I in 855, were comparatively peaceful. During these years the three brothers continued the system of "confraternal government", meeting repeatedly with one another, at Koblenz (848), at Meerssen (851), and at Attigny (854). In 858, Louis the German, invited by disaffected nobles eager to oust Charles, invaded the western Frankish kingdom. Charles' was so unpopular that he was unable to summon an army, and he fled to Burgundy. He was saved only by the support of the bishops, who refused to crown Louis king, and by the fidelity of the Welfs, who were related to his mother, Judith. In 860 he in his turn tried to seize the kingdom of his nephew, Charles of Provence, but was repulsed. On the death of his nephew Lothair II in 869, Charles tried to seize Lothair's dominions, but by the treaty of Meerssen (870) was compelled to share them with Louis the German.<br />
 <br />
Besides these family disputes, Charles had to struggle against repeated rebellions in Aquitaine and against the Bretons. Led by their chiefs Nomenoë and Erispoë, who defeated the king at Ballon (845) and Juvardeil (851), the Bretons were somewhat successful. Charles also fought against the Normans, who devastated the country in the north of Gaul, the valleys of the Seine and Loire, and even up to the borders of Aquitaine. Several times Charles was forced to purchase their retreat at a heavy price. Charles led various expeditions against the invaders, and tried to put a barrier in their way by having fortified bridges built over all the rivers.<br />
 <br />
In 875, after the death of the Emperor Louis II (son of his half-brother Lothair), Charles the Bald, supported by Pope John VIII, traveled to Italy, receiving the royal crown at Pavia and the imperial insignia in Rome on (December 29). Louis the German, also a candidate for the succession of Louis II, revenged himself by invading and devastating Charles' dominions, and Charles had to return hastily to Francia. After the death of Louis the German (August 28, 876), Charles in his turn attempted to seize Louis' kingdom, but was decisively beaten at Andernach on October 8, 876. In the meantime, John VIII, menaced by the Saracens, was urging Charles to come to his defence in Italy. Charles again crossed the Alps, but this expedition was received with little enthusiasm by the nobles, and even by his brother-in-law Boso, who had been entrusted by Charles with the government of Lombardy, and they refused to join his army. At the same time Carloman, son of Louis the German, entered northern Italy. Charles, ill and in great distress, started on his way back to Gaul, but died while crossing the pass of Mont Cenis at Brides-les-Bain, France, on the 5th or 6th of October 877.<br />
 <br />
Charles was succeeded by his son, Louis, the child of Ermentrude, daughter of Odo, Count of Orleans, whom Charles had married in 842 and who had died in 869. In 870 Charles had married Richilde, who was descended from a noble family of Lorraine, but none of the children he had with her played a part of any importance. Charles seems to have been a prince of education and letters, a friend of the church, and conscious of the support he could find in the episcopate against his unruly nobles, for he chose his councillors from among the higher clergy, as in the case of Guenelon of Sens, who betrayed him, or of Hincmar of Reims.<br />

Gaut, Gauti and Guti are name forms based on the same Proto-Germanicroot. Gapt is by many considered to be a corruption of Gaut(Gaut?Gavt?Gaft?Gapt, cf. eftir and eptir, "after" in Old Norse).<br />
 <br />
The names may represent the eponymous founder of an early tribe, *G(a)utoniz (?), ancestral to the Gautar (Geats), Gutans (Goths) and Gutar (Gotlanders). Gaut was one of Odin's names and the name forms are thought to be echoes of an ancient ancestry tradition among Germanic tribes, such as that of Yngvi and the Ingaevones.<br />
 <br />
Some versions of the English royal line of Wessex add names above that of Woden, purportedly giving Woden's ancestry, though the names are now usually thought be in fact another royal lineage that has been at some stage erroneously pasted onto the top of the standard genealogy. Some of these genealogies end in Geat, whom it is reasonable to think might be Gaut. The account in the Historia Britonum calls Geat a son of a god which fits. But Asser in his Life of Alfred writes instead that the pagans worshipped this Geat himself for a long time as a god. In Old Norse texts Gaut is itself a very common byname for Odin.<br />
 <br />
Jordanes in The origin and deeds of the Goths traces the line of the Amelungs up to Hulmul son of Gapt, purportedly the first Gothic hero of record. This Gapt is felt by many commentators to be an error for Gaut or Gauti.<br />
 <br />
The Gutasaga, which treats the history of Gotland before its Christianization, begins with Tielvar and his son Havde, who had three sons, Graip, Guti and Gunfjaun, who were the ancestors of the Gotlanders, the Gutar (which is originally the same name as Goths).<br />

Philip III the Bold ( French: Philippe III le Hardi) (April 3, 1245 - October 5, 1285) reigned as King of France from 1270 to 1285. A member of the Capetian dynasty, he was born in Poissy, the son of Louis IX of France and of Marguerite Berenger of Provence (1221 - 1295).<br />

 <br />
In 1285, the last year of his reign, Philip, in order to help his uncle Charles, who had lost Sicily to King Pedro III of Aragon, made an unsuccessful attempt to conquer Aragon. In the aftermath of this struggle, while retreating from Girona, Philippe III died on October 5, 1285 at Perpignan (in the present-day département of Pyrénées-Orientales). He lies buried with his wife, Isabella of Aragon (1247 - 1271) in Saint Denis Basilica.<br />

King Edward I of England (June 17, 1239 - July 7, 1307), popularly knownas "Longshanks" because of his 6 foot 2 inch frame and the "Hammer of theScots" (his tombstone, in Latin, read, Hic est Edwardvs Primus ScottorumMalleus, "Here lies Edward I, Hammer of the Scots"), achieved fame as themonarch who conquered Wales and who kept Scotland under Englishdomination. He reigned from 1272 to 1307, ascending the throne of Englandon November 21, 1272 after the death of his father, King Henry III ofEngland.<br />
 <br />
Edward was born at the Palace of Westminster on June 17 or 18, 1239. He married twice; his first marriage was to Eleanor of Castile which produced sixteen children, and her death in 1290 affected Edward deeply. He displayed his grief by erecting the Eleanor crosses, one at each place where her funeral cortege stopped for the night. His second marriage was to Marguerite of France (known as the "Pearl of France" by her English subjects), the daughter of King Philippe III of France (Phillip the Bold) and Maria of Brabant, produced three children.<br />
 <br />
Edward's character greatly contrasted that of his father, who reigned in England throughout Edward's childhood and consistently tended to favour compromise with his opponents. Edward had already shown himself as an ambitious and impatient man, displaying considerable military prowess in defeating Simon de Montfort at the Battle of Evesham in 1265. He gained a reputation for treating rebels and other foes with great savagery. He relentlessly pursued the surviving members of the de Montfort family, his cousins. In 1270 he travelled to Tunis, intending to fight in the Eighth Crusade alongside Louis IX of France, who died before Edward arrived; Edward instead travelled to Acre, in the Ninth Crusade. While in the Holy Land his father died; Edward arrived back in England in 1274.<br />
 <br />
One of Edward's early achievements was the conquest of Wales. Under the 1267 Treaty of Montgomery, Llewelyn ap Gruffydd (meaning 'Like a Lion') had extended Welsh territories southwards into what had been the lands of the English Marcher lords, and gained the title of Prince of Wales although he still owed homage to the English monarch as overlord. Edward refused to recognise the Treaty which had been concluded by his father. In 1275, pirates in Edward's pay intercepted a ship carrying Eleanor de Montfort, Simon de Montfort's only daughter, from France (where her family had lived in exile) to Wales, where she expected to marry Llywelyn the Last, then ruler of the principality. The parties' families had arranged the marriage previously, when an alliance with Simon de Montfort still counted politically. However, Llywelyn wanted the marriage largely to antagonise his long-standing enemy, Edward. With the hijacking of the ship, Edward gained possession of Eleanor and imprisoned her at Windsor. After Llywelyn repeatedly refused to pay homage to Edward in 1274-5, Edward raised an army and launched his first campaign against the Welsh prince in 1276-77. After this campaign Llywelyn was forced to pay homage to Edward and was stripped of all but a rump of territory in Gwynedd. But Edward allowed Llywelyn to retain the title of Prince of Wales, and the marriage with Eleanor de Montfort went ahead.<br />
 <br />
However, Llywelyn's younger brother, Dafydd (who had briefly been an ally of the English) started another rebellion in 1282. Llywelyn died shortly afterwards in a skirmish. Subsequently, Edward destroyed the remnants of resistance, capturing, brutally torturing and executing Dafydd in the following year. To consolidate his conquest, he commenced the construction of a string of massive stone castles encircling the principality, of which Caernarfon Castle provides a notable surviving example. Wales became incorporated into England under the Statute of Rhuddlan in 1284 and in 1301 Edward created his eldest son Edward Prince of Wales, since which time the eldest son of each English monarch has borne the same title.<br />
 <br />
To help finance his war to conquer Wales, Edward I taxed the Jewish moneylenders. However, the cost of Edward's ambitions soon drained the money-lenders dry. When the Jews could no longer pay, the state accused them of disloyalty. Already restricted to a limited number of occupations, Edward furthermore abolished their right to lend money at interest, [1] and eventually restricted their extra-curricular movements and activities. Edward decreed that all Jews wear a yellow patch in the shape of a star attached to their outer clothing to identify them in public (compare Star of David, Yellow badge).<br />
 <br />
In the course of King Edward's persecution of the Jews, he arrested all the heads of Jewish households. The authorities took over 300 of them to the Tower of London and executed them, while killing others in their homes. Finally, in 1290, the King banished all Jews from the country.<br />
 <br />
Edward then turned his attentions to Scotland and on May 10, 1291 Scottish nobles recognised the authority of Edward I. He had planned to marry off his son to the child queen, Margaret of Scotland (Called 'The Maid of Norway') but when Margaret died the Scottish nobles agreed to have Edward select her successor from the various claimants to the throne, and he chose John Balliol over other candidates. Edward was anxious to impose his overlordship on Scotland and hoped that John Balliol would prove the most biddable candidate. Indeed, Edward summoned John Balliol to do homage to him in Westminster in 1293 and made it clear he expected John's military and financial support against France. But this was too much for Balliol, who concluded a pact with France and prepared an army to invade England.<br />
 <br />
Edward gathered his largest army yet and razed Berwick, massacring its inhabitants, proceeding to Dunbar and Edinburgh. The Stone of Destiny was removed from Scone Palace and taken to Westminster Abbey. Until 1996, it formed the seat on King Edward's Chair, on which all English monarchs since 1308 have been crowned, with the exception of Mary I. In 1996, the stone was returned to Scotland, to return only during royal coronations. Balliol renounced the crown and was imprisoned in the Tower of London for three years before withdrawing to his estates in France. All freeholders in Scotland were required to swear an oath of homage to Edward, and he ruled Scotland like a province through English Viceroys.<br />
 <br />
Opposition sprang up (see Wars of Scottish Independence), and Edward executed the focus of discontent, William Wallace, on August 23, 1305, having earlier defeated him at the Battle of Falkirk (1298). His plan to unite the two countries never came to fruition during his lifetime, however, and he died in 1307 at Burgh-by-Sands, Cumberland on the Scottish border, while on his way to wage another campaign against the Scots under the leadership of Robert the Bruce. Against his wishes, Edward was buried in Westminster Abbey. His son, King Edward II of England, succeeded him.<br />

Marguerite of France (1282 - 14 February 1317) was a daughter of PhilipIII of France and Maria of Brabant. She was also the second Queen consortof King Edward I of England.<br />
 <br />
Three years after the death of his beloved first wife, Eleanor of Castile, at the age of 48 in 1290, Edward I was still grieving. But news got to him of the beauty of Blanche, sister to King Philip IV of France. Edward decided that he would marry Blanche at any cost and sent out emissaries to negotiate the marriage with Philip. Philip agreed to give Blanche to Edward on the following conditions:<br />
   1. a truce was concluded between the two countries<br />
   2. Edward gave up the province of Gascony<br />
 <br />
Edward, surprisingly, agreed and sent his brother Edmund Crouchback, Duke of Lancaster, to fetch the new bride. Edward had been deceived, for Blanche was to be married to Rudolph I of Bohemia and eldest son of Albert I of Germany. Instead Philip offered his younger sister Marguerite, a young girl of 11, to marry Edward (then 55). Upon hearing this, Edward declared war on France, refusing to marry Marguerite. After five years, a truce was agreed, under the terms of which Edward would marry Marguerite and would regain the key city of Guienne, and receive the £15,000 owed to Marguerite from her father, King Philip III the Bold.<br />
 <br />
Edward was now 60 years old. The wedding took place at Canterbury on September 8, 1299. Edward soon returned to the Scottish border to continue his campaigns and left Marguerite in London. After several months, bored and lonely, the young queen decided to join her husband. Nothing could have pleased the king more, for Marguerite's actions reminded him of his first wife Eleanor, who had had two of her sixteen children abroad.<br />
 <br />
Marguerite soon became firm friends with her stepdaughter Mary, a nun, who was two years older than the young queen. In less than a year Marguerite gave birth to a son, and then another a year later. It is said that many who fell under the king's wrath were saved from too stern a punishment by the queen's influence over her husband, and the statement, Pardoned solely on the intercession of our dearest consort, queen Marguerite of England, appears.<br />
 <br />
In all, Marguerite gave birth to three children: Thomas of Brotherton, 1st Earl of Norfolk; Edmund of Woodstock, 1st Earl of Kent; and a daughter, named Eleanor in honor of Edward's first queen, who perished in infancy.<br />
 <br />
The mismatched couple were blissfully happy. When Blanche died in 1306 (her husband never became Emperor), Edward ordered all the court to go into mourning to please his queen. He had realised the wife he had gained was "a pearl of great price". The same year Marguerite gave birth to a girl, Eleanor, a choice of name which surprised many, and showed Marguerite's un-jealous nature. After Edward died, as a widow at twenty six, she never remarried saying "when Edward died, all men died for me", but she used her immense dowry to relieve people's suffering.<br />

Pharamond (c. 370 - c. 430) is considered to be the first king of theSalian Franks, though he is possibly a legendary rather than historicalfigure. He was possibly a son or son-in-law of Marcomer.<br />
 <br />
Only the later century historicians Prosper Tyron and Dom Bouquet give a report about his reign. In 420, he reportedly led his people in crossing the Rhine River and heading west. This movement would effectively separate his tribe from the majority of the Rhinefranks that had settled near Cologne. Pharamond was eventually succeeded by his son Clodio. His wife was Argotta.<br />

Abbie (Shaw) Young, a highly respected and much beloved resident ofWaterville, passed away at her home, on the morning of March 27th. Shewas 75 years of age, having been born on June 5th, 1850, and was theyoungest of a family of seven children of the late Sydney and Caroline(Skinner) Shaw, whose home was in Waterville, where the early years ofthe deceased were spent.<br />
She first married John L. West of Morristown, and went to reside in Kansas, where one son, Claude L., who survives her was born to them, his father dying when he was about 3 years of age. Mrs. West then returned to her home in Waterville, where she married Mr. W. V. T. Young, nearly 50 years ago. Five children were born to them, of whom three survive, LeRoy, of New York and Sydney, of Winnipeg, Man., having predeceased her a few years ago. The surviving ones are Claude L. West, of Newark, N.J.; Mrs. Allen Young, Swampscott, Mass.; Mrs. Owen Craig, of Vulcan, Alberta, and Vaughn, who resides in Waterville. Eleven grandchildren also survive.<br />
The funeral took place from the Baptist Church, of which she was a faithful member, Rev. G. R. T. Ayling officiating, assisted by Rev. John MCI of the United Church.<br />
The floral offerings were most beautiful and especially appropriate, as the deceased was always a lover of flowers and as long as she was able kept herself surrounded by them in her home. Her eyesight had failed her during the last few years and her only complaint was of missing the eight of the beautiful things of earth. A loving friend and neighbor has passed from our midst, sweet memories of whom will ever remain with those who knew her.<br />
The husband, children and grandchildren have the sincere sympathy of a large circle of friends.<br />

From Wikipedia<br />
 <br />
Saint Clotilde (475 - 545 in Tours), also spelled as Clotilda, Clotild, Clothilde, or Chlothilde, was the daughter of Burgundian king Chilperic. Her uncle was the Burgundian king and Roman general Gundobad. Clotilde was the wife of Clovis I and contributed to her husband's conversion to Catholic christianity.<br />
 <br />
On the death of Gundioc, king of the Burgundians, in 473, his sons Gundobad, Godegesil and Chilperic divided his heritage between them; Chilperic apparently reigning at Lyons, Gundobald at Vienne and Godegesil at Geneva.<br />
 <br />
According to Gregory of Tours, Chilperic was slain by Gundobad, his wife drowned, and of his two daughters, Chrona took the veil and Clotilde was exiled. This account, however, seems to have been a later invention, since an epitaph discovered at Lyons speaks of a Burgundian queen who died in 506. This was most probably the mother of Clotilde.<br />
 <br />
In 493 Clotilde married Clovis, King of the Franks, who had just conquered northern Gaul. She was brought up in the Catholic faith and did not rest until her husband had abjured paganism and embraced the Catholic faith in 496. With him she built at Paris the church of the Holy Apostles, afterwards known as Sainte Geneviève. After the death of Clovis in 511 she retired to the abbey of St Martin at Tours.<br />
 <br />
In 523 she incited her sons against her cousin Sigismund, the son of Gundobad and provoked the Burgundian war. In the following year she tried in vain to protect the rights of her grandsons, the children of Clodomer, against the claims of her sons Childebert I and Clotaire I, and was equally unsuccessful in her efforts to prevent the civil discords between her children. She died in 544 or 545, and was buried at her husband's side in the church of the Holy Apostles.<br />

Cloderic is same as Childeric<br />
 <br />
"Rulers of the World" by R.F.Tapsell<br />
Between 458 and 480: Childeric I became the third King of the Franks in 458. He fought with the Roman Aegidius against the Wisigoths. When Agidius died in 464, he was succeeded by Count Paul. Childeric I's army helped Count Paul push back a Saxon advance from Angers around 466. Count Paul would die in 470. They had to repeat this feat around 475, after Count Paul had died and the Saxons once again had attempted to expand into Angers.<br />

 <br />
Childeric I (c. 437- c. 482) was the Merovingian king of the Salian Franks from 457 until his death.<br />
[edit]<br />
 <br />
Reign<br />
 <br />
He succeeded his father Merovech (Latinised as Meroveus or Merovius) as king, traditionally in 457 or 458. With his Frankish warband he was established with his capital at Tournai, on lands which he had received as a foederatus of the Romans, and for some time he kept the peace with his allies.<br />
 <br />
In about 463 at Orléans, in conjunction with the Roman General Aegidius, who was based at Soissons, he defeated the Visigoths, who hoped to extend their dominion along the banks of the Loire River; after the death of Aegidius he first assisted Comes ("count") Paul of Angers in a mixed band of Gallo-Romans and Franks, defeating the Goths and taking booty. Odoacer reached Angers but Childeric arrived the next day and a battle ensued. Count Paul was killed and Childeric took the city. Childeric having delivered Angers, he followed a Saxon warband to the islands at the Atlantic mouth of the Loire, and massacred them there. In a change of alliances, he also joined forces with Odoacer, according to Gregory of Tours, to stop a band of the Alamanni who wished to invade Italy.<br />
 <br />
These are all the facts known about him, and they are not secure. The stories of his expulsion by the Franks, whose women he was taking; of his stay of eight years in Thuringia with King Basin and his wife Basine; of his return when a faithful servant advised him that he could safely do so by sending to him half of a piece of gold which he had broken with him; and of the arrival at Tournai of Queen Basine, whom he married, are entirely legendary and come from Gregory of Tours' Historia Francorum (Book ii.12).<br />
 <br />
He died in 481 and was buried at his capital, Tournai, leaving a son Clovis, afterwards king of the Franks.<br />
 <br />
His Tomb<br />
Childeric's tomb was discovered in 1653, by a mason doing repairs at the church of Saint-Brice in Tournai when numerous precious objects were found, a richly ornamented sword, a torse-like bracelet, jewels of gold and cloisonné enamel with garnets, gold coins, a gold bull's head and a ring with the inscription CHILDERICI REGIS ("of Childeric the king"), which identified the tomb. Some 300 golden bees were also in the find. Archduke Leopold William, Spanish governor of the Netherlands, had the find published in Latin, and the treasure went first to the Habsburgs in Vienna, then as a gift to Louis XIV, who was not impressed with them and stored them in the royal library, which became the Bibliothèque National at the Revolution. Napoleon was more impressed with Childeric's bees: looking for a heraldic symbol to trump the Bourbon fleur-de-lys, he settled on Childeric's bees as symbols of the French Empire.<br />
 <br />
On the night of November 5-6, 1831, the treasure of Childeric was among 80 kilos of treasure stolen from the Library and melted down for the gold. A few pieces were retrieved where they had been hidden in the Seine, including two of the bees, but record of the treasure now exists only in the fine engravings made at the time of its discovery, and in some reproductions made for the Habsburgs.<br />

 <br />
Meroveus (c. 411-456) (Mérovée in French, Merovech, sometimes Latinised as Meroveus or Merovius) was a chief of the Salian Franks from 448-456. He is considered a semi-legendary individual, as not much information exists about him. Gregory of Tours records him but it is not clear if he was the son of Clodian or a leader who assumed power on Clodian's death.<br />
 <br />
His descendants called themselves Merovingians, as the founder of what is referred to as the Merovingian Dynasty.<br />
 <br />
Some researchers have noted that Merovech, the Frankish chieftain, may have been the namesake of a certain god or demigod honored by the Franks prior to their conversion to Christianity, a being described as part human, part bull and part sea-creature.<br />
 <br />
Meroveus is the father of Childeric I who succeeded him.<br />

From Wikipedia<br />
 <br />
William II (called "Rufus", perhaps because of his red-faced appearance) (c. 1056-August 2, 1100) was the second son of William the Conqueror and was King of England from 1087 until 1100, with powers also over Normandy, and influence in Scotland. He was less successful in extending his control in Wales.<br />
 <br />
Although William was an effective soldier, he was a ruthless ruler and was little liked by those he governed; according to the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, he was "hated by almost all his people." However, it is not surprising that the chroniclers of his time took a dim view of Rufus, because many literate men of the day were men of the Church, against which Rufus fought hard and long, and in Norman tradition William Rufus scorned the Anglo-Saxons and their culture. (Cantor 1993, p 280)<br />
 <br />
William himself seems to have been a flamboyant character, and his reign was marked by his bellicose temperament. He never married or had illegitimate children; William's favourite was Ranulf Flambard, whom he appointed Bishop of Durham in 1099, an appointment based on political requirements, for a see that was at the same time a great feudal fief. It has been suggested that William was homosexual.<br />
Early years<br />
 <br />
William's exact date of birth is unknown, but it was some time between the years 1056 and 1060. He was born in his father's duchy of Normandy, which would be inherited in due course by his elder brother, Robert Curthose, a third son during his youth, educated under the eye of Lanfranc and destined to be a great lord but not a king, until the death of the Conqueror's second son put him in the line of succession. His father's favourite son, William succeeded to the throne of England on his father's death, but there was always hostility between him and his eldest brother, though they became reconciled after an attempted coup in 1091 by their youngest brother, Henry.<br />
 <br />
Relations between the three brothers had never been excellent; Orderic Vitalis relates an incident that took place at Laigle, in 1077 or 1078. William and Henry, having grown bored with casting dice, decided to make mischief by pouring fetid water on their brother Robert from an upper gallery, thusly infuriating and shaming him. A brawl broke out, and their father King William was forced to intercede and restore order.<br />
 <br />
Appearance<br />
According to William of Malmesbury, William Rufus was "thickset and muscular with a protruding belly; a dandy dressed in the height of fashion, however outrageous, he wore his blond hair long, parted in the centre and off the face so that his forehead was bare; and in his red, choleric face were eyes of changeable colour, speckled with flecks of light" (Barlow).<br />
 <br />
England and France<br />
The division of William the Conqueror's lands into two parts presented a dilemma for those nobles who held land on both sides of the Channel. Since the younger William and Robert were natural rivals, these nobles worried that they could not hope to please both of their lords, and thus ran the risk of losing the favor of one ruler or the other (or both of them). The only solution, as they saw it, was to unite England and Normandy once more under one ruler. The pursuit of this aim led them to revolt against William in favor of Robert in the Rebellion of 1088, under the leadership of the powerful Bishop Odo of Bayeux, who was a half-brother of William the Conqueror. Robert failed to appear in England to rally huis supporters, and William won the support of the English with silver and promises of better government, and defeated the rebellion, thus securing his authority. In 1090 he invaded Normandy, crushing Robert's forces and forcing him to cede a portion of his lands. The two made up their differences and William agreed to help Robert recover lands lost to France, notably Maine.<br />
 <br />
Thus William Rufus was secure in the most powerful kingdom in Europe (with the contemporary eclipse of the Salian Emperors) and, within England, the least tramelled by feudal obligations. As in Normandy, his bishops and abbots were bound to him by feudal obligations, and his right of investitute in the Norman tradition was unquestioned within the kingdom during the age of the Investiture Controversy that brought excommunication upon the Salian Emperor Henry IV. Anglo-Norman royal institutions reached an efficiency unknown in medieval Europe, and the king's personal power through an effective and loyal chancery penetrated to the local level to an extent unmatched in France. Without the Capetians' ideological trappings of an anointed monarchy forever entngled with the hierarchy of the Church, the King's administration and the King's law unified the kingdom, rendering trhe English King relatively impervious to papal codemnation, as the reign of William Rufus demonstrated.<br />
 <br />
Power struggles<br />
William Rufus inherited the Anglo-Norman settlement whose details are reflected in Domesday Book (1086), a survey that could not have been undertaken anywhere in Europe at that time and a signal of the control of the monarchy, but he did not inherit William's charisma and political skills. Within a few years he lost William's advisor and confidant, the Italian-Norman archbishop of Canterbury, Lanfranc, in 1089.<br />
 <br />
Much of William's reign was spent feuding with the church; after the death of Lanfranc, he delayed appointing a new archbishop while he appropriated ecclesiastical revenues in the interim, which was protracted, and for this he was much criticised. Finally, in a time of panic during William's serious illness in 1093 another Norman-Italian was made Archbishop of Canterbury, Anselm of Bec the greatest theologian of his generation, and this led to a long period of animosity between church and state. Anselm was a stronger supporter of the Gregorian reforms in the Church than Lanfranc had been. William and Anselm disagreed on a range of ecclesiastical issues, and the English clergy, beholden to the king for their preferments and livings were unable to support Anselm publicly. William called a council at Rockingham in 1095 to bring Anselm to heel but the churcvhman appealed to Rome. In October 1097, Anselm went into exile, taking his case to the Pope. The new pope was the diplomatic and flexible Cluniac Urban II who was not in a position to make further royal enemies. The Emperor of Germany supported an antipope, and Urban came to a concordat with William Rufus: William recognized Urban as pope and Urban gave sanction to the Anglo-Norma ecclesiastical status quo. William was able to claim the revenues of the archbishopric of Canterbury as long as Anselm remained in exile, and Anselm remained in exile until the reign of William's successor, Henry I.<br />
 <br />
William Rufus was less capable than his father at channeling the Norman lords' propensity for indiscipline and violence. In 1095, Robert de Mowbray, the earl of Northumbria, would not come to William's Curia Regis the thrice-annual court where decisions were made and delivered to the great lords, and William subsequently led an army against him and defeated him; the earl was dispossessed and imprisoned. Another noble, William of Eu, was also accused of treachery and blinded and castrated. That same year, William II also made an unsuccessful foray into Wales. He tried again in 1097 with an equal lack of success. He returned to Normandy in 1097 and from then until 1099 campaigned in France, securing and holding northern Maine but failing to seize the French-controlled part of the Vexin region. At the time of his death he was planning to occupy Aquitaine in south-western France.<br />
 <br />
William also quarrelled with the Scottish king, Malcolm III, forcing him to pay homage in 1091 and seizing the border city of Carlisle and Cumbria in 1092. At the Battle of Alnwick, November 13, 1093 Malcolm and his son were slain; William gained effective control of the Scottish throne after Malcolm's death, when he backed a successful bid by Edgar Atheling to dethrone Malcolm III's brother Donald Bane in favor of his nephew, also named Edgar. The newly crowned King Edgar, who ruled Scotland from 1097 to 1107, thus owed his position to William.<br />
 <br />
In 1096, William's brother Robert Curthose joined the First Crusade. He needed money to fund this venture and pledged his duchy to William in return for a payment of 10,000 marks; a sum equalling about one-fourth of William's annual revenue. In a display of the effectiveness of Norman taxation inaugurated by the Conqueror, William raised the money by levying a special, heavy, and much-resented tax upon the whole of England. William then ruled Normandy as regent in Robert's absence-Robert did not return until September 1100, one month after William's death.<br />
 <br />
The Court of William II<br />
William Rufus had a notorious disregard for the church; his most passionate detractors are found among clergymen. Eadmer relates two incidents in which William Rufus either convinced converted Jews to return to Judaism, or attempted to do so. During his quarrels with Anselm of Canterbury, the king declared that "he hated him much yesterday, that he hated him much today, and that he would hate him more and more tomorrow and every other day."<br />
 <br />
William of Malmesbury decries William Rufus' court, which he describes as being filled by "effeminate" young men in extravagent clothes mincing about in "shoes with curved points". Orderic Vitalis makes mention of the "fornicators and sodomites" who held favor during William Rufus' reign, and remarks approvingly that when Henry became king, one of his first acts was to have his courtiers shorn of their long hair.<br />
 <br />
 <br />
The unusual death of William II<br />
Perhaps the most memorable event in the life of William Rufus was his death, which occurred while William was hunting in the New Forest. He was killed by an arrow through the heart, but the circumstances remain unclear.<br />
 <br />
On a bright August day in 1100, William organised a hunting trip in the New Forest. An account by Orderic Vitalis described the preparations for the hunt:<br />
 <br />
    ...an armourer came in and presented to him (Rufus) six arrows. The King immediately took them with great satisfaction, praising the work, and unconscious of what was to happen, kept four of them himself and held out the other two to Walter Tyrrel... saying It is only right that the sharpest be given to the man who knows how to shoot the deadliest shots.<br />
 <br />
On the subsequent hunt, the party spread out as they chased their prey, and William, in the company of Walter Tirel (or Tyrell), Lord of Poix, became separated from the others. It was the last time that William was seen alive.<br />
 <br />
William was found the next day by a group of local peasants lying dead in the woods with an arrow piercing his lungs. William's body was abandoned by the nobles at the place where he fell, because the law and order of the kingdom died with the king, and they had to flee to their English or Norman estates to secure their interests. Legend has it that it was left to a local charcoal-burner named Purkis to take the king's body to Winchester Cathedral on his cart.<br />
 <br />
According to the chroniclers, William's death was not murder. Walter and William had been hunting together when Walter let loose a wild shot that, instead of hitting the stag he aimed for, struck William in the chest. Walter tried to help him, but there was nothing he could do. Fearing that he would be charged with murder, Walter panicked, leapt onto his horse, and fled. A version of this tale is given by William of Malmesbury in his Chronicle of the Kings of the English (c. 1128):<br />
 <br />
    The day before the king died he dreamt that he went to heaven. He suddenly awoke. He commanded a light to be brought, and forbade his attendants to leave him. The next day he went into the forest... He was attended by a few persons... Walter Tirel remained with him, while the others, were on the chase. The sun was now declining, when the king, drawing his bow and letting fly an arrow, slightly wounded a stag which passed before him... The stag was still running... The king, followed it a long time with his eyes, holding up his hand to keep off the power of the sun's rays. At this instant Walter decided to kill another stag. Oh, gracious God! the arrow pierced the king's breast.<br />
 <br />
    On receiving the wound the king uttered not a word; but breaking off the shaft of the arrow where it projected from his body... This accelerated his death. Walter immediately ran up, but as he found him senseless, he leapt upon his horse, and escaped with the utmost speed. Indeed there were none to pursue him: some helped his flight; others felt sorry for him.<br />
 <br />
    The king's body was placed on a cart and conveyed to the cathedral at Winchester... blood dripped from the body all the way. Here he was buried within the tower. The next year, the tower fell down. William Rufus died in 1100... aged forty years. He was a man much pitied by the clergy... he had a soul which they could not save... He was loved by his soldiers but hated by the people because he caused them to be plundered.<br />
 <br />
To some chroniclers, such an 'Act of God' was a just end for a wicked king. However, over the centuries, the obvious suggestion that one of William's many enemies may have had a hand in this extraordinary event has been repeatedly made. Even chroniclers of the time point out that Walter was renowned as a keen bowman, and unlikely to fire such an impetuous shot. And William's brother Henry, who was among the hunting party that day, benefitted directly from William's death, as he was shortly after crowned king.<br />
 <br />
Abbot Suger, another chronicler, was Tirel's friend and sheltered him in his French exile. He said later:<br />
 <br />
    It was laid to the charge of a certain noble, Walter Tirel, that he had shot the king with an arrow; but I have often heard him, when he had nothing to fear nor to hope, solemnly swear that on the day in question he was not in the part of the forest where the king was hunting, nor ever saw him in the forest at all.<br />

Clodio (c. 395 - 447 or 449) or, the Long-Haired or the Hairy, was a semi-legendary king of the Salian Franks from the Merovingian dynasty (426 - 447). His successor was Meroveus, after whom the dynasty was named. Legend has it that his father was duke Pharamond and his mother was Argotta, from Thuringia. His grandfather may have been Marcomer, a duke of the Franks.<br />
 <br />
There are basically only two sources of information for Clodio's history: the writings of Gregory of Tours and Sidonius Apollinaris.<br />
 <br />
Clodio lived in Dispargum, a name that is believed to be that of a castle, rather than a village. Around 431, he invaded the territory of Artois, but was defeated near Hesdin by Aetius, the commander of the Roman army in Gaul, Western Roman Empire. However, Clodio regrouped and soon was able to seize the town Cameracum. Eventually, he occupied all the country as far as the Somme River and making Tournai the capital of the Salian Franks.<br />
 <br />
Clodio's aggressive action to seize more territory led to centuries of expansion by his successors that ultimately created what we know today as the country of France. Clodio died sometime between 447 and 449 and power passed on to Meroveus. It is not known if Meroveus was his son or another chieftain of the tribe who ascended into the leadership role.<br />

Brunhilda (in German) or Brunehaut (in French) (534-613) was a Frankish queen who ruled the East Frankish kingdoms of Austrasia and Burgundy in the names of her sons and grandsons. Initially known as a liberal ruler of great political acumen she became notorious for her cruelty and avarice. In some histories she is known as Brunhilde, or Brunechildis.<br />
 <br />
She was born about 550, the daughter of the Visigoth king Athanagild of Spain and Ingonde, his queen. She married king Sigebert I of Austrasia, the grandson of Clovis, and joined him at Metz. Upon her marriage in 567 she abjured Arianism and converted to orthodox Roman Catholicism.<br />
 <br />
Sigebert's father Clotaire had reunited the four kingdoms of France but when he died Sigebert and his three brothers divided them again. Sigebert ruled Austrasia and later shared Paris with his two surviving brothers when Charibert died in 570.<br />
 <br />
Brunehaut's sister Galswintha married Sigebert's brother Chilperic I of the West Frankish kingdom of Neustria and Soissons in 567. He is thought to have proposed because he envied the attention garnered to his brother by the marriage to Brunehaut and he had Galswintha murdered within the year at the behest of his mistress Fredegund, whom he then married. Brunehaut so detested Fredegund for the death of her sister and this hatred was so fiercely reciprocated that the two queens persuaded their husbands to wage war. Germanus, Bishop of Paris, negotiated a brief peace between them until Chilperic invaded the Sigebert's dominions. Sigebert defeated Chilperic, who fled to Tournai, and the people of Paris hailed him as a conqueror when he went there with Brunehaut and their children. Germanus wrote to Brunehaut, asking her to persuade her husband to restore the peace of France and to spare his brother. Chroniclers of Germanus' life say that she ignored this; certainly Sigebert set out to besiege Tournai. Fredegund responded to this threat to her husband by hiring two assassins, who killed Sigebert at Vitry with poisoned daggers. Brunehaut was captured and imprisoned at Rouen. She escaped "after a series of extraordinary adventures"1 by marrying Chilperic's son, Merovech.<br />
 <br />
Brunehaut now tried to seize the regency of Austrasia in the name of her son Childebert II but she was resisted fiercely by her nobles and had to retire to briefly to Burgundy before obtaining her goal. She ruled Austrasia until Childebert came of age in the early 580s. Upon his death in September or October 595 she attempted to govern Austrasia and Burgundy in the name of her grandsons Théodebert II and Theodoric II, respectively. She was exiled from Austrasia, and then persuaded Theodoric to attack his brother, whom he defeated at Toul and Tolbiac. Theodoric then had Théodebert and his family killed but himself died soon after. It was during these later regencies that Desiderius, Bishop of Vienne (later Saint Didier) publicly accused her of incest and cruelty. Desiderius finally enraged her with a pointed sermon on chastity preached in 612 before her and Theodoric, with whom she hired three assassins to murder him at the village now called Saint-Didier-sur-Chalaronne.<br />
 <br />
In 576 Sigebert's brother Guntram, King of Burgundy, founded a bishopric that was suffragan of Vienne at Maurienne, which belonged to the Diocese of Turin. The Bishop of Turin protested this to Brunehaut for more than twenty years but even when Pope Gregory the Great supported his complaint in 599 Brunehaut dismissed it. In general, however, she protected the church and treated Gregory with great respect. He wrote a series of positive letters to her; in 597 he wrote to her about interdicting pagan rites such as tree worship. Gregory of Tours was another favoured cleric; he was a trusted courtier to her and her son from 587 until his death. She also took a keen personal interest in the bishoprics and monasteries within her dominion. This brought her into conflict with Columbanus, abbot of Luxeuil, whom she eventually exiled.<br />
 <br />
When Theodoric died in 613 Brunehaut, now in her middle sixties, proclaimed one of her great-grandsons as king, but the nobles of Austrasia and Burgundy objected, rising in revolt against her, and called on Clotaire II, son of Fredegund, and king of most of France to help them. Brunehaut fled East, hoping to enlist the aid of the German tribes along the Rhine, but she was betrayed by the last of her followers, and delivered into the hands of her nephew and mortal enemy, Clotaire. Before a gathering of the nobility at Renève, Burgundy, he had her accused of causing many deaths, including those of ten kings and Desiderius, as well as several other churchmen. Brunehaut was condemned to death, and Clotaire brought the full force of his hatred and that of his deceased mother against their old foe: Brunehaut was put to slow torture, being stretched on the rack for three long days, before finally being chained between four horses and torn limb from limb, or, as some later stories would have it, tied to the tail of a wild mare and dragged to her death. According to the Liber Historiae Francorum:<br />
 <br />
    "Then the army of the Franks and Burgundians joined into one, all shouted together that death would be most fitting for the very wicked Brunhilda. Then King Clotaire ordered that she be lifted on to a camel and led through the entire army. Then she was tied to the feet of wild horses and torn apart limb from limb. Finally she died. Her final grave was the fire. Her bones were burnt."<br />
 <br />
One legend has her being dragged by a wild mare down the Roman road La Chaussée Brunehaut at Abbeville.<br />
 <br />
Brunehaut was buried in the Abbaye de St. Martin at Autun that she founded in 602 on the spot where the bishop of Tours had cut down a beech-tree that served as an object of pagan worship. The abbey, which was destroyed in 1793 and Brunehaut's sarcophagus is now in the Musee Lapidaire in Avignon.<br />
 <br />
Brunehaut commissioned the building of several churches and the abbey of St. Vincent at Laon (founded in 580). She is also credited with founding the castle of Bruniquel and having a Roman road resurfaced near Alligny-en-Morvan (where the name of a nearby hill Terreau Bruneau is believed to be derived from hers). The part of Mauves-sur-Loire known as la Fontaine Bruneau is named after Brunehaut who may have cooled herself with the fountain's water when she suffered heat exhaustion.<br />
 <br />
Her life seems to have been incorporated into the legend of the Valkirie Brynhild, and to have thus formed the basis for aspects of Wagner's Brunhilde.<br />

Athanagild (d. 567) was a Visigothic king of Spain.<br />
 <br />
With the help of a Roman force, including a fleet to watch the coasts, sent from Gaul in 551 by the Emperor of the East, Justinian, he defeated and killed his predecessor, King Agila, near Seville in 554. Athanagild then became king of the Goths in Spain. But the ports and coastal fortifications taken in the name of Athanagild were not swiftly turned over by his Byzantine allies. Athanagild was able to recover a few cities, but was forced to cede a large portion of Hispania Baetica (Andalusia) to a Byzantine governor, of high standing but advanced years, Liberius, who set about enlarging the gift. Athanagild then endeavoured to drive his Roman allies out of Iberia, but was unsuccessful. He had invited the establishment of a Byzantine enclave in the south of Iberia that would last for a further seventy years. It seems clear that the Roman population of Baetica was solidly behind this orthodox patrician Roman governor.<br />
 <br />
There are few details about this far western extension of Byzantine power, which is overlooked by Justinian's historians Procopius and Agathius. It straddled the Straits of Gades and included major cities: New Carthage (Cartagena), Corduba (Córdoba), and Assionia.<br />
 <br />
Although throughout his rule he had to fight the Byzantines, the Franks, and the Suevi, and was harassed in the Pyrenees by the Basques, Athanagild strengthened his kingdom internally by conciliating the Catholics, whom his Arian predecessors had oppressed. When the king of the Suevi declared for Catholic Christianity about 560, Athanagild and the Visigothic nobility found themselves isolated in their Arianism. His court at the city he founded, Toledo, was famed for its splendor.<br />
 <br />
Athanagild was the father of the queens Brunhilda and the tragically murdered Galswintha, who married the Frankish brother-kings Sigebert of Austrasia and Chilperic, king of the Neustrian Franks, who set aside his first wife in favor of Galswintha, then had her strangled. Athanagild died peacefully in his bed, a fact his chronicler did not overlook, and was succeeded by his brothers Liuva I and the powerful restorer of Visigothic unity, Leovigild, last of the Arian Visigoths.<br />

Sigebert I (535-575) was a Frankish King, one of the sons of Clotaire Iand Ingund. He successfully pursued a civil war against his half brother,Chilperic I.<br />
 <br />
When Clotaire I died in 561, his kingdom was divided, in accordance with Frankish custom, among his four sons; Sigebert became king of the northeastern portion, known as Austrasia, to which he added further territory on the death of his brother, Charibert, in 567 or 568. Incursions by the Avars, a fierce nomadic tribe related to the Huns, caused him to move his capital from Reims to Metz. He repelled their attacks twice, in 562 and c. 568.<br />
 <br />
About 567 he married Brunhilda, daughter of the Visigothic king Athanagild, whose other daughter, Galswintha, married Chilperic I. When Chilperic had Galswintha murdered in order to marry Fredegund, Sigebert sought revenge. The two brothers had already fought each other, but their hostility now elevated into a long and bitter war that was continued by the descendants of both.<br />
 <br />
Sigebert defeated Chilperic and conquered most of his kingdom. Chilperic then hid in Tournai. But at Sigebert's moment of triumph, when he had just been declared king by Chilperic's subjects at Vitry, he was struck down by two assassins working for Fredegund.<br />

Humbert III (b. 1135 - d. 1189), surnamed the Blessed, was Count of Savoy from 1148 to 1189. According to Cope, "Humbert III, who reigned from 1149 to 1189...was a man of irresolute spirit who was disconsolate at being born a prince and preferred the seclusion of a monestery. He only renounced his chosen state of celibacy so as to give his land an heir."<br />
 <br />
His first wife died young; his second marriage ended in divorce. Humbert gave up and became a Carthusian monk. However, the nobles and common people of Savoy begged him to marry yet again, which he reluctantly did. This third wife gave him two more daughters, and Humbert attempted to return to the monastic life yet again. Finally he was prevailed upon to marry for a fourth time, and this wife, Beatrice, produced the son who would ultimately succeed him.<br />
 <br />
He married four times:<br />
   1. Faidiva (Italian) daughter of Alphonse I of Toulouse<br />
   2. Gertrude of Flanders, whom he divorced and confined. She was freed thanks to Robert, bishop of Cambrai and returned to the court of her brother, Philip of Flanders<br />
   3. Clemenza of Zähringen (married 1164), daughter of Conrad I of Zähringen. They had 2 daughters:<br />
       1. Sofia, (1165-1202), married Azzo IV of Este<br />
       2. Alicia, (1166-1178), betrothed to John of England<br />

Blanche of Castile (1188-1252), wife of Louis VIII of France, thirddaughter of Alfonso VIII, king of Castile, and of Eleanor of England,daughter of Henry II, was born at Palencia.<br />
 <br />
In consequence of a treaty between Philip Augustus and John of England, she was betrothed to the former's son, Louis, and was brought to France, in the spring of 1200, by John's mother Eleanor. On May 22, 1200 the treaty was finally signed, John ceding with his niece the fiefs of Issoudun and Gracay, together with those that André de Chavigny, lord of Châteauroux, held in Berry, of the English crown. The marriage was celebrated the next day, at Portmort on the right bank of the Seine, in John's domains, as those of Philip lay under an interdict.<br />
 <br />
Blanche first displayed her great qualities in 1216, when Louis, who on the death of John claimed the English crown in her right, invaded England, only to find a united nation against him. Philip Augustus refused to help his son, and Blanche was his sole support. The queen established herself at Calais and organized two fleets, one of which was commanded by Eustace the Monk, and an army under Robert of Courtenay; but all her resolution and energy were in vain. Although it would seem that her masterful temper exercised a sensible influence upon her husband's gentler character, her role during his reign (1223-1226) is not well known. Upon his death he left Blanche regent and guardian of his children. Of her twelve or thirteen children, six had died, and Louis, the heir--afterwards the sainted Louis IX--was but twelve years old. The situation was critical, for the hard-won domains of the house of Capet seemed likely to fall to pieces during a minority. Blanche had to bear the whole burden of affairs alone, to break up a league of the barons (1226), and to repel the attack of the king of England (1230). But her energy and firmness overcame all dangers. There was an end to the calumnies circulated against her, based on the poetical homage rendered her by Theobald IV of Champagne, and the prolonged stay in Paris of the papal legate, Romano Bonaventura, cardinal of Sant' Angelo.<br />
 <br />
The nobles were awed by her warlike preparations or won over by adroit diplomacy, and their league was broken up. St Louis owed his realm to his mother, but he himself always remained somewhat under the spell of her imperious personality. After he came of age (1236) her influence upon him may still be traced. In 1248 she again became regent, during Louis IX's absence on the crusade, a project which she had strongly opposed. In the disasters which followed she maintained peace, while draining the land of men and money to aid her son in the East. At last her strength failed her. She fell ill at Melun in November 1252, and was taken to Paris, but lived only a few days. She was buried at Maubuisson.<br />

Philip II (French: Philippe II), called Philip Augustus (French: Philippe Auguste) (August 21, 1165 - July 14, 1223), was King of France from 1180 to 1223.<br />
 <br />
A member of the Capetian dynasty, Philip Augustus was born August 21, 1165 at Gonesse, Val-d'Oise, France, the son of Louis VII of France and his third wife, Adèle of Champagne.<br />
 <br />
Philip was a younger half-brother of Marie de Champagne, Alix of France, Marguerite of France and Alys, Countess of the Vexin. He was an older brother of Agnes of France.<br />
 <br />
In declining health, his father had him crowned at Reims in 1179. He was married on April 28, 1180 to Isabelle of Hainaut. His father and co-ruler died on September 18, 1180. His eldest son Louis (later King Louis VIII), was born on September 5, 1187.<br />
 <br />
As king, he would become one of the most successful in consolidating France into one royal domain. He seized the territories of Maine, Touraine, Anjou, Brittany, and all of Normandy from King John of England. His decisive victory at the Battle of Bouvines over King John and a coalition of forces that included Otto IV of Germany ended the immediate threat of challenges to this expansion (1214) and left Philip Augustus as the most powerful monarch in all of Europe.<br />
 <br />
He reorganized the government, bringing to the country a financial stability which permitted a sharp increase in prosperity. His reign was popular with ordinary people when he checked the power the nobles and passed some of it on to the growing middle class his reign had created.<br />
 <br />
He went on the Third Crusade with Richard the Lionhearted and the Holy Roman Emperor, Frederick I Barbarossa (1189-1192). His army left Vézelay on July 1, 1190. At first the French and English crusaders traveled together, but the armies split at Lyons, as King Richard decided to go by sea, and Philip Augustus took the overland route through the Alps to Genoa. The French and English armies were reunited in Messina, where they wintered together. On March 1, 1190 the French set sail for the Holy Land, where they launched several assaults on Acre before King Richard arrived (see Siege of Acre). By the time Acre surrendered on July 12, Philip Augustus was terribly ill with dysentery and had little more interest in further crusading. He decided to return to France, a decision that displeased King Richard, who said, "It is a shame and a disgrace on my lord if he goes away without having finished the business that brought him hither. But still, if he finds himself in bad health, or is afraid lest he should die here, his will be done." So on July 31, 1191 the French army remained in Outremer under the command of Hugues III, duke of Burgundy. King Philip and his cousin Peter de Courtenay, count of Nevers, made their way to Genoa, and from there returned to France.<br />
 <br />
Philip Augustus decided to marry again, and so August 15, 1193 he married Ingeborg of Denmark (1175-1236), the daughter of King Valdemar I of Denmark. She was renamed Isambour, and Stephan of Dornik described her as "very kind, young of age but old of wisdom." For some unknown reason, Philip Augustus was repulsed by her, and he refused to have her be crowned queen. Ingeborg protested this treatment, so he shut her up in a convent. He asked the pope for an annulment, on the grounds of non-consummation. Philip Augustus had not counted on Ingeborg, however; she insisted that the marriage had been consummated, and she was his wife and the rightful queen of France. In the meantime Philip Augustus had married for a third time on May 7, 1196 to Princess Agnès of Méranie (c.1180 - July 29, 1201). Their children were:<br />
   1. Marie (1198 - October 15, 1224)<br />
   2. Philippe Hurepel (1200 - 1234)<br />
 <br />
Pope Innocent III declared that this new marriage was null and void, since Philip Augustus was still wed to Ingeborg. He ordered Philip to part from Agnès and when he did not, the pope placed France under an interdict in 1199. This continued until September 7, 1200. Due to pressure from the pope and from Ingeborg's brother, King Valdemar II of Denmark, Philip Augustus finally took Ingeborg back as his queen in 1213.<br />
 <br />
Philip Augustus would play a significant role in one of the greatest centuries of innovation in construction and in education. With Paris as his capital, he had the main thoroughfares paved, built a central market, Les Halles, continued the construction begun in 1163 of the Gothic Notre-Dame de Paris Cathedral, constructed the Louvre as a fortress and gave a charter to the University of Paris (the Sorbonne) in 1200. Under his guidance, Paris became the first city of teachers the medieval world had known.<br />
 <br />
Philip Augustus died July 14, 1223 at Mantes and was interred in Saint Denis Basilica. He was succeeded by his son by Isabelle of Hainaut, Louis VIII.<br />

 <br />
Louis VII the Younger (French: Louis VII le Jeune) (1120 - September 18, 1180) was King of France from 1137 to 1180.<br />
 <br />
A member of the Capetian Dynasty, Louis VII was born in 1120, the second son of Louis the Fat and Adélaide of Maurienne (c. 1100 - 1154). Construction began on Notre-Dame de Paris in Paris during his reign.<br />
 <br />
As a younger son, Louis had been raised to follow the ecclesiastical path. He unexpectedly became the heir to the throne of France after the accidental death of his older brother, Philip, in 1131. A well-learned and exceptionally devout man, Louis was better suited for life as a priest than that of a monarch.<br />
 <br />
In the same year he was crowned king of France, Louis VII was married on July 22, 1137 to Eleanor of Aquitaine (1122 - March 31, 1204), heiress of William X of Aquitaine. The pairing of the monkish Louis and the high-spirited Eleanor was doomed to failure; she once reportedly declared that she had thought to marry a king, only to find she'd married a monk. Their daughters were:<br />
    * Marie of Champagne (1145 - March 11, 1198), married Henry I of Champagne<br />
    * Alix of France (1151 - 1197/1198), married Theobald V of Blois<br />
 <br />
n the first part of Louis VII's reign he was vigorous and jealous of his prerogatives, but after his crusade his piety limited his ability to become an effective statesman. His accession was marked by no disturbances, save the uprisings of the burgesses of Orléans and of Poitiers, who wished to organize communes. But soon he came into violent conflict with Pope Innocent II. The archbishopric of Bourges became vacant, and the king supported as candidate the chancellor Cadurc, against the pope's nominee Pierre de la Chatre, swearing upon relics that so long as he lived Pierre should never enter Bourges. This brought the interdict upon the king's lands.<br />
 <br />
Louis became involved in a war with Theobald II of Champagne, by permitting Raoul I of Vermandois and seneschal of France, to repudiate his wife, Theobald's niece, and to marry Petronilla of Aquitaine, sister of the queen of France. Champagne also sided with the pope in the dispute over Bourges. The war lasted two years (1142-44) and ended with the occupation of Champagne by the royal army. Louis was personally involved in the assault and burning of the town of Vitry. More than a thousand people who had sought refuge in the church, died in the flames. Overcome with guilt, Louis declared on Christmas Day 1145 at Bourges his intention of going on a crusade. Bernard of Clairvaux assured its popularity by his preaching at Vezelay (Easter 1146).<br />
 <br />
Meanwhile in 1144, Geoffrey the Handsome, count of Anjou, completed his conquest of Normandy, threatening the royal domains. Louis VII by a clever manoeuvre threw his army on the Norman frontier and gained Gisors, one of the keys of Normandy.<br />
 <br />
In June 1147 Louis and his queen, Eleanor, set out from Metz, Lorraine, on the overland route to Syria. Just beyond Laodicea the French army was ambushed by Turks. The French were bombarded by arrows and heavy stones, the Turks swarmed down from the mountains and the massacre began. The historian Odo of Deuil reported:<br />
 <br />
    "During the fighting the king [Louis] lost his small and famous royal guard, but he remained in good heart and nimbly and courageously scaled the side of the mountain by gripping the tree roots ... The enemy climbed after him, hoping to capture him, and the enemy in the distance continued to fire arrows at him. But God willed that his cuirass should protect him from the arrows, and to prevent himself from being captured he defended the crag with his bloody sword, cutting off many heads and hands."<br />
 <br />
Louis and his army finally reached the Holy Land in 1148. His queen Eleanor supported her uncle, Raymond of Antioch, and prevailed upon Louis to help Antioch against Aleppo. But Louis' interest lay in Jerusalem, and so he slipped out of Antioch in secret. He united with Conrad III of Germany and King Baldwin III of Jerusalem to lay seige to Damascus; this ended in disaster and the project was abandoned. Louis decided to leave the Holy Land, despite the protests of Eleanor, who still wanted to help her doomed uncle Raymond of Antioch. Louis and the French army returned to France in 1149.<br />
 <br />
The expedition came to a great cost to the royal treasury and military. It also precipitated a conflict with Eleanor, leading to the annulment of their marriage at the council of Beaugency (March 1152). The pretext of kinship was the basis for annulment. Its reasons had more to do with quarrels between Louis and Eleanor, her scandalous behavior during the Crusades, and the decreasing odds that their marriage would produce a male heir to the throne of France. Eleanor subsequently married Henry, Count of Anjou in the following May, which brought him the duchy of Aquitaine. Louis VII led an ineffective war against Henry for having married without the authorization of his suzerain; but in August 1154 gave up his rights over Aquitaine, and contented himself with an indemnity.<br />
 <br />
In 1154 Louis married Constance, daughter of Alfonso VII, king of Castile. She, too, failed to give him a son and heir, bearing two more daughters:<br />
   1. Marguerite of France(1158-1197), married (1) Henry the Young King; (2) King Bela III of Hungary<br />
   2. Alys, Countess of the Vexin (October 4, 1160), engaged to Richard I of England; she married William III Talvas, Count of Ponthieu<br />
 <br />
As part of a peace process with Henry II of England, Louis imprudently pledged his daughter, Marguerite, in the treaty of Gisors (1158) to Henry, Henry's eldest son, promising as a dowry the Norman Vexin and Gisors.<br />
 <br />
Constance died in childbirth on the 4th of October 1160, and five weeks later Louis VII married Adèle of Champagne. Henry II, to counterbalance the advantage this would give the king of France, had the marriage of their children celebrated at once. Louis VII understood the danger of the growing Angevin power, however, through indecision and lack of fiscal and military resources compared to Henry's, Louis failed to oppose Angevin hegemony effectively. One of the few military successes of Louis, in 1159, was his expedition in the south to aid Raymond V, Count of Toulouse who had been attacked by Henry II. At the same time the emperor Frederick I in the east was making good the imperial claims on Arles. When the schism broke out, Louis took the part of the pope Alexander III, the enemy of Frederick, and after two comical failures of Frederick to meet Louis VII at Saint Jean de Losne (on the 29th of August and the 22nd of September 1162), Louis definitely gave himself up to the cause of Alexander, who lived at Sens from 1163 to 1165. Alexander gave the king, in return for his loyal support, the golden rose.<br />
 <br />
Finally, in 1165 Adèle gave birth to them much longed-for son, along with a daughter a few years later. Louis and Adèle's children were:<br />
   1. Philip II Augustus (August 22, 1165-1223)<br />
   2. Agnes of France (1171-1240), who married (1) Alexius II Comnenus; (2) Andronicus I Comnenus; (3) Theodosius Branas<br />
 <br />
Louis VII received Thomas Becket and tried to reconcile him with King Henry II. Louis sided with Thomas Becket as a way to weaken Henry politically. He also supported Henry's rebellious sons, but the rivalry between Henry's sons and Louis' own indecisiveness contributed to the break up of the coalition (1173-1174). Finally in 1177 the pope intervened to bring the two kings to terms at Vitry.<br />
 <br />
His reign was a difficult and unfortunate one, from the point of view of royal territory and military power. Yet the royal authority made progress in the parts of France distant from the royal domains. More direct and more frequent connection was made with distant vassals, a result largely due to the alliance of the clergy with the crown. Louis thus reaped the reward for services rendered the church during the least successful portion of his reign. His greater accomplishments lie in the development of agriculture, population, commerce, the building of stone fortresses, as well as an intellectual renaissance. Considering the significant disparity of political leverage and financial resources between Louis and his Angevin rival, not to mention Henry's superior military skills, Louis should be credited with preserving the Capetian dynasty.<br />
 <br />
He was to be succeeded by his son by Adèle, Philip II Augustus and had him crowned at Reims in 1179. However, already stricken with paralysis, King Louis himself was not able to be present at the ceremony.<br />
 <br />
Louis VII died on September 18, 1180 at the Abbey at Saint-Pont, Allier and is interred in Saint Denis Basilica.<br />

Isabelle of Hainaut (1170 - 1190) was queen consort of France.<br />
 <br />
Isabelle was born in Lille, the daughter of Baldwin V, Count of Hainaut and Countess Margaret I of Flanders. She married King Philip II of France in 1180 and brought as her dowry the county of Artois.<br />
 <br />
Isabella was crowned consort of France at Saint Denis on May 28, 1180. As Baldwin V claimed to be a descendant of Charlemagne, the chroniclers of the time saw in this marriage a union of the Carolingian and Capetian dynasties. Though she received extravagant praise from certain annalists, she failed to win the affections of Philip, who, in 1184, waging war against Flanders, was angered at seeing Baldwin support his enemies, and called a council at Sens for the purpose of repudiating her. Robert, the king's uncle, successfully interposed.<br />
 <br />
Isabella died in childbirth in 1190, and was buried in the cathedral of Notre Dame in Paris. Her son became Louis VIII of France.<br />

Lawrence S. Hagen was the 5th born child to Carl and Nettie Asper Hagenon their Union County farm near Alcester, S.D. on Sept. 8, 1912. He diedMarch 14, 2008 at Pioneer Memorial Nursing Home in Viborg, SD at the ageof 95 years, 6 months and 6 days.<br />
He attended Cole School and attended Augustana Normal in Canton. On July 4th, 1930 he married Opal A. Thormodsgard at her family farm in Alcester. Lawrence worked as a hired man for his Uncle Charles Asper until he was able to acquire a team of horses which was a requirement to work on the construction of S.D. Highway 46. After one year of that, he began farming with his brother Arlo, for two years after which he again worked for Aspers and went back to Hwy. 46. Lawrence and his brother-in-law Palmer Thormodsgard started farming at a farm by Moe Church, "The Rice Place" where many memories were made, a house fire, a drowning among many other things. Carl gave Lawrence 2 cows to start his dairy herd and a new Farmall tractor was purchased by Palmer and Lawrence. Sleeping in corn cribs until a new house was built was a challenge with three small children, hired men and sometimes extra guests. One more move to another farm by Hudson was made and then on to the farm by Beresford which was purchased in 1951.<br />
Farming wasn't easy so often Lawrence worked for his brother-in-law building grain elevators in Iowa, Minnesota and S.D. As he wasn't afraid of heights he often did the high jobs and put in very long, hard days away from home doing what many men would not.<br />
After his retirement he spent many hours working in his yard and garden. He worked for the soil conservation office several years planting trees on many of the farms in Lincoln County. In 1978 Lawrence and Opal retired to Beresford. Lawrence did yardwork, odd jobs and enjoyed helping at his daughters' farms whenever he could. He became active in the Beresford Senior Center and loved to play pool, cards and chicken foot dominoes. He regularly attended prayer breakfast at Emmanuel Church in Beresford.<br />
Among Lawrence's many accomplishments he was very proud to have been a spelling champion in 1927 which earned him a train ride to Huron, a state champion baseball player with the 1927 Alcester champions, enjoyed skiing with the grandchildren and golfing when he had a chance. He served on the Pleasant Hill school board, held several offices in Lands church, was the lawn attendant for the Moe Parish Park, church and cemetery which he took a lot of pride in for many years. Lawrence was well known for attending auction sales and usually brought home many treasures and a few useless items which entertained many people.<br />
Lawrence loved to travel and was very good at navigating even in large cities. Visiting his children allowed him to travel many places with friends and relatives usually accompanying him. A highlight of his life was a trip to Norway which allowed him to visit his ancestor's homes and cemeteries which started an obsession with going to cemeteries to learn more about his past. Photos and videotaping became another pastime for Lawrence and he organized over 300 video tapes in later years and enjoyed showing them. Music was a love of his, from Lawrence Welk to Southern gospel.<br />
The family memories are many but one is July 4th with family and friends to celebrate Lawrence and Opals anniversary for 6o years - never missed one get together! A very special granddaughter shared Lawrence's birthday for 45 years - Melanie. Babies and grandchildren were the love of his life. Politics, religion and sales were great topics for conversation and controversy throughout the years. He gave everyone a legacy of cherished memories, a combination of laughter and tears throughout the 95 and years of his life.<br />
He was preceded in death by his parents, wife, son Wayne (Bud), daughter Virginia Hoben, 2 sons-in-law, Lloyd Knudson and Harry Hoben, a grandchild, a great grandchild, a step-great grandchild, 4 brothers, Arlo, Noble, Norman, and Olaf Palmer, and 3 sisters, Lillian Olson, Elsa Saugstad, and Opal Gullickson.<br />

Toda Aznárez, also Teuda de Larraun or Tota (c. 885-aft. 970), was thequeen-consort of Pamplona through her marriage to Sancho I, who reigned905-925, and was regent of Pamplona, 931-934.<br />
She was the daughter of Aznar Sánchez, lord of Larraun, paternal grandson of king Garćıa Íñiguez of Pamplona, while her mother Onneca Fortúnez was a daughter of king Fortún Garcés. Thus, Toda's children were also descendants of the Arista dynasty of Navarrese monarchs. She was sister of Sancha Aznárez, wife of king Jimeno Garcés, her husband's brother and successor, while Toda and Sancha were also aunts of Caliph Abd-ar-Rahman III, through their mother's first marriage to ʻAbdullah ibn Muhammad.<br />
With the death of her brother-in-law Jimeno in 931, she became regent and guardian for her young son, Garćıa Sánchez I. In 934 Toda signed a treaty pledging allegiance to her nephew Abd-ar-Rahman III, and released hostages of the Banu Di n-Nun clan, the caliph confirming the rule of her son Garćıa (this has sometimes been interpreted as an act of the Caliph to liberate Garćıa from his mother's direct control). This led to the rebellion in Falces by a count Fortún Garcés, an "irascible man who hated Muslims", the uprising being suppressed with Cordoban arms. Toda violated her treaty in 937, forcing a punitive campaign. She had been an energetic diplomat, arranging political marriages for her daughters among the competing royalty and nobility of Christian Iberia.<br />
The Codex of Roda gives Sancho and Toda six children:<br />
    * Oneca (d. 931), married Alfonso IV the Monk of León in 926<br />
    * Sancha, married firstly Ordoño II of León, secondly Count Alvaro Herraméliz of Álava, and thirdly Fernán González, Count of Castile<br />
    * Urraca, married Ramiro II of León<br />
    * Velasquita (or Belasquita), married firstly Munio, count of Vizcaya, secondly Galindo, son of Bernard count of Ribagorza, and thirdly Fortún Gaĺındez, duke of Nájera.<br />
    * Orbita<br />
    * Garćıa, king of Pamplona<br />

Fernán González (died 970) was the first independent count of Castile,son of Gonzalo Fernández de Burgos, who had been named count of Arlanzaand the Duero around the year 900, and by tradition a descendant ofsemi-legendary judge Nuño Rasura. His mother Muniadona Raḿırez was sowell remembered that the later Counts of Castile would sometimes berecorded by Iberian Muslim scholars as Ibn Mama Duna (descendant ofMuniadona).<br />
Fernán González was a colourful character of legendary status in Iberia, and founder of the dynasty that would rule a semi-autonomous Castile, laying the foundations for its status as an independent kingdom. In the year 930, Ferdinand's name appears with the title of count inside the administrative organization of eastern the Kingdom of León.<br />
He grew up in the castle of Lara and inherited his father's title after the capture and death of his uncle, Nuño Fernández.<br />
In 931, Fernán gathered under his control a strong military force composed of troops from the counties of Burgos, Asturias, Santillana, Lantaron, Álava, Castile, and Lara. His military prowess came to prominence in the Battle of Simancas in 939 and then at Sepulveda, where he wrested the region from the Moors and repopulated it. As his power increased, so did his independence from León. During this period he married Sancha, the sister of the king of Navarre, Garćıa Sánchez I. Sancha was a daughter of Sancho I of Pamplona, and Toda of Navarre.<br />
After having fought with Ramiro II of León against the Arabs, and after the Battle of Simancas and the retreat of the Muslims, Fernán was dissatisfied because the king of León distributed his troops in the frontier towns and he rose in rebellion against him. He was, however, defeated and made prisoner in 944, which lasted for 3 years until he became reconciled with his sovereign, giving his daughter Urraca in marriage to the king's son, Ordoño, who afterwards became King Ordoño III.<br />
Notwithstanding this alliance, Fernán continued to foment trouble and discord in León. He later aided Sancho I against his brother Ordoño III, and then Ordoño IV, son of Alfonso IV, against Sancho.<br />
Upon the death of Ramiro II of Leon in 951, the kingdom of León experienced a dynastic crisis that Fernán played out to his advantage.<br />
Initially Fernán supported the demands of Sancho I against his brother Ordoño III, but when Sancho failed, Fernán was forced to recognize Ordoño as king. Ordoño III's early death allowed Fernán to recover his maneuvering capacity, although he abandoned his old ally Sancho, instead supporting his rival Ordoño IV. Defeated in 960 through Navarrese intervention, he was captured by King Garćıa of Navarre, but he recovered his freedom after making various territorial concessions. With the kingdom of León weakened and in disorder, Fernán slowly solidified his position as legitimate independent count of Castile.<br />
After his death the county was left to his son Garćıa Fernández. His remains were buried in the monastery of San Pedro of Arlanza.<br />
His life and feats are recorded in an anonymous poem, The Poem of Fernán González, written between 1250 and 1271 and conserved as an incomplete copy from the fifteenth century.<br />
By Sancha of Navarre, he had the following children:<br />
    * Gonzalo, who married Fronilde Gómez, suggested to have been granddaughter of count Diego Rodŕıguez Porcelos<br />
    * Sancho, named in a charter of his paternal grandmother<br />
    * Munio<br />
    * Garćıa, his eventual successor<br />
    * Urraca, twice queen of León and then of Navarre<br />
    * Muniadona, wife of Gómez D́ıaz, count of Saldaña, of the powerful Beni Gómez clan<br />

From Wikipedia<br />
 <br />
Leonora of Aquitaine (October 13, 1162 - October 31, 1214), was born as Princess Eleanor of England and became Leonora, Queen of Castile.<br />
 <br />
She was born in Domfront Castle, Normandy. She was the seventh child and second daughter of King Henry II of England and his wife Queen Eleanor of Aquitaine. Her godfather was the chronicler Robert of Torigny, who had a special interest in her and recorded her life as best he could.<br />
 <br />
Eleanor was a younger maternal half-sister of Marie de Champagne and Alix of France. She was a younger sister of William, Count of Poitiers, Henry the Young King, Matilda of England, Richard I of England and Geoffrey II, Duke of Brittany. She was also an older sister of Joan Plantagenet and John of England.<br />
 <br />
When she was eight years old, in 1170, she was married to King Alfonso VIII of Castile. The marriage was arranged to secure the Pyrennean border, with Gascony offered as her dowry.<br />
 <br />
They had 12 children:<br />
   1. Berenguela, Queen of Castile (1180-1244)<br />
   2. Sancho of Castile (1181-1181)<br />
   3. Sancha of Castile (1182-1184?)<br />
   4. Mafalda of Castile (1183?-1204)<br />
   5. Urraca of Castile (1186-1220), married King Alfonso II of Portugal<br />
   6. Blanca of Castile (1188-1252), married King Louis VIII of France<br />
   7. Fernando of Castile (1189-1211)<br />
   8. Constance of Castile (1196?-late 1190's)<br />
   9. Leonor of Castile (1200-1244), married King James I of Aragon<br />
  10. Constanza, nun at Las Huelgas (1203?-1243)<br />
  11. Henry I, King of Castile (1204-1217).<br />
 <br />
Of all Eleanor of Aquitaine's daughters, her namesake Eleanor (who was called Leonor by her Spanish subjects) best inherited her mother's political influence. She reigned alongside her husband, who specified in his will that she was to rule alongside their son in the event of his death. It was she who persuaded him to marry their daughter Berenguela to the king of Leon in the interest of peace.<br />
 <br />
When Alfonso died, his queen was reportedly so devastated with grief that she was unable to preside over the burial. Their daughter Berenguela instead performed these honors. Leonora then took sick and died only twenty-eight days after her husband, and was buried at Abbey de las Huelgas, in Burgos.<br />

Sancho III of Castile (1134 - August 30, 1158), called el Deseado (TheDesired), was King of Castile for one year, from 1157 to 1158.<br />
 <br />
He was the eldest son of King Alfonso VII of Castile and Berenguela of Barcelona. His father's will partitioned the kingdom between his two sons: Sancho inherited Castile, and Fernando inherited Leon. The two brothers had just signed a treaty before Sancho's sudden death in the summer of 1158. He left an only son and heir, Alfonso VIII of Castile, by his wife Blanca of Navarre.<br />

Childebert II (570-595), king of Austrasia, was a son of Sigebert I.<br />
 <br />
When his father was assassinated in 575, Childebert was taken from Paris by Gundobald, one of his faithful lords, to Metz, where he was recognized as sovereign. He was then only five years old, and during his long minority the power was disputed between his mother Brunhilda and the nobles.<br />
 <br />
Chilperic, king at Paris, and King Gontran of Burgundy, sought alliance with Childebert, who was adopted by both in turn. But after the assassination of Chilperic in 584, and the dangers occasioned to the Frankish monarchy by the expedition of Gundobald in 585, Childebert threw himself unreservedly into the arms of Gontran.<br />
 <br />
By the pact of Andelot in 587 Childebert was recognized as Gontran?s heir, and with his uncle's help he quelled the revolts of the nobles and succeeded in seizing the castle of Woëwre. Many attempts were made on his life by Fredegond, who was anxious to secure Gontran's inheritance for her son Clotaire II.<br />
 <br />
On the death of Gontran in 592 Childebert annexed the kingdom of Burgundy, and even contemplated seizing Clotaire's estates and becoming sole king of the Franks. He died, however, in 595. Childebert II had had relations with the Byzantine Empire, and fought in 585 in the name of the emperor Maurice against the Lombards in Italy.<br />

Alfonso VIII (November 11, 1155 - October 5, 1214), king of Castile and grandson of Alfonso VII, is a great name in Spanish history, for he led the coalition of Christian princes and foreign crusaders who broke the power of the Almohades at the battle of the Navas de Tolosa in 1212.<br />
 <br />
His personal history is that of many medieval kings. He succeeded to the throne, in infancy, on the death of his father, Sancho. Though proclaimed king, he was regarded as a mere name by the unruly nobles to whom a minority was convenient. Also his mother was dead, thus he did not have closer relatives than his uncle Ferdinand, king of Leon, who wanted power in Castile. The devotion of a squire of his household, who carried him on the pommel of his saddle to the stronghold of San Esteban de Gormaz, saved him from falling into the hands of the contending factions of Castro and Lara, or of his uncle Ferdinand of León, who claimed the regency.<br />
 <br />
The loyalty of the town of Ávila protected his youth. He was barely fifteen when he came forth to do a man's work by restoring his kingdom to order. It was only by a surprise that he recovered his capital Toledo from the hands of the Laras. His marriage with Eleanor of England (Sp: Leonora), daughter of Henry II of England and Eleanor of Aquitaine (Aquitaine having old ties with Castile), brought him under the influence of the greatest governing intellect of his time. Alfonso VIII was the founder of the first Spanish university, the studium generale of Palencia, which, however, did not survive him.<br />
 <br />
During his reign, Castile annexed the province of Logroño.<br />
 <br />
In 1176, Alfonso married Leonora of England and Aquitaine. They had 12 children:<br />
    * Berenguela, or Berenguaria, Queen of Castile (1180-1246), married to Conrad of Hohenstaufen, Duke of Swabia, and then to Alfonso IX, King of León; succeeded her brother, Henry I<br />
    * Sancho, prince of Castile (1181)<br />
    * Sancha, princess of Castile (1182-1184)<br />
    * Urraca, princess of Castile (1186-1220), married to Alfonso II of Portugal<br />
    * Blanche, a.k.a Blanche of Castile, princess of Castile (1188-1252), married to Louis VIII of France<br />
    * Ferdinand, prince of Castile (1189-1211)<br />
    * Mafalda, princess of Castile (1191-1204)<br />
    * Henry, prince of Castile (1192 - 1190s)<br />
    * Constance or Constanza, princess of Castile (1196 - late 1190s)<br />
    * Eleonor or Eleanor, princess of Castile (1202-1244), married to James I of Aragon<br />
    * Henry I of Castile (1204-1217) succeeded his father.<br />
    * Constance or Constanza, princess of Castile (?-1243), abbess of Las Huelgas<br />

Henry I of Brabant (also called Henri I de Brabant and Hendrik I vanBrabant) was born in 1165 and died in the German city of Köln onSeptember 5, 1235. He was Duke of Brabant (1190-1235) and Duke ofLorraine. He was the son of Godfrey III duke of Lorraine and count ofBrabant and Margaret of Limburg.<br />
 <br />
He married Maud of Boulogne and Alsace (also called Maud of Flanders) in 1179.<br />
 <br />
Henri II de Brabant was born from his first marriage.<br />
 <br />
His second marriage was at April 22, 1213 in Soissons to Marie, princess of France, daughter of King Philip II of France.<br />
 <br />
Under Hendrik I, there was a town policy and town planning. Hendrik's attention went out to those regions that lent themselves for extension of his sovereignty and in some locations he used the creation of a new town as an instrument in the political organisation of the area. Among the towns to which the Duke gave city rights and trade privileges was 's-Hertogenbosch.<br />
 <br />

Blanca of Navarre, (aft. 1133, Pamplona - August 12, 1156), was CrownPrincess of Castile 1151-1156, but never the full queen, as she diedbefore her father-in-law. She was the daughter of king Garcia VI ofNavarre "The Restorer" and Marguerite de L'Aigle de Rotrou, from France.Her brother was Sancho VI "The Wise" King of Navarre who reigned 1150-94.<br />
 <br />
Blanca was married to the future Sancho III of Castile el Deseado (the Beloved) on January 30, 1151 in Catahorra, Logrono, but died before her father-in-law, and her widowed husband later reigned only briefly as king of Castile 1157-58. She had several children who did not survive and are buried in the church of San Pedro in Soria. On November 11, 1155 she gave birth to the future king Alfonso. There appears to be no record of her activities thereafter, except for her death on August 12, 1156. While it had been suggested that she might have died from the complications of a new pregnancy, Valdez maintains that she died from sequelae of the birth of her son. That her death was caused by a pregnancy is recorded in an epitaph.<br />
 <br />
Sancho donated money to the monastery of Santa Maria la Real in Najera where she is buried. The sarcophagus of the queen is regarded as a primary example of the ability to express artistically human emotions in the 12th century.<br />

 <br />
Attila the Hun (Old Norse: Atle, Atli; German: Etzel; c. 406-453) was the last and most powerful king of the European Huns. He reigned over what was then Europe's largest empire, from 434 until his death. His empire stretched from Central Europe to the Black Sea and from the Danube River to the Baltic. During his rule he was among the direst enemies of the Eastern and Western Roman Empires: he invaded the Balkans twice and encircled Constantinople in the second invasion. He marched through France as far as Orleans before being turned back at Chalons; and he drove the western emperor Valentinian III from his capital at Ravenna in 452.<br />
 <br />
Though his empire died with him, and he left no remarkable legacy, he has become a legendary figure in the history of Europe. In much of Western Europe, he is remembered as the epitome of cruelty and rapacity. Some histories lionise him as a great and noble king, and he plays major roles in three Norse sagas.<br />
 <br />
The European Huns seem to have been a western extension of the Xiongnu (Xiongnú), a group of proto-Mongolian or proto-Turkic nomad tribes from north-eastern China and Central Asia. These people achieved military superiority over their rivals (most of them highly cultured and civilized) by their splendid state of readiness for combat, amazing mobility, and weapons like the Hun bow.<br />
 <br />
Attila was born around 406. Nothing is known about his childhood; the supposition that at a young age he was already a capable leader and a capable warrior is reasonable but unknowable.<br />
 <br />
By 432, the Huns were united under Rua. In 434 Rua died, leaving his nephews Attila and Bleda, the sons of his brother Mundzuk, in control over all the united Hun tribes. At the time of their accession, the Huns were bargaining with Theodosius II's envoys over the return of several renegade tribes who had taken refuge within the Byzantine Empire. The following year, Attila and Bleda met with the imperial legation at Margus (present-day Pozarevac) and, all seated on horseback in the Hunnic manner, negotiated a successful treaty: the Romans agreed not only to return the fugitive tribes (who had been a welcome aid against the Vandals), but also to double their previous tribute of 350 Roman pounds (c. 114.5 kg) of gold, open their markets to Hunnish traders, and pay a ransom of eight solidi for each Roman taken prisoner by the Huns. The Huns, satisfied with the treaty, decamped from the empire and departed into the interior of the continent, perhaps to consolidate and strengthen their empire. Theodosius used this opportunity to strengthen the walls of Constantinople, building the city's first sea wall, and to build up his border defenses along the Danube.<br />
 <br />
The Huns remained out of Roman sight for the next five years. During this time, they were conducting an invasion of Persia. However, in Armenia, a Persian counterattack resulted in a defeat for Attila and Bleda, and they ceased their efforts to conquer Persia. In 440, they reappeared on the borders of the empire, attacking the merchants at the market on the north bank of the Danube that had been arranged for by the treaty. Attila and Bleda threatened further war, claiming that the Romans had failed to fulfil their treaty obligations and that the bishop of Margus (not far from modern Belgrade) had crossed the Danube to ransack and desecrate the royal Hun graves on the Danube's north bank. They crossed the Danube and laid waste Illyrian cities and forts on the river, among them, according to Priscus, Viminacium, which was a city of the Moesians in Illyria. Their advance began at Margus, for when the Romans discussed handing over the offending bishop, he slipped away secretly to the barbarians and betrayed the city to them.<br />
 <br />
Theodosius had stripped the river's defenses in response to the Vandal Geiseric's capture of Carthage in 440 and the Sassanid Yazdegerd II's invasion of Armenia in 441. This left Attila and Bleda a clear path through Illyria into the Balkans, which they invaded in 441. The Hunnish army, having sacked Margus and Viminacium, took Sigindunum (modern Belgrade) and Sirmium before halting its operations. A lull followed during 442, when Theodosius recalled his troops from North Africa and ordered a large new issue of coins to finance operations against the Huns. Having made these preparations, he thought it safe to refuse the Hunnish kings' demands.<br />
 <br />
Attila and Bleda responded by renewing their campaign in 443. Striking along the Danube, they overran the military centers of Ratiara and successfully besieged Naissus (modern Nis) with battering rams and rolling towers-military sophistication that was new in the Hun repertory-then pushing along the Nisava they took Serdica (Sofia), Philippopolis (Plovdiv), and Arcadiopolis. They encountered and destroyed the Roman force outside Constantinople and were only halted by their lack of siege equipment capable of breaching the city's massive walls. Theodosius admitted defeat and sent the court official Anatolius to negotiate peace terms, which were harsher than the previous treaty: the Emperor agreed to hand over 6,000 Roman pounds (c. 1963 kg) of gold as punishment for having disobeyed the terms of the treaty during the invasion; the yearly tribute was tripled, rising to 2,100 Roman pounds (c. 687 kg) in gold; and the ransom for each Roman prisoner rose to 12 solidi.<br />
 <br />
Their desires contented for a time, the Hun kings withdrew into the interior of their empire. According to Jordanes (following Priscus), sometime during the peace following the Huns' withdrawal from Byzantium (probably around 445), Bleda died, and Attila took the throne for himself. There is much historical speculation whether Attila murdered his brother, or whether Bleda died for another reason. In any case, Attila was now undisputed lord of the Huns, and again turned towards the eastern Empire.<br />
 <br />
Sole ruler<br />
Constantinople suffered major natural (and man-made) disasters in the years following the Huns' departure: bloody riots between the racing factions of the Hippodrome; plagues in 445 and 446, the second following a famine; and a four-month series of earthquakes which levelled much of the city wall and killed thousands, causing another epidemic. This last struck in 447, just as Attila, having consolidated his power, again rode south into the empire through Moesia. The Roman army, under the Gothic magister militum Arnegisclus, met him on the river Vid and was defeated-though not without inflicting heavy losses. The Huns were left unopposed and rampaged through the Balkans as far as Thermopylae; Constantinople itself was saved by the intervention of the prefect Flavius Constantinus, who organized the citizenry to reconstruct the earthquake-damaged walls (and in some places, to construct a new line of fortification in front of the old). An account of this invasion survives:<br />
 <br />
    The barbarian nation of the Huns, which was in Thrace, became so great that more than a hundred cities were captured and Constantinople almost came into danger and most men fled from it. . . . And there were so many murders and blood-lettings that the dead could not be numbered. Ay, for they took captive the churches and monasteries and slew the monks and maidens in great numbers.<br />
 <br />
        - Callinicus, in his Life of Saint Hypatius<br />
 <br />
Attila demanded, as a condition of peace, that the Romans should continue paying tribute in gold-and evacuate a strip of land stretching three hundred miles east from Sigindunum (Belgrade) and up to a hundred miles south of the Danube. Negotiations continued between Roman and Hun for approximately three years. The historian Priscus was sent as emissary to Attila's encampment in 448, and the fragments of his reports preserved by Jordanes offer the best glimpse of Attila among his numerous wives, his Scythian fool, and his Moorish dwarf, impassive and unadorned amid the splendor of the courtiers:<br />
 <br />
    A luxurious meal, served on silver plate, had been made ready for us and the barbarian guests, but Attila ate nothing but meat on a wooden trencher. In everything else, too, he showed himself temperate; his cup was of wood, while to the guests were given goblets of gold and silver. His dress, too, was quite simple, affecting only to be clean. The sword he carried at his side, the latchets of his Scythian shoes, the bridle of his horse were not adorned, like those of the other Scythians, with gold or gems or anything costly.<br />
 <br />
"The floor of the room was covered with woollen mats for walking on," Priscus noted.<br />
 <br />
During these three years, according to a legend recounted by Jordanes, Attila discovered the "Sword of Mars":<br />
 <br />
    The historian Priscus says it was discovered under the following circumstances: "When a certain shepherd beheld one heifer of his flock limping and could find no cause for this wound, he anxiously followed the trail of blood and at length came to a sword it had unwittingly trampled while nibbling the grass. He dug it up and took it straight to Attila. He rejoiced at this gift and, being ambitious, thought he had been appointed ruler of the whole world, and that through the sword of Mars supremacy in all wars was assured to him.<br />
 <br />
        - Jordanes, The Origin and Deeds of the Goths ch. XXXV (e-text)<br />
 <br />
Later scholarship would identify this legend as part of a pattern of sword worship common among the nomads of the Central Asian steppes.<br />
 <br />
Attila in the west<br />
As late as 450, Attila had proclaimed his intent to attack the powerful Visigoth kingdom of Toulouse in alliance with Emperor Valentinian III. He had previously been on good terms with the western Empire and its de facto ruler Flavius Aetius-Aetius had spent a brief exile among the Huns in 433, and the troops Attila provided against the Goths and Bagaudae had helped earn him the largely honorary title of magister militum in the west. The gifts and diplomatic efforts of Geiseric, who opposed and feared the Visigoths, may also have influenced Attila's plans.<br />
 <br />
However Valentinian's sister Honoria, in order to escape her forced betrothal to a senator, had sent the Hunnish king a plea for help-and her ring-in the spring of 450. Though Honoria may not have intended a proposal of marriage, Attila chose to interpret her message as such; he accepted, asking for half of the western Empire as dowry. When Valentinian discovered the plan, only the influence of his mother Galla Placidia convinced him to exile, rather than kill, Honoria; he also wrote to Attila strenuously denying the legitimacy of the supposed marriage proposal. Attila, not convinced, sent an embassy to Ravenna to proclaim that Honoria was innocent, that the proposal had been legitimate, and that he would come to claim what was rightfully his.<br />
 <br />
Meanwhile, Theodosius having died in a riding accident, his successor Marcian cut off the Huns' tribute in late 450; and multiple invasions, by the Huns and by others, had left the Balkans with little to plunder. The king of the Salian Franks had died, and the succession struggle between his two sons drove a rift between Attila and Aetius: Attila supported the elder son, while Aetius supported the younger. J.B. Bury believes that Attila's intent, by the time he marched west, was to extend his kingdom-already the strongest on the continent-across Gaul to the Atlantic shore. By the time Attila had gathered his vassals-Gepids, Ostrogoths, Rugians, Scirians, Heruls, Thuringians, Alans, Burgundians, et al.-and begun his march west, he had declared intent of alliance both with the Visigoths and with the Romans.<br />
 <br />
In 451, his arrival in Belgica with an army said by Jordanes to be half a million strong soon made his intent clear. On April 7 he captured Metz, and Aetius moved to oppose him, gathering troops from among the Franks, the Burgundians, and the Celts. A mission by Avitus, and Attila's continued westward advance, convinced the Visigoth king Theodoric I (Theodorid) to ally with the Romans. The combined armies reached Orleans ahead of Attila, thus checking and turning back the Hunnish advance. Aetius gave chase and caught the Huns at a place usually assumed to be near Châlons-en-Champagne. The two armies clashed in the Battle of Chalons, which ended with a victory for the Gothic-Roman alliance, though Theodoric was killed in the fighting. Attila withdrew beyond the border, and the alliance quickly disbanded.<br />
 <br />
Invasion of Italy and death<br />
Attila returned in 452 to claim his marriage to Honoria anew, invading and ravaging Italy along the way; his army sacked numerous cities and razed Aquileia completely, leaving no trace of it behind. Valentinian fled from Ravenna to Rome; Aetius remained in the field but lacked the strength to offer battle. Attila finally halted at the Po, where he met an embassy including the prefect Trigetius, the consul Aviennus, and Pope Leo I. After the meeting he turned his army back, having claimed neither Honoria's hand nor the territories he desired.<br />

 <br />
Several explanations for his actions have been proffered. The plague and famine which coincided with his invasion may have caused his army to weaken, or the troops that Marcian sent across the Danube may have given him reason to retreat, or perhaps both. Priscus reports that superstitious fear of the fate of Alaric-who died shortly after sacking Rome in 410-gave the Hun pause. Prosper of Aquitaine's pious "fable which has been represented by the pencil of Raphael and the chisel of Algardi" (as Gibbon called it) says that the Pope, aided by Saint Peter and Saint Paul, convinced him to turn away from the city. Various historians (e.g. Isaac Asimov) have supposed that the embassy brought a large amount of gold to the Hunnish leader and persuaded him to abandon his campaign.<br />
 <br />
Whatever his reasons, Attila left Italy and returned to his palace across the Danube. From there he planned to strike at Constantinople again and reclaim the tribute which Marcian had cut off. However, he died in the early months of 453; the conventional account, from Priscus, says that on the night after a feast celebrating his latest marriage (to a Goth named Ildico), he suffered a severe nosebleed and choked to death. His warriors, upon discovering his death, mourned him by cutting off their hair and gashing themselves with their swords so that, says Jordanes, "the greatest of all warriors should be mourned with no feminine lamentations and with no tears, but with the blood of men." He was buried in a triple coffin-of gold, silver, and iron-with the spoils of his conquest, and his funeral party was killed to keep his burial place secret. After his death, he lived on as a legendary figure: the characters of Etzel in the Nibelungenlied and Atli in both the Volsunga saga and the Poetic Edda were both loosely based on his life.<br />
 <br />
(An alternate story of his death, first recorded eighty years after the fact by the Roman chronicler Count Marcellinus, reports: "Attila rex Hunnorum Europae orbator provinciae noctu mulieris manu cultroque confoditur." ("Attila, King of the Huns and ravager of the provinces of Europe, was pierced by the hand and blade of his wife.") The Volsunga saga and the Poetic Edda claim that King Atli died at the hands of his wife Gudrun. Most scholars reject these accounts as no more than romantic fables, preferring instead the version given by Attila's contemporary Priscus.)<br />
 <br />
His sons Ellak (his appointed successor), Dengizik, and Ernakh fought over his legacy and, divided, were defeated and scattered the following year in the Battle of Nedao by the Gepids and Ostrogoths. Attila's empire did not outlast him.<br />

In March, 1652, Stephen Tracy, Francis Cooke and others acquired a large tract of land to the west, later called Dartmouth. These two men had once share each in the venture. For some reason about this time Stephen decided to leave the country. He returned to England before 1654, and signed a power of attorney in London, directing his "loving friend" John Winslow of Plymouth to dispose of his property and divide it among his five children.<br />

Harry Illsley died in his 80th year; on Oct. 16, 1968. He had been apatient in Northfield Hospital for just a few hours, suffering a heartattack after checking into the hospital for tests.<br />
He had driven to a Land O' Lakes meeting two days before. He conferred with Farm Bureau officers about a forthcoming meeting while he was in the hospital.<br />
His death came the morning of the day he was slated to be especially honored at a Land O' Lakes meeting and the day before he was to have been honored as a charter member at the 50th anniversary banquet of the Rice County Farm Bureau Federation. He and his wife, Lois, had planned to leave within a week for their annual winter vacation in Florida.<br />
Illsley was born near Dundas on Aug. 5, 1888, the son of Senator and Mrs. D.W. Illsley. He grew up in the Little Prairie community and spent most of his life there. He had only a sixth grade education, not for lack of interest in school, but for economic necessity. As a very young man, he left his parents' farm to accept employment with the St.Paul Rapid Transit Co. Then for 10 years he fired locomotives for the Soo Line railroad.<br />
But the love of farming proved strong. In 1918 he began buying the Little Prairie farm that had been his wife's childhood home. They were still living there when he died.<br />
Illsley was given the Master Farmer award by The Farmer magazine in 1929. By that time he had dairy cows, hogs and poultry and was raising corn, oats and barley. He had remodeled the farmhouse and improved the farm buildings. He was participating in a soil building practice and he was cooperating with the Farm Management Division of the University Farm in keeping farm accounts. He was president of the Rice County Farm Bureau, president of the Forest Cooperative Creamery, an active member of a livestock shipping association, of a cooperative oil association and the Little Prairie Farmers Club. He was a trustee of the Little Prairie United Methodist Church and chairman of its building fund.<br />
In 1948 he was named Farmer of the Week by the St. Paul Sunday Pioneer Press. As a Land O' Lakes director of District 6 (Rice, Goodhue, Olmsted and Wabasha counties) and president of the Rice County Farm Bureau, he was a pioneer in the cooperative movement. He was also credited with inspiring the organization of the Rice County Dairy Association. He was president of the Rice County Cooperative Association from 1955 until1966. He served on the board of the Community Co-op Oil Association of Rice County, on the district board of directors of Midland Oil and on the board of directors of Mutual Service Insurance Co.<br />
Mr. and Mrs. Illsley celebrated their 50th wedding anniversary with an observance on their lawn; where their wedding had been conducted on June 28, 1916. There were 400 guests from 11states at the golden wedding event.<br />
Mrs. Illsley, who had been an elementary teacher in rural Rice County before her marriage, died in 1979, 11 years after her husband's death. The couple had three children.<br />
Well, of course I knew the Illsleys. I interviewed him at various times. I had no idea, however, until after his death, that he did not have at least a high school education. He was surely a self-educated individual.<br />

Íñigo Íñiguez Arista (Wannaqo ibn Wannaqo, Basque: Eneko EnekonesAritza/Haritza/Aiza; c. 790 - 851 or 852) was the first King of Pamplona(c. 824 - 851 or 852). He is said by a later chronicler to have beencount of Bigorre, or at least to have come from there, but there is nonear-contemporary evidence of this.<br />
His origin is obscure, but his patronymic  indicates that he was the son of an Íñigo.  It has been speculated that he was kinsman of Garćıa Jiménez, who in the late 8th century succeeded his father Jimeno 'the Strong' in resisting Carolingian expansion into Vasconia. He is also speculated to have been related to the other Navarrese dynasty, the Jiménez.<br />
His mother also married Musa ibn Fortun ibn Qasi, by whom she was mother of Musa ibn Musa ibn Qasi, head of the Banu Qasi and Moslem ruler of Tudela, one of the chief lords of Valley of the Ebro. Due to this relationship, Íñigo and his kin frequently acted in alliance with Musa ibn Musa and this relationship allowed Íñigo to extend his influence over large territories in the Pyrenean valleys.<br />
The family came to power through struggles with Frankish and Muslim influence in Spain. In 799, pro-Frankish assassins murdered Mutarrif ibn Musa, governor of Pamplona, the brother of Musa ibn Musa ibn Qasi and perhaps of Íñigo himself. Ibn Hayyan reports that in 816, Abd al-Karim ibn Abd al-Wahid ibn Mugit launched a military campaign against the pro-Frankish "Enemy of God", Velasco the Gascon, who had united Christian factions. They fought a three-day battle and the Christians were routed, with Velasco killed along with Garćıa López, maternal uncle of Alfonso II of Asturias, Sancho "the premier warrior/knight of Pamplona", and "Saltan", similarly preeminent among the "pagans". This defeat of the pro-French force is said to have allowed the anti-French Íñigo to come to power. In 820, Íñigo is said to have intervened in the County of Aragon, ejecting a Frankish vassal, count Aznar I Gaĺındez, in favor of Garćıa el Malo (the Bad), who would become Íñigo's son-in-law. In 824, the Frankish counts Aeblus and Aznar Sánchez made an expedition against Pamplona, but were defeated in the third Battle of Roncesvalles. Traditionally, this battle led to the crowning of Íñigo as "King of Pamplona" but he continued to be called "Lord of Pamplona", as had his predecessor Velasco, by the Arabic chroniclers. Íñigo was a Christicolae princeps (Christian prince), according to Eulogio de Córdoba.[citation needed] However, his kingdom continually played Moslem and Christian against themselves and each other to maintain independence against outside powers.<br />
 <br />
In 840 his lands were attacked by Abd Allah ibn Kulayb, wali of Zaragoza, leading his half-brother, Musa ibn Musa into rebellion.[5] The next year, Íñigo fell victim to paralysis in battle against the Norse with Musa ibn Musa. His son Garćıa acted as regent, in concert with Fortún Íñiguez, "the premier knight of the realm", the king's brother and also half-brother of Musa. They joined Musa ibn Musa in an uprising against the Caliphate of Córdoba. Abd-ar-Rahman II, emir of Córdoba, launched reprisal campaigns in the succeeding years. In 843, Fortún Íñiguez was killed, and Musa unhorsed and forced to escape on foot, while Íñigo and his son Galindo escaped with wounds and several nobleman, most notably Velasco Garcés defected to Abd-ar-Rahman. The next year, Íñigo's own son, Galindo Íñiguez and Musa's son Lubb ibn Musa went over to Córdoba, and Musa was forced to submit. Following a brief campaign the next year, 845, a general peace was achieved.[6] In 850, Musa again rose in open rebellion, supported again by Pamplona,[7] and envoys of Induo (thought to be Íñigo) and Mitio,[8] "Dukes of the Navarrese", were received at the French court. Íñigo died in the Muslim year 237, which is late 851 or early 852, and was succeeded by Garćıa Íñiguez.<br />
The name of the wife (or wives) of Íñigo is not reported in contemporary records, although chronicles from centuries later assign her the name of Toda or Oneca. There is also scholarly debate regarding her derivation, some hypothesizing that she was daughter of Velasco, lord of Pamplona (killed 816), and others making her kinswoman of Aznar I Gaĺındez. He was father of the following known children:<br />
    * Assona Íñiguez, who married her father's half-brother, Musa ibn Musa ibn Fortun ibn Qasi, lord of Tudela and Huesca<br />
    * Garćıa Íñiguez, the future king<br />
    * Galindo Íñiguez, fled to Córdoba where he was friend of Eulogio of Córdoba and became father of Musa ibn Galind, Amil of Huesca in 860, assassinated in 870 [13]<br />
    * a daughter, wife of Count Garćıa el Malo (the Bad) of Aragón.<br />
 <br />
The dynasty founded by Íñigo reigned for about 80 years, being supplanted by a rival dynasty in 905. However, due to intermarriages, subsequent kings of Navarre descend from Íñigo.<br />

He was educated in Córdoba, as a guest at the court of the Emir ofCórdoba. He was the son of Íñigo Arista, the first king of their dynasty.When his father was stricken by paralysis  in 842, he became regent ofthe kingdom (or perhaps co-regent with his uncle Fortún Íñiguez). He andhis kinsman Musa ibn Musa ibn Fortún of the Banu Qasi rebelled againstthe Cordoban emir in 843. This rebellion was put down by EmirAbd-ar-Rahman II, who attacked the Kingdom of Pamplona, defeating Garćıabadly and killing Fortún. At his father's death in 851/2, he succeeded tothe crown.<br />
Following the death of Íñigo Arista, the Banu Qasi leader Musa ibn Musa pursued a policy of closer allegiance with Muhammad I of Córdoba, leaving Garćıa to look to Christian Asturias for an ally. In 859, Musa ibn Musa allowed a contingent of Vikings to pass through his lands and attack Navarre, resulting in the capture Garćıa, who was forced to pay at least 70,000 gold dinars in ransom. Later the same year, Musa ibn Musa attacked the Pamplonese city of Albelda. Garćıa and his new friend Ordoño I of Asturias together dealt Musa a crushing blow, killing, it is said, 10,000 of his magnates in the Battle of Albelda. This, in turn, provoked a Muslim response and the next year, 860, saw Garćıa's son and heir Fortún captured and imprisoned by the Moors. He languished in Córdoba for the next 20 years. In 870, Garćıa formed an alliance with the Muslim rebel Amrus ibn Amr ibn Amrus, who had killed Garcia's nephew Musa ibn Galindo of Huesca, and the next year was apparently in a new alliance with the sons of Musa ibn Musa, now in rebellion against Córdoba.<br />
Garćıa I favoured the pilgrims who travelled to Santiago de Compostela, and attempted to guarantee peace for that traffic.<br />
Garćıa's death has been subject to scholarly dispute, a result of a paucity of records from the last years of his reign. The lack of subsequent mention of him after 870 led to the suggestion that he died in that year, and as his heir was in the hands of his enemies, it was argued that Garćıa Jiménez then governed the kingdom as regent. Garćıa's son, Fortún Garcés, is then made to succeed upon his released in 880. There is, however, no evidence for such a regency, and Sanchéz Albornoz has cited evidence that Garćıa was still living at the time of his son's return. Thus it is likely that Balparda was reporting accurate tradition when he suggested Garćıa and ally Umar ibn Hafsun, fought a battle at Aybar against the troops of Emir of Córdoba in 882, Garćıa dying there (although the age provided him, 84 years, is clearly exaggerated).<br />
The identity of Garćıa's wife or wives is poorly documented, and has been subject to much speculation. An undated confirmation of an earlier lost charter refers to King Garćıa and Queen Urraca Mayor, and this is thought by some to refer to Garćıa Íñiguez and an otherwise unknown wife. Based on her name alone, it has been suggested that she was of the Banu Qasi, but other historians have given her different parentage, or even a different king as husband. Likewise, royal princess Leodegundia Ordoñez of Asturias, daughter of Ordoño I of Asturias, is known to have married a ruler of Pamplona, and Garćıa Íñiguez is one of those speculated to have been this prince.<br />
Garćıa Íñiguez had following children:<br />
    * Fortún Garcés, the future king.<br />
    * Sancho Garcés, whose only known child, Aznar Sánchez, married a daughter of king Fortún Garcés and by her had queens Toda Aznárez, wife of king Sancho Garcés I, and Sancha Aznárez, wife of king Jimeno Garcés.<br />
    * Onneca Garcés, wife of Aznar Gaĺındez II.<br />
    * Velasquita Garcés, married to Mutarrif ibn Musa ibn Qasi, Wali of Huesca, son of Musa ibn Musa.<br />
    * (perhaps) Jimena, wife of Alfonso III of León (assignment of her parentage based on political, chronological and onomastic arguments).<br />

According to "Field Genealogy," Sarah (Baldwin) (Searle) Edwards was adaughter of Sylvester Baldwin who died on the ship "Martin" whiletravelling to New England. His widow settled at New Haven then Milford,CT with her children. However, Savage and the "Register," discussing thewill of Benjamin Fenn, indicates that Sarah Baldwin, daughter ofSylvester Baldwin, married, as his first wife, Benjamin Fenn. Given thatJohn Searle was of Springfield, MA and Alexander Edwards was ofNorthampton, it seems less likely that this Sarah Baldwin, residentof CT,was daughter of Sylvester.<br />
 <br />
Perhaps this Sarah was sister of Joseph Baldwin, an early settler of Milford, CT. He and his wife were admitted as members of the church there 23 June 1644 and, in about 1663, Joseph and his wife removed to Hadley.<br />

 Wheeler  was a dedicated volunteer<br />
REDLANDS - Bettye Wheeler dedicated her life to helping people, as a nurse and as a volunteer in many Redlands organizations.<br />
She served as president of the board of Redlands Meals on Wheels and president of Redlands United Church of Christ, and she was not only a leader but a listener, according to those who worked with her.<br />
"Whenever you were talking with Bettye, she was 100 percent present, totally connected to you, taking you into her heart and reflecting herself back," said Loring Fiske-Phillips, current president of Redlands United Church of Christ. "She would always do what I term 'whole-face listening,"' he said. "Bettye was a very dynamic person," said Kathy Van Meter, a coordinator with Redlands Meals on Wheels. "We're going to miss her terribly."<br />
Wheeler died April 28 at Redlands Community Hospital, after an illness. She was 72.<br />
She first came to Redlands in 1970 when her husband, Charlie, was serving in the U.S. Air Force. They lived here until 1974, then came back in 1986.<br />
"Redlands kind of captured us," her husband said. Near the end of his Air Force career, he asked for an assignment here so they could settle in Redlands where they had made many friends and were involved in the community.<br />
Bettye Wheeler had been active with Redlands Meals on Wheels in the 1970s, and when she returned in the '80s she was soon rolling again with the organization that delivers meals to homebound people.<br />
In addition to serving as president of the board of Redlands Meals on Wheels, she had been a chairman and on the admissions committee and, of course, she delivered meals, both on a regular route and as a substitute.<br />
"She contributed a great deal to our program," Van Meter said. "She was dedicated to offering whatever help she could."<br />
Bev Woolverton, another Meals on Wheels volunteer, said Wheeler was "a great lady and a good cook, too."<br />
"She made wonderful chocolate chip cookies," Woolverton said. "She did everything with Meals on Wheels. I'm going to miss her."<br />
Bettye Jean Wheeler was born May 6, 1935, in Boonville, Ind., and received her diploma as a registered nurse at Deaconess Hospital in Evansville, Ind.<br />
Shortly after that she married and began more than 30 years as an Air Force wife. During that time she used her nursing skills as a Red Cross volunteer and registered nurse in many places.<br />
After earning her bachelor's degree in nursing from the University of Utah, she worked as a public health nurse in Hawaii and for 12 years in Riverside County before retiring.<br />
She was active in Air Force wives' clubs and church activities throughout her life.<br />
In Redlands, she was a member of Redlands United Church of Christ and served as president of the church from 1997 to 1999. She also served as a parish nurse for the church and represented Redlands United Church of Christ on the Redlands Area Interfaith Council.<br />
Some of the young people in the church called her "the youngest spirit in an old body they have ever known," according to Fiske-Phillips.<br />
He recalled that a week before she died, she wanted to be part of a small group meeting so much that she had the meeting at her house. "She 'held court,' " he said, "with the committee sitting around, soaking in her love and wisdom. You could tell she was completely in the group and outside her own health issues."<br />
At another meeting, Fiske-Phillips said, when the church board's discussion turned to finances and the fact that there often wasn't enough money to go around, she said her life's philosophy was to have as much fun as possible on the least amount of money.<br />
Fiske-Phillips said part of the church's message is: No matter who you are or where you are on life's journey, you're welcome here.<br />
"Bettye lived that message and projected that sentiment to everyone she met," he said.<br />
She was also active in the Redlands Symphony Guild.<br />
In a letter to the editor printed in today's Daily Facts, Walter Collins, former executive director of the Redlands Symphony Orchestra, wrote: "Bettye leaves a tremendous legacy of selfless wisdom and caring volunteerism, and I will cherish her memory dearly. The finer things of Our Town remain as a testament to Bettye and her indomitable spirit."<br />
Other community involvement included Redlands Family Service Association and the Wee Care child-care center at Orangewood High School, where she did child development assessment.<br />
She was a member of the PEO sisterhood, and her hobbies included cooking, sewing, reading and traveling.<br />
Survivors include her husband of 51 years, Charles Wheeler; her sons Scott Wheeler and wife Candace of Springfield, Va., and Brian Wheeler and wife Stephanie of Fairfield, Calif.; her daughters Jean Dziedzinski of Chelmsford, Mass., and Nancy Thomas and husband Paul of Loma Linda; her brother Dale Fehd and wife Michelle of Smithfield, Va.; and grandchildren Jennifer Tebbe, Jennifer Dziedzinski, Richard Dziedzinski, Katherine Thomas, Jonathan Thomas, CJ Mroz, Rachel Wheeler, Jessica Wheeler, Benjamin Wheeler, David Wheeler, Nicolaus Thomas and Cameron Wheeler.<br />
A memorial service to celebrate her life will be held at 2 p.m. Saturday, May 3, at Redlands United Church of Christ, 168 Bellevue Ave., Redlands, with the Rev. Sharon R. Graff officiating.<br />
At her request, those attending the service are asked not to wear black; aloha wear is appropriate.<br />
Graveside services will be private, at Riverside National Cemetery.<br />

 <br />
He became Count de Vendôme with death of his brother-in-law Bouchard III. He takes share with the conflict which opposed the two brothers of Anjou, Geoffroy III the Bearded one and Foulque IV Réchin. Supporting Fulk initially, he switched sides and was imprisoned by Lancelin de Beaugency and then ransomed in 1090. Like his predecessors, he feuded with the Abbey of the Trinity, a conflict that causes his excommunication. In penance, he took part in the first Crusade. He died in 1102, after being imprisoned by the Arabs by the seat of Ascalon.<br />
