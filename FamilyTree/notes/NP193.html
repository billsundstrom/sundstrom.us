Train Crash Kills Elderly Jesup Man<br>
JESUP - Every morning Hughie J. Fuller, 84, would load his cans of milk in the family car and take them to the creamery.<br>
Almost every morning he would take the same route crossing the Illinois Central Railroad tracks on 20th St.<br>
Saturday morning was no different. Fuller loaded the milk in the car and set off for the creamery.<br>
He crossed the tracks at 7:25 AM but Fuller apparently failed to see a passenger train speeding east. It rammed his auto broadside and threw him out of the car, killing him outright.<br>
The car was pushed 266 feet and was a total loss. There are no warning lights at the crossing.<br>
Engineer of the train was R. J. Bradfield of Cedar Falls.<br>
Two years ago, on Aug 15, 1964, a few blocks east, a train car collision killed George Damme of Casper, Wyo., his wife and daughter. This fatality prompted the installation of automatic grade crossing signals at that intersection.<br>
Funeral services for Fuller will be 2 PM tomorrow at the First Presbyterian church here with burial in the Cedar Crest Cemetery. The Parker Funeral Home is in charge.<br>
The retired farmer is survived by his widow; two sons, Walter of Dubuque and Harold of Emmestburg; a daughter, Mrs. Gertrude Widdel of Waterloo; three brothers, Elmer of Jesup, Earl of Clear Lake and George of California and a sister, Mrs. A. C. Debacca of Los Angeles.<br>
