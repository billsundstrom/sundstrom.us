Thomas MINER
<p>
<a name ="I005819"><b>[I005819]</b></a><br />
THOMAS MINER / MINOR was born in Chew Magna, county of Somerset, England on 23 April 1608, son of Clement Miner. He emigrated to Massachusetts, USA perhaps in 1629 on the Lyon's Whelp as Banks 9  states or maybe a couple of years later on the Arabella as many older writings claim, all apparently without any real proof. The first reference to Thomas is in the formation record of Congregational Church of Charlestown, Massachusetts dated 2 November 1632 (Ch ChR). That record refers to him and the others listed as dismissed from the Boston Church on Oct 14, 1632.<br>
Thomas Miner married Grace PALMER on 23 April 1634 in Massachusetts. She was born about 1612, the daughter of Walter Palmer of Charlestown. Their first child, John, was born in Charlestown, and then in 1636 they moved to Hingham, MA where more children were born.<br>
In 1645, they joined John Winthrop Jr. and company in the settlement of New London, CT. On 15 Oct 1652 Thomas sold his home lot in New London located at the head of Close Cove and settled in Stonington, CT with William Chesebrough, Thomas Stanton, and his father-in-law, Walter Palmer. The Stonington Historical Society has more information on the settling of the town. There is a monument to these founders (dedicated 31 August 1899) located in the Wequetequock Cemetery with one side dedicated to Thomas.<br>
In 1653 he bought some land from Cary Latham and moved from the Wequetequock area to the west side of the mouth of Quiambaug Cove near Mystic, CT and began one of the few diaries to survive from this period. This diary covers the period from 1653 through 1684 and was published as a book11 in 1899.<br>
He was among those who began the church at Stonington in June 1674. He was active in the affairs in both New London and Stonington and held many public service positions of trust and honor including deputy to the Connecticut General Court.<br>
He is the Thomas Miner who wrote back to England about 1683/4 and received a essay which explores the Miner versus Minor spelling of the name and traces the Miner ancestry back to the 1300s. The information in this document including the coat of arms it presents are believed to be false. After receiving this document, many his descendants generally used the Miner spelling of the name although some retained the Minor spelling especially his son John of Woodbury, CT.<br>
He died in Stonington, CT on 23 October 1690, and his wife died there on 31 December 1690. Both are buried at Stonington in the Wequetequock Cemetery under a prone, inscribed granite slab which reads "HERE LYES THE BODY OF LIUTENANT THOMAS MINOR AGED 83 -- DEPARTED 1690" and on the other side "HIS WIFE 1608 GRACE PALMER 1690" To get to Wequetequock Cemetery take Route 1, east from Stonington, CT or west from Pawcatuck, CT. When you reach the head of the cove, at the stop light, turn south on to Greenhaven Road, then take an immediate right onto Palmer Road. The cemetery is on your left.<br>
