Allan Barnett LASHER
<p>
<a name ="I026321"><b>[I026321]</b></a><br />
Allan B. Lasher, who distributed the people's justice along with humor and compassion for a quarter century on the Los Angeles Municipal Court-including a storied term directing hundreds of anxious defendants per day through the travails of Traffic Court -died of complications from stroke on July 11 at home. He was 78 years old. <br>
Commissioner Lasher - El Jefe of Division 60 - began his legal career at UCLA (BA 1957, Law 1960) and in 1961 founded a private practice, Green, Simke, & Lasher, with his close friend. Advocate for free speech (including work for the Lenny Bruce defense team), underdogs, and the Gardena poker rooms, Lasher was generous, brilliant, incorrigible, and self-effacing. He liked to cite the observation that "Traffic Court is...the only Court in which most people have any personal experience...the Court that provides most people with their understanding and appreciation of our system of Justice." He wrote: "We continually strive to do Justice, and to make our Court an instrument of Justice and of a Just society." <br>
To quote a few of the citizens he served: "Commissioner Lasher is the very best example of a public servant." "Sometimes a person can see that America is all it claims to be! A place where you do get a chance for Liberty and Justice regardless to station or wealth." "Guilty or not a person feels like a person in your court." "It was actually a privilege to be in attendance at your courtroom. P.S. Incidentally the prison food in here stinks!" <br>
In loving partnership with and inspired by the social work of his wife of 53 years, Darlene Dwyer Lasher, Al established and directed a charitable foundation in support primarily of social and medical services. Al and Darlene met in the 1950s working along with dear friends at UCLA's Uni-Camp. They reunited annually with other impassioned and beloved friends, from as far back as Emerson Junior High, for camaraderie at NN Lake, Timber Cove, and Balboa Island. <br>
Sometime dog "trainer," gifted CPA, knowledgeable jazz, blues, and folk music enthusiast, and reference bookworm, Al never met a thesaurus or book of quotations he didn't like. Comrade to many from all walks of life, he joined with Will Rogers in saying that there are no strangers, only friends we haven't met yet. His favorite reading included The Treasure of Sierra Madre, The Ox-Bow Incident, and the Obituary Section. Al delighted family and friends with his rousing tales about Brave Little Dog -- with their faith in the unsung hero, which he himself was. <br>
Al leaves a legacy of his principled values and vision to his children and grandchildren. His silent generosity, inventive thoughtfulness, and cryptic wit will be missed by all those whose lives he touched. Al would want especially to express his gratitude to his personal physician and the many medical professionals who helped him with skill and compassion. <br>
He was the devoted son of Muriel Cohen and Louis L. Lasher. Al is survived by wife Darlene, son Michael Allan, daughter Susan and son-in-law Chris Pfister, treasured grandchildren Luke, Robin, and Claire, beloved sister and brother-in-law Carole and Dr. Warren Greene, sister-in-law Nancy Appleton, niece Laurie (Mark) Schmid, and nephew Greg Jacobs. <br>
Services will be private. In lieu of flowers, donations may be sent to OPCC in Santa Monica.<br>

Walter George LASRICH
<p>
<a name ="I100244"><b>[I100244]</b></a><br />
Walter George Lasrich, known as "Money", passed away at Eisenhower Medical Center in Rancho Mirage, California on Friday, December 7, 2007 of complications related to a Subdural Hematoma suffered on December 2nd. He was born in Salt Lake City on June 2, 1916 and married Beverley Benson on December 11, 1943. She predeceased him on December 15, 1988. Money continued to live alone in his homes in Sandy, Utah and Indian Wells, California.<br>
Money is survived by his son, Lane, daughter-in-law, Karen, long time companion June Hellstrom, and three grandchildren, Lee, Lauren, and Chad. <br>
Money and Beverley moved to California after getting married, and returned to Salt Lake in the late forties. He worked in the dairy business for years and had his own ice cream stores, appropriately, called "Money's Ice Cream". In the seventies he began working with Beverley in oil and natural gas exploration. Money took the proceeds from those ventures and invested in stocks and bonds during the rest of his years. Investments turned into his great passion with the daily ritual of the Wall Street Journal, CNBC, and Matlock for fun.<br>
Money was very lucky to have been married to Beverley for nearly forty-five years and then to have the love and companionship of June Hellstrom for the last eighteen. Beverley and Money were charter members of Willow Creek Country Club. June and Money continued to enjoy Willow Creek and all the friendships from there will be cherished by June and the Lasrich family.<br>
Family and Friends are invited to a celebration of Money's life at Willow Creek County Club from noon to 3 p.m. on Saturday, December 15, 2007.<br>

<p>
<a name ="I072406"><b>[I072406]</b></a><br />
We deeply regret to announce the death of Mr. Philip C. Latham, of this city, which took place at 8 o'clock yesterday morning, at his residence, on 7th street. For some time Mr. Latham had been considerably indisposed, but there was nothing in his symptoms which caused any alarm. He arose yesterday while the family were at breakfast, and was in the act of bathing himself at the water stand, when he was stricken with apoplexy, and fell heavily to the floor. A physician was at once summoned, but he was beyond the reach of medical skill, and expired in a few minutes afterward. Mr. Latham was the son of the late Philip C. Latham, Esq., of this city, and was in the twenty-seventh year of his age. He was an active and enterprising business man; full of generous impulses, and possessed the esteem of all who knew him. He leaves a widow and one child. His funeral will take place on Saturday. <br>

John LATHROP
<p>
<a name ="I009181"><b>[I009181]</b></a><br />
He was the second pastor of the first Independent (Congregational) Church in London. At that time the King, Charles I, was in a conflict with Parliament. Puritans Presbyterians and Independents, all dissenters from the Church of England supported Parliament. This conflict led up to the English Civil War. King Charles I would be beheaded in 1649 by forces led by Lord Cromwell during the English Civil War.<br>
<br>
As a result of the political conflict between King Charles and Parliament religious dissenters were persecuted. Rev John was imprisoned from 1632 to 1634. While in prison his wife, Hannah House, died. He was banished to America upon his release. He led a group of followers to Scituate, MA. They sailed on 18 Sept. 1634 on the Griffin to Boston Ma. He became pastor of the First Church in Scituate where he remained till 1639 when a dispute split the church. Rev John led a group of his followers to Barnstable Mass., about 40 miles to the south east on the north shore of Cape Cod. Barnstable considers Rev John Lothrop to be its founder and has several references to him on its web pages. His house is now the town library.<br>
<br>
Rev. John was one of Thomas's sons whom Thomas had educated and thus provided with means of self-maintenance, and, therefore, was excluded from the benefits of his will.<br>
<br>
Of the early life of Mr. Lothrop little is known. The Rev. Dr. John Lothrop, late of Boston, in a memoir published in the first volume of the second series of the Mass. Historical Society's publications, says that these is "no doubt that Oxford was the place of Mr. Lothrop's public education." He refers to Wood's 'Athenoe et Fasti Oxonienses, published in 1691, as his authority. Wood professes to record the names of those "who have been admitted to one of two academical degree of degrees, in the ancient and most famous university of Oxford." He names "Mr. John Lothrop" not however in the list of those educated at that university. Mr. Savage, who has given much attention to the subject, and has personally examined the records of several of the colleges, says tradition is the authority for the statement that Mr. Lothrop was educated at Oxford. Deane, in his history of Scituate, states that Mr. Lothrop was educated at Oxford. He relied on Dr. Lothrop as his authority, who evidently mistakes the meaning of the passage in Wood's Fasti. John matriculated at Queens College, Cambridge in 1601. He received his Bachelor of Arts degree in 1605 and, in 1607,on his twenty-third birthday, John was ordained a deacon by the Bishop of Lincoln and began service for the Church of England as a curate of Bennington, Hertfordshire. After graduation in 1609 with a Master of Arts degree, John Lothrop was admitted as the perpetual curate in charge of the Egerton Church in Kent,a parish four miles east of Eastwell and forty-eight miles southeast of London. This was the second and last parish in which he officiated for the Anglican Church.  The ancestor of the family wrote his name John Lothropp. All his sons omitted the final p. His son Samuel sometimes wrote his name Lathrop, and many of his descendants in Connecticut and Western Massachusetts so spell the name. In the records we find the name written Lathropp, Lothrop, Lathrop, Laythrop and Lawthrop. In Wood's Fasti the name is written Lathrop and Lowthrope. Calamy, Neal, Crosley, Winthrop and Prince, write the name Lathrop.  In 1624 Mr. Lothrop removed to London, and was chosen the successor of the Rev. Henry Jacob, the first pastor of the first Independent or Congregationalist Society in London. Wood, speaking of Mr. Jacob, says he "was a Kentish man, born in 1563, entered a commoner in Saint Maries Hall<br>
