<br>
Ancestry from Kenelm back has been researched but no agreement has been reached by scholars as to the correct ancestry. There seems to be real doubt that Catherine was the mother of Edward who married Magdalene Ollyver. "New Eng Hist & Gen Reg" V. 121 pg 25-29, an article by John G. Hunt, B.S.C. of Arlington, Va., discusses possible Winslow ancestry and says his mother "seems most surely to have been Elizabeth Morgan. Subsequent articles in V. 122 & 124 discusses the various opinions and argue that the strongest evidences favor Elizabeth Folliot<br>

Kenelm's father given elsewhere as William Winslowe, son of Thomas Winslowe Esq. (son of Thomas Winselow of Burton, Oxford, England) and Celia Tansley<br>
