Simon de Senilis de ST. LIZ
<p>
<a name ="I005096"><b>[I005096]</b></a><br />
On the history of the Earldom of Huntingdon:<br>
His [Waltheof's] son-in-law Simon de St Liz was the next holder of the Earldom [of Huntingdon], the family connections of Simon's wife Maudmaking the transition a natural one under the terms prevailing then. Indeed the history of the Earldom over the next few decades amplyillustrates the almost chattel-like nature of such a title at this time,a quasi-hereditary post which was nevertheless as often as not held from the king at pleasure and which could be transferred between members of the same family like a parcel of land. [Burke's Peerage]<br>

Simon II de ST. LIZ
<p>
<a name ="I012517"><b>[I012517]</b></a><br />
Simon de St. Senlis<br>
on the history of the Earldom of Huntingdon:<br>
<br>
After Earl Simon's [Matilda's 1st husband] death, his Widow married David I of Scotland, who consequently became Earl of Huntingdon too, keeping the Earldom even after he succeeded his brother as King of Scots. He sided with the Empress Maud against Stephen I but came to terms with the latter and made the Earldom over to his son Henry. Henry swore fealty to Stephen but subsequently fought against him under the Scottish banner,which may account for Simon de St Liz's son, another Simon, being recognized as Earl of Huntingdon before Henry's death in 1152. [Burke'sPeerage]<br>

Advocate of St Butin at St. Omer, Earl of Chester; father of Gherbod the<br>
Fleming, Earl of Chester, and Gundrada.<br>
<br>
*   Advocate of the abbey of St. Bestin, at St. Omer. His liaison with<br>
    Matilda of Flanders, pri or to her marriage to William, produced Gundred.<br>
    [Magna Charta Barons, p. 80]<br>
*   A valiant Fleming who was an Earl of Chester prior to the Conqueror's<br>
    invasion. He soon dep arted into Flanders, where he was detained a<br>
    prisoner and in his place in Chester, the Conque ror put his nephew Hugh<br>
    d'Aurange/Hugh Lupus. [The Bruces and the Cumyns, p. 512]<br>
    This source says he was a son of Queen Matilda during a clandestine<br>
    marriage prior to her mar riage to William. William's treatment of him<br>
    following the invasion would more likely suppor t that he was a former<br>
    lover of Queen Matilda. [Falaise Roll, p. 52]<br>
