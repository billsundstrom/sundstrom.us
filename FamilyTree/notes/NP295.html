Ansel Root KINGSLEY
<p>
<a name ="I001655"><b>[I001655]</b></a><br />
By Benita Devney<br>
<br>
This history was written as a part of the Eureka Township Centennial 1954<br>
<br>
The building of the Dodd road, from Fort Snelling to Saint Peter, passing through Eureka Township, played an important part in the settlement of the town. Early in the fifties, hopes were high throughout Minnesota, that Saint Peter was the coming city of the new territory.<br>
<br>
In May of 1853, the Kingsley brothers, Cyrus, Dwight, and Ancil, under the direction of a Captain Dodd, began work on this territorial road. By the latter part of June, their work had brought them to a portion of the road, afterward included within the boundaries of Eureka Township. When at the point (now in section 7), where the Dodd road crosses the Vermillion River, Captain Dodd was so impressed with the loveliness of the spot he told Cyrus Kingsley to build a log pen and stakeout a claim of one hundred and sixty acres for him. His interest was short lived, for he soon forgot his claim as his work carried him along the new road. However, his fellow workers, the Kingsley brothers, could not forget.<br>
<br>
While spending the winter of 1853-54 in St. Paul, where they built the city's first foundry buildings, the brothers met an old friend from the east, Benjamin Caskey, who was looking for a good location. Impressed with the Kingsleys description of lands waiting to be taken along the Dodd road, Caskey set out alone, in May, on a prospecting tour. As chance would have it, he settled on the exact claim staked out the year before by Captain Dodd.<br>
<br>
A few weeks later, two of the Kingsley brothers, Cyrus, and Dwight came down the road to be Caskeys neighbors, even sharing his cabin for a time. For the first house, in Eureka, was built by Cyrus Kingsley and Benjamin Caskey on the latters claim during July 1854. In terms of today, this first cabin was located near the home of Mr. and Mrs. Harold Pool, present owners of the old claim.<br>
<br>
The cabin was typical of those days, built of logs and about fourteen by eighteen feet in dimensions. For beds, wooden pins were driven into the logs and slabs or poles were laid upon them. A foot or so of wild hay completed the crude beds. The nearest neighbors were a camp of fifteen lodges of Dakota Indians.<br>
<br>
That summer, Dwight Kingsley brought his wife from St. Paul and they soon built a cabin on Dwight's claim in the southeast quarter of section 6. Since both claims were located near the Dodd, the only road through the area, Alexander Faribault and other important personages, as well as the most humble of early pioneers shared the warm hearted hospitality of Eureka's first citizens, the Caskeys and the Kingsleys.<br>
<br>
Writing for the Dakota County Tribune in 1904, Dwight Kingsley, then living in Minneapolis, told this about Old Days in Eureka:<br>
<br>
"I am one of the first settlers of Eureka Township and the only one now alive that first settled in Eureka. At the beginning, my brother Ancil R. and Cyrus M., with myself, worked cutting the Dodd road through, under the direction of Captain Dodd. We worked from May 3rd to June 20th, 1853, then went across country to what is now Union Lake. We followed the Indian trail to Black Dog and came to St. Paul by way of Mendota. I never received one cent for my work on the Dodd from Captain Dodd or anyone else. I went east and married Ellen Caskey and made for Minnesota again, as I thought the winter was the nicest I ever saw. I came back with my wife in the spring of 1854, on April 13, my birthday, and reached St. Paul in ten days. Stayed there until July and then made a break for a farm and I settled in Eureka at the head of the Vermillion River. It was as handsome a stream as I ever knew. My partners were Ben Caskey and wife. In the course of two or three months, I found I had some neighbors about three miles from me at Chub Lake by the name of Peter Sampson. They had some cows and two horses. In the spring of 1855, James Caskey came in. He had left his wife behind and soon got sick of farming and sold out to his brother Henry.<br>
<br>
I built a shanty on land Joseph Mallery now owns. There were a good many people traveling to Faribault. They used to stop with us sometimes and we had them lying on the floor two or three thick."<br>
<br>
On July 18, 1854, Peter Sampson and his son Magnus; Ole Torrison and Ole H. Oleson Halling, all Norwegians, arrived at Chub Lake, from Wisconsin. Mr. Sampson took a claim in section 22 and 27. The Torrisons and Olesons located claims in section 21.<br>
<br>
During the fall of that year, Peter Sampson and Ole Torrison built cabins on their claims. These two cabins, with those of Benjamin Caskey and Dwight Kingsley, making four in all, were the only houses in Eureka in 1854.<br>
<br>
The summer of '54 also brought Slyvester Bell to the community. To him goes the credit for breaking the first land in the township, during the summer of 1854, on his claim in section 5. He broke about five acres with a plow drawn by oxen. Corn and a little wheat were planted. The wheat was cut with a cradle, tied in bundles with grass. It was used for hay.<br>
<br>
Ancil Kingsley arrived in December of 1854 and took a claim in the southwest quarter of section 6, next to his brother Dwight.<br>
</p>

<a name ="I011811"><b>[I011811]</b></a><br />

Betty attended and graduated as one of the first United States Cadet Nurse Corps, St. Holy Rosary Hospital, Miles City, MT. Registered Nurse, 1948. Her nursing career of 60 plus years consisted of head nurse in surgery and emergency room, public health, flight nurse, labor and delivery and finishing as a clinic nurse. While still working in her later years, she began to enjoy new hobbies of bowling (25 years, competing in tournaments), golf (Tuesday morning league play) and her continued love of sewing and quilting. She retired at the age of 80. Every aspect of Bettyʼs life was through strong passion and grace. Her smile was beautiful and we will miss her dearly.<br>
Betty is survived by her son, Clifford Thomas (Linda) of Valley Springs, CA., step-son, Mickey Hand of Jackson, CA; daughters, Ramona Hand of Jackson, CA., Carolyn Hand of Lawrence, KS., and Connie (Daryl) Blohm of Henderson, NV.<br>

a native of the old "Bay State," was born in Hampshire county, March 8th, 1831. His ancestors date their lineage back to the pilgrim fathers. He was reared and received a liberal education in his native land, in the meantime learning the trade of carpenter and builder.

During the spring of 1853 he was engaged in the construction of the old "Dodd" road, for which service it happens he never received his pay. Returning to St. Paul, he worked in the sash and door factory until winter, then entered a foundry. Mr. Kingsley constructed the first foundry buildings in that city. In 1868 he made a claim in section 8, where he has since lived, now having one of the prettiest homes and finest improved estates in the county.
