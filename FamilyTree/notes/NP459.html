Despite the loss of her mother, the family remained together and a lifelong commitment to family was established. Clara married her childhood sweetheart, Henry Dippold, in 1929. They were the parents of eight children, yet there was always room for one more at the table. Thanksgiving was always a special celebration for Clara. Last month, 115 family members gathered for dinner and Mrs. Dippold continued her tradition of supervising the preparation of the meal. Although Clara was busy raising eight children, she also worked outside the home. Mrs. Dippold worked at the Easy Washer Company, Gratzer's Dairy, and the North Syracuse School District. She was a member of Luther Memorial Lutheran Church and a member of the Mattydale-Hinsdale Senior Citizens Club. <br>

Lebanon, N.H. - Bernard F. Rogers , Sr., a long-time resident of Hartford, Vt., and for the past five years of Rogers House in Lebanon, died Wednesday, July 8, 2015 at the home of one of his daughters in Canaan, N.H. He was 91, and pre-deceased by his wife of 55 years, Viola, who died in 2001, and two sons, Gary and David, who died at birth.

Pfc.

As a vocation, Mr. Rogers was a Master Electrician for most of his life, but he was also a man of uncommon common sense and inventiveness.

<p>
<a name ="I005637"><b>[I005637]</b></a><br />
Arrived on the Mayflower with his father.<br>
Arriving with his father late in 1620, he was granted two acres in 1623, one in his own right and one in his father's right.<br>
On the 1627 cattle division list he appears with (Gov.) William Brandford, with whom he may have lived after having been orphaned.<br>
In 1633 he was made a freeman and that same year paid tax with his brother John. He was in Duxbury early and on March 2, 1635/36 he was permitted to operate a ferry across the Jones River; he was granted thirty acres of land November 5, 1638; he was appointed constable a t Duxbury March 3, 1639/40. With his brother John and others, he had a grant of fifty acres at North River (Marshfield) April 6, 1640. He is last mentioned at Duxbury July 31, 1646, but by the following year appears at Nusett (Eastham), where he was appointed as lieutenant of the trained band June 1, 1647. He served on the Council of War in June and October 1658; released from his lieutenancy in 1661, he was reestablished in 1664. He was selectman for Eastman in 1670.<br>
His will, made January 2, 1677/78, was proved March 5, 1667/78; the inventory was taken January 15, 1677/78.<br>
<br>
SOURCE: Mayflower Desc. Fisch.<br>
DEATH DATE: Between January 2 & 15, 1677/8.<br>

<br>
********************************************************<br>
<br>
Before coming to the New World, Rogers was part of the Leiden congregation in the Netherlands. He came to the Plymouth colony on the Mayflower, in the company of his father, Thomas Rogers. By 1639 he had moved to Duxbury; he is noted as requesting land in that area in 1638 and is named on a committee for the Duxbury highway repair in 1638/39. He is mentioned as "of Duxborrow" in the records of a 1646 land sale. Rogers probably moved very soon after this mention, as he is named lieutenant of Nauset (later Eastham) in 1647. In Eastham, he might have taken up residence with Beriah Higgens, as in his will he mentions that he "lived with him a Greate while." Rogers lived in Eastham until his death.<br>
<br>
Although his father did not survive the first winter, Joseph's brother John took his chances in the New World and at an unknown date joined his brother in Plymouth. It is uncertain whether Rogers' sisters Elizabeth and Margaret ever came to the colony; they were listed as living in Leiden in 1622.<br>

Mary Gail ROGERS
<p>
<a name ="I029622"><b>[I029622]</b></a><br />
MARY GAIL FISKE, daughter of Arthur G. Rogers, who was born and raised in ASBURY PARK, transitioned on Friday, Sept. 14, in Cornwall, Pa., where she moved with her husband in 1995. "If Jesus goes with me, I'll go anywhere! 'Tis heaven to me, where'er I may be, If he is there!" This chorus to a hymn provided comfort to Mary Gail as a child when she was confronted with uncertain situations. She would sing it to herself as she went through whatever was before her. Now, some 80 years later, knowing that she would soon be leaving this life for a new adventure in spirit, she once again thought of this chorus and was comforted. She graduated from Asbury Park High School in 1939, and attended Penn State University studying home economics for a year. It is there she met her husband, Robert K. Fiske, whom she married four years later. She took business courses at Monmouth Junior College with the idea of working in her father's moving business, but her compassion and need to help others soon led her in another direction. She attended the School of Nursing at St. Luke's Hospital in New York City, where she graduated in 1944 with a nursing degree. She and her husband moved to Ithaca, N.Y., where they lived for 40 years and raised their family. Mary Gail worked as a public health nurse and a school nurse until she retired. "Gail," as most people called her, has now joined her husband, Bob, who transitioned before her in 2000.<br>
She is survived by her four children, Susan, Linda, Roger and Mary Ann; and her four grandchildren, Jason, Jessica, David and Brian.<br>
Memorial services will be held at 1 p.m. Saturday, Sept. 22, at the Cornwall United Methodist Church Chapel, Alden Street, Cornwall, Pa.

After graduating in 1910, he began working for the Millers Falls Company taking a position in the heat and dirt of the foundry core room. He soon became a machinist in the Automatic Screw Department and moved from there to the tool room where he became the companyʼs head draftsman. In 1915, Philip Rogers was promoted to head of the operationʼs Production Planning Department, a position he left in 1917-the year that the United States entered the Great European War. Rogers enlisted in the armed forces, served a two-year tour as an ordnance lieutenant in Rochester, New York, and returned to the factory as assistant plant superintendent in 1919.(1)<br>
Rogers became Millers Falls Company president in 1920 and stayed with the job for forty-two years. His first decade of service resulted in the acquisition of the National Machine Company, the West Haven Manufacturing Company and the Accurate Level Company-purchases that were made to expand and solidify the companyʼs product line. The decade was notable as well for the introduction of the firmʼs first electric tools, a necessary development if the business was to remain competitive in a rapidly changing market. In 1930, Rogers presided over a merger that resulted in the Millers Falls Company absorbing the nearby and overextended Goodell-Pratt operation-a failing business almost as large as Millers Falls itself. The merger took place against the backdrop of the Great Depression and required a massive consolidation of the product line during an economic downturn so severe that plant operations were curtailed to several days per week. As the decade wore on, the companyʼs prospects gradually improved, and the beginning of World War II brought with it an unprecedented demand for the operationʼs tools.<br>
Rogers found managing the business during the Second World War to be particularly stressful. A biography of the long-time president in the November 1955 issue of Dyno-mite, the companyʼs employee magazine, noted:<br>
"The problems multiplied fast in 1940, before we were drawn into World War II ... More production, more, and still more! Fewer men to man the machines and still fewer. Green help, trainees, long hours, overtime pay. Security regulations and government controls. These soon became the order of the day. P. R. [Philip Rogers] gave up golf about that time. He just didnʼt feel like playing when he left his office at the end of a dayʼs work."<br>
In addition to his duties as president of a company that had become a national defense contractor, Rogers volunteered as coordinator of the Greenfield-Athol region for the Massachusetts Industrial Committee for National Defense and served on the Greenfield National Defense Committee. He never did return to his regular golf game after the war ended but unwound instead by walking his dog, doing crossword puzzles, reading four daily newspapers and looking through the weekly news magazines. Early to bed and early to rise, Philip Rogers enjoyed listening to popular and classical music but was slow to accept the idea of watching television.<br>
A product of his times, Rogers practiced an approach to employee management that is commonly referred to as paternalism. Although the practice is at times maligned by historians, relations between labor and management at the Millers Falls plants were generally good. As Philip Rogers grew older, both he and Earl D. Holtby-the companyʼs chief financial officer-grew financially conservative. Their cautious approach to re-investing in the firm gradually took a toll on the operation, and by the time of Rogersʼ retirement in 1962, the companyʼs facilities and tooling had become substandard.<br>
Philip Rogers served as a director for Greenfield First National Bank and Trust and as a trustee of the Franklin Savings Institute. He and his wife, the former Rubie Dumont, had one son, whom they named George. Philip Rogers died in October of 1971.<br>

Thomas ROGERS
<p>
<a name ="I005639"><b>[I005639]</b></a><br />
Thomas Rogers became a citizen of Leyden on 25 June 1618 with sponsors William Jepson and Roger Wilson, and was called a Camlet-merchant. Two years later, on 1 April 1620, he sold his house in Leyden before coming to America on the Mayflower.<br>
<br>
Thomas was the 18th signer of the Mayflower compact.<br>
<br>
Thomas brought his son Joseph with him on the Mayflower. He died the first winter, but his son survived. William Bradford in his Of Plymouth Plantation writes of Thomas Rogers: "the rest of Thomas Rogers' [children] came over and are married and have many children."<br>
<br>
In the 1622 poll tax for Leyden are listed his wife Elsgen (Alice), and daughters Lysbeth (Elizabeth) and Grietgen (Margaret), and son John. John Rogers is known to have come to America and married, but the whereabouts of Elizabeth and Margaret remain unknown, though Bradford seems to suggest they came to America and married.<br>

The name of his wife has not been determined. Thomas Rogers was a "Camlet" (a European n fabric of silk & wool) merchant in London and Leyden, Holland. His place in London seems t o have been in the parish of St. Bartholomew the Great where he was a taxpayer, together wit h Christopher Martin, Governor of the Mayflower, and John Hooke. He early became interested in the Pilgrim movement, and was a member of the Leyden, Holand congregation on or before June 25, 1618. He seems to have been fairly well off.<br>
In order to finance his trip on the Mayflower he sold his house on Barbara Lane in Leyden Apr 1, 1620, to a party by the name of Mordeca Cohen for 300 gilders.<br>
Thomas Rogers may be related to George Rogers-Student at Leyden University who lived wit h Thomas Blossom. George Rogers matriculated in Medicine Oct. 27, 1609, then 25. Accompanied by his youngest son Joseph, then about 12 years old, he crossed the ocean in the Mayflower, and became one of the signers of the famous compact. Unfortunately he died at an early age soon after landing at Plymouth in Feb., 1621, and his grave is on "Burial Hill" alongside t hose of his friends who died in that first winter of terrible hardship.<br>
Governor Bradford in his history of Plymouth Plantation states that the other children o f Thomas Rogers came over later.<br>
Incidentally his neighbor in London, Mr. Christopher Martin, was a member of the Merchant Adventurers, and appointed by them Governor of the Mayflower, and also Treasurer. There is good reason to suspect that Thomas Rogers was also a member of the Adventurers. He became a citizen of Leyden in 1618, guaranteed by Wm. Jepson and Roger Wilson.<br>
POSSIBLE CHILDREN OF THOMAS ROGERS BORN ENGLAND; I. Joseph, b.1607/8, II(?)Thomas, b.1600 /8(?) III. John, b.abt.1611, d. bet. August 26, 1691-Sept.20, 1692 IV.(?)William,b.1613(?) V.(? )James, b.1615(?) VI. dau. perhaps VII Noah(?) VIII Probably other children.<br>
NOTE: Of the above children the General Society of Mayflower Descendants has accepted a s clearly established as sons of THOMAS ROGERS, the Mayflower Passenger, I Joseph, b. 1607/8( ?) and III John, b.1611(?). However, William Bradford stated other members of his family came to America, and many good arguments have been, or could be advanced, especially in the case s of IV William, b. 1613(?) and V James, b. 1615<br>
<br>
Thomas Rogers and his son Joseph came to the colonies at Plymouth Rock on December 21, 1620 aboard the "Mayflower".<br>
It seems that his wife and the rest of the family came over later, there were three other children all born in England or Wales I am not sure which, my dad "Elmer" claimed Wales.<br>
We believed he was one of the one who grew sick and were tended by William Brewster an d Miles Standish. We believe he and the 51 others who perished of scurvy and pneumonia were buried in the mass gravesite called Cole's Hill. They were buried there and all signs remove d to prevent desecration by the Indians. (Can find no further record of this person)<br>

Rollo ROGNVALDSSON
<p>
<a name ="I095810"><b>[I095810]</b></a><br />
Viking Leader. Rollo Rognvaldsson, "The Dane" baptized Robert I. Rollo was a Norse Viking and first ruler of the French territory that became Normandy. His name Rollo is the Latin translation of this Norse or Scandanavian name of Hrofl. He is often confused with Granger Hrofl, or Hfolf the Walker, son of Rognavald Eystiensson., an Earl in Norway. Rollo had two wives, the first being Gisela, the daughter of the King of France, Charles the Simple and an unknown mother. His second wife was Poppa, said to be the daughter of Count Berenger de Bayeux, captured during a raid and kept in Viking tradition. They had the following children: William Longspee "Longsword", and Gerloc, the wife of William III, Duke of Aquitaine. His parentage is questioned, although famous tales and historical documents speak of a Danish king with two sons, Gurim and Rollo, who were killed and banished respectively. The debate is a sensitive matter that continues today. His life after leaving his homeland, however, is well documented. Rollo was amoung the Vikings who besieged Paris in 885 under a Dane named Sigfied. When Sigfried returned home, Rollo remained and with his Norsemen invaded northern France and Chartres. The Bishop of Chartres went for help and only the Carolingian King, Robert of Nuestria and Richard Autun of Burgundy declared, their forces pushed back the Vikings at the Battle of Chartres on the 20th of July, 911. It soon became apparent Rollo was not present for bounty as much as he desired land and permanent residence. The King of France, Charles the Simple, who neglected to send support at Chartres, decided making a treaty would be most beneficial for all. Attacks from other Vikings in the same area were common, with the French being at a disadvantage in their style of warfare. Granting that coast line to Rollo was a perfect solution. Who better to defeat the invading Vikings that a Viking with land to protect. In exchange for peace, the Treaty of Saint Clair-sur-Epte stipulated Rollo would have lands above the Seine, centered around Rouen in Normandy, marry one of the illegitimate daughter of Charles, Gisela, convert to Christianity, thus the name Robert, and pledge his allegiance to Charles. Rollo may have defended the coastline as promised, but he continued to assert his attacks on neighboring Flanders. The legend has it that Rollo was required to kiss the foot of the French King. Rollo found this take beneath him, and assigned a warrior to take his place. The warrior was of equal mind, and instead of lowering himself for this kiss, brought the King's foot up so high the King fell over. King Charles was deposed by Robert I in 922, leading Rollo to consider his pledges to a French king null and void. His army, now known as Normans, continued to conqueror surrounding areas. While his exact death is not known, Rollo passed his holdings to his son around 927, and was dead by 933. Rollo's descendants include William the Conqueror, all current day European rulers as well as the present day English royalty.<br>
