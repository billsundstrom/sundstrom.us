 WOODEN
<p>
<a name ="I005199"><b>[I005199]</b></a><br />
Odin is considered to be the supreme god of late Germanic and Norse mythology. His role, like many of the Norse pantheon, is complex: he is god of both wisdom and war. He is also attributed as being a god of magic, poetry, victory, and the hunt.<br>
<br>
His name is, in Icelandic/Old Norse Óđinn; Swedish Oden; English/Old English (and Old Saxon) Wõden; Old Franconian Wodan; Alemannic Wuodan; German Wotan or Wothan; Lombardic Godan. Although its precise mythological meaning is debated, the name is formed from òđ and -in. In Old Norse, òđ means by itself '"wit, soul" and in compounds "fierce power, energy;" the suffix -in means "master, lord." Thus, Odin is lord of the life force.<br>
<br>
Eddaic Odin<br>
According to the Edda, Odin was a son of Bestla and Bor and brother of Vé and Vili and together with these brothers he cast down the frost giant Ymir and created the world from Ymir's body. The three brothers are often mentioned together. "Wille" is the German word for "will" (English), "Weh" is the German word (Gothic wai) for "woe" (English: great sorrow, grief, misery) but is more likely related to the archaic German "Wei" meaning 'sacred'.<br>
<br>
Odin fathered his most famous son Thor on Jord 'Earth'. But his wife and consort was the goddess Frigg who in the best-known tradition was the loving mother of their son Baldr). By the giantess Grı́đr, Odin was the father of Vı́đarr and by Rind he was father of Vali. Also many royal families claimed descent from Odin through other sons. For traditions about Odin's offspring see Sons of Odin.<br>
<br>
Anglo-Saxon Woden<br>
The Anglo-Saxon tribes brought Woden to England around the 5th and 6th centuries, continuing his worship until conversion to Christianity in the 8th and 9th centuries. Woden is the carrier-off of the dead, but not necessarily with the attributes of Norse Odin. Woden is also the leader of the Wild Hunt. The familial relationships are the same between Woden and the other Anglo-saxon gods as they are for the Norse.<br>
<br>
According to the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle and the Historia Britonum, Woden had the sons Wecta, Baeldaeg, Casere and Wihtlaeg.<br>
    * Wecta's line is continued by Witta, Wihtgils, Hengest and Horsa, and the Kings of Kent.<br>
    * Baeldaeg's line is continued by Brona, Frithugar, Freawine, Wig, Gewis, Esla, Elesa, Cerdic and the Kings of Wessex.<br>
    * Casere's line is continued by Tytmon, Trygils, Hrothmund, Hryp, Wilhelm, Wehha, Wuffa and the Kings of East Anglia.<br>
    * Wihtlaeg's line is continued by Wermund king of Angel, Offa, Angeltheow, Eomer, Icel and the Kings of Mercia.<br>
<br>
Anglo-Saxon literature starts at about the time of the conversion from the old religion. Although whatever stories recording his part in the lives of men and the gods are lost, Woden's name survived in many settlement names and geographical features.<br>
    * Wansdyke - Woden's embankment<br>
    * Grimsdyke - From Grim, "hooded" a description of his appearance<br>
    * Wednesbury - Woden's burgh<br>
