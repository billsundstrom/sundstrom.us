Later they moved to Fergus Falls, then to La Crosse, Wis., and in the summer of 1912 came to this city.  They purchased the Saint Peter Woolen Mills, which they have since operated.  Mrs. Brinker assisted materially in the establishment of their lucrative business here and was a capable business woman.<br>
During her residence here, she was an active member of the M. E. church and of the Ladies' Aid. Fraternally, she was a member of the Hazel Rebekah Lodge No. 31, I.O.O.F., of Fergus Falls.
