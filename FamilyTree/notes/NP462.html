During World War II while Gayle was serving overseas, Carol and her cousin Lillis Light lived together in Beatrice, Nebraska and later moved to Fairbury.

She was so proud to be able to attend Nebraska Cornhusker football games in Lincoln with her husband, grandchildren and friends.  Both Carol and Gayle enjoyed Nebraska football very much, and in the last few years, Carol enjoyed following the Nebraska Girls Volleyball team as well.  She was an avid Nebraska Cornhusker fan!  Red was one of her favorite colors.<br>
After her husband Gayle passed away, Carol moved to North Platte, Nebraska in 1994 where her daughter Karen lived.  As she joined the North Platte community, she became involved with the Hospital Auxiliary at Great Plains Regional Medical Center and volunteered at the Hospital Gift Shop, as well as participating in the Foster Grandparent program with the North Platte public schools.  She later moved back to Fairbury for a short period of time, and then moved to Lincoln where she lived with her daughter Karen and Jim.  She enjoyed several years in Lincoln with family and friends.<br>
