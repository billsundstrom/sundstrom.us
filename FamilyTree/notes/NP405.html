Ingegerd OLOFSDOTTER
<p>
<a name ="I005540"><b>[I005540]</b></a><br />
Ingegerd Olofsdotter, born 1001 in Sigtuna, Sweden, was the daughter of Swedish King Olof Skötkonung. She was engaged to be married to Norwegian King Olaf II, but when Sweden and Norway got into a feud, Swedish King Olof Skötkonung wouldn't allow for the marriage to happen.<br>
<br>
Instead, her father quickly arranged with a marriage to the powerful Yaroslav I the Wise of Novgorod. Once in Russia, her name was changed to the Greek Irene. According to several sagas, she was given as a marriage gift Ladoga and adjacent lands, which later received the name Ingria (arguably a corruption of Ingigerd's name).<br>
<br>
She initiated the building of the Saint Sophia Cathedral in Kiev that was supervised by her husband, who styled himself czar. They had six sons and four daughters, which became Queens of France, Hungary, Norway, and (arguably) England. The whole family is depicted in one of the frescoes of the Saint Sophia. Upon her death on 10 Feb. 1049, she was buried in the same cathedral.<br>
<br>
Ingigerd-Irene is sometimes confused with Yaroslav's first wife, whose name was Anna. She was declared a local saint in Novgorod because of her initiative of building the Cathedral of St Sophia in Novgorod, where she is buried.<br>

Styrbjörn OLOFSSON
<p>
<a name ="I005571"><b>[I005571]</b></a><br />
From Wikipedia<br>
<br>
Styrbjörn the Strong (Styrbjörn Sterki) or Styrbjörn the Swedish Champion (Styrbjörn svı́a kappi) was according to the Norse sagas the son of Olof (II) Björnsson, and the nephew of Eric the Victorious. At his father's death, ca 980, Björn could claim greater right to the throne of Sweden than Eric's own soon to be born son.<br>
<br>
The earliest attestation of Styrbjörn is from a contemporary scaldic poem a lausavı́sa[1] 1. It is believed that there once was a larger saga on Styrbjörn, but most of what is extant is found in the short story Styrbjarnar áttr Svı́akappa. Parts of his story are also retold in Eyrbyggja saga and in Hervarar saga. He is moreover mentioned in Yngvars saga vı́đförla where Ingvar the Far-Travelled is compared to his kinsman Styrbjörn.<br>
<br>
The following synopsis is based on Styrbjarnar áttr Svı́akappa:<br>
<br>
Youth<br>
Styrbjörn was unusually big, strong and unruly (for a Viking) and although he was only a little boy he managed to kill a courtier who accidentally had hit him on the nose with a drinking horn.<br>
<br>
When he was 12 years old he asked his uncle for his birthright, but when he was denied the co-rulership of Sweden he sulked for a long time on his father's mound.<br>
<br>
When he was 16 the Ting decided that he was too unruly to be king of Sweden. Eric decided to make his own unborn child co-regent on the condition that it was a son. As a compensation his uncle Eric gave him 60 well-equipped longships whereupon the frustrated Styrbjörn took his sister Gyrid and left.<br>
<br>
Career<br>
He ravaged the shores of the Baltic Sea and when he was twenty, he conquered the stronghold of Jomsborg from its founder Palnetoke, and became the ruler of the Jomsvikings.<br>
<br>
After some time he allied with the Danish king Harold Bluetooth and married his sister Gyrid to him. Styrbjörn married Harold's daughter Tyra, whom he was given by Harold for conquering Jomsborg. (Styrbjörn had the son Torkel Styrbjörnsson with Tyra. Torkel had a daughter named Gytha Thorkelsdóttir, who married Godwin, Earl of Wessex and became the mother of Harold II of England).<br>
<br>
The Battle of the Fyris Wolds<br>
Harold gave him even more warriors and now Styrbjörn was about to reclaim the throne of Sweden. He sailed with a huge force which included 200 Danish longships in addition to his own Jomsvikings. When they arrived at Föret (Old Norse: Fyris) in Uplandia he burnt the ships in order to force his men to fight to the end. The Danish force changed its mind and returned to Denmark.<br>
<br>
Styrbjörn marched alone with his Jomsvikings to Gamla Uppsala. His uncle was, however, prepared and had sent for reinforcements in all directions.<br>
<br>
During the first two days, the battle was even. In the evening, Eric went to the statue of Odin at the Temple at Uppsala where he sacrificed. He promised Odin that if he won the battle, he would belong to Odin and arrive at Valhalla in ten years from then.<br>
<br>
The third day, Eric threw his spear over the enemy and said "I sacrifice you all to Odin". The Swedes were winning, and the Danish warriors fled. Only Styrbjörn and his sworn men stayed, and died.<br>

Evelyn OLSON
<p>
<a name ="I054361"><b>[I054361]</b></a><br />
Evelyn Lundberg , Bismarck, passed away on Oct. 18, 2010, after a two-week hospital stay while visiting family in Shakopee, Minn.<br>
She was born May 1, 1920, in Bismarck, to Peter and Mable Nordstrom Olson and at a couple weeks of age, moved to Maywood, a suburb of Chicago, where she lived until age 24. She suffered from ill health throughout her life, beginning with childhood illnesses including diphtheria and small pox. Despite these setbacks, she thrived in Chicago pursuing many careers, including working for Warner Brothers. She returned to North Dakota, where she met her husband, Robert "Bud" Lundberg . Her brothers teased her that she would marry someone whose land joined theirs, which turned out to be a fact.<br>
They were married Jan. 13, 1944, in Oklahoma City, Okla., and subsequently lived in Palo Alto, Calif., where Bud served as a Navy Air Corp Pilot, later in the Pacific. After the war, Bud became principal at Wilton High School. They then farmed for the first time in either of their lives on their family land near Regan. Evelyn learned how to cook for hired men as well as carry water from the well - a far cry from her Chicago upbringing. They worked as an equal team. During this time, they had two daughters, Susan and Stephanie. In order to start a new chapter in their lives with their daughters, Bud returned to college to receive his law degree. During this time, Evelyn studied vocals and art at the University of North Dakota. Love of the arts was threaded throughout her life and passed on to her entire family. As a visual artist, her paintings are found around North Dakota and the world. Her passion is shown every year in Sleepy Hollow Summer Theatre, a cultural entity she and her family created.<br>
As Bud practiced law, Evelyn enjoyed being part of the Bismarck arts community while raising their daughters. Evelyn took care of her entire family, immediate and extended. While Bud was a prominent lawyer, he always stated he "only brought in the money and Evelyn did everything else." She created the harmony, loyalty and instructions that lead her family to this day.<br>
Evelyn and her family received the Bismarck Art and Galleries Association Honor Citation Award, the only family ever so recognized. Evelyn and her girls were also recognized with the Dakota Adventist Light Award, Folkfest Volunteer Award and the Daughters of the American Revolution Award. As a founder and practicing artist of Gallery 522, her creations were featured in several exhibits. Also involved since the early days of the Bismarck Art Association in the 1950s, she, her daughters and granddaughter, Melissa, more recently mounted two major exhibits entitled "Threads of Scandinavian Heritage I and II."<br>
She led by example. Evelyn "Nana" steered her family with straight honesty, fearless drive, energy and creativity. Even near the end, her will and wits never diminished. She believed kindness is imperative, caring a responsibility and giving a privilege. She often entered arenas where angels feared to tread. Her courage and strength protected and supported. Evelyn was elegant, both in style and personality.<br>
The matriarch of her family, her productive life included mentoring not only her daughters and friends, but also her lovingly self-adopted daughters, Jill Johnson-Sholts, Michelle Lenzmeier-Keates and Debbie Reiter. When she raised her family, it was with total commitment of training, expecting her daughters and others to be responsible, kind and inclusive.<br>
Married for 53 years, Bud passed away in 1997. She is survived by daughters, Susan Lundberg and Stephanie and her husband, Bill Delmore; grandchildren, Melissa and her husband, Bryan McGowan and great-grandsons, Jordan and Harrison; and Shane and his wife, Erin Delmore; Cole Delmore, children: Grayson and Estella; brother, Edwin and his wife, Marge Olson and daughters, Pamela and her husband, Steve James and children, Sean and Eric; Debra and her husband, Jeff and children, Krystal and Nicolas; sister-in-law, Audrey Olson and sons, Peter and his wife, Carla, children, Steven and Jacqueline; Roderic and his wife, LeAnn, daughters, Danielle and Nicole and Matthew and his wife, Terri and sons, Lukas and Logan.<br>
A celebration of her life will be held at 1:30 p.m. Sunday, Oct. 24, at Trinity Lutheran Church, Bismarck, with a reception following at the Trinity Community Center.<br>
As a founder of Sleepy Hollow Summer Theatre, Evelyn would wish for memorials to be directed to Sleepy Hollow, P.O. Box 675, Bismarck, N.D. 58502, in lieu of flowers.<br>
