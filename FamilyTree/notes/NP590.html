Her first husband was William Welton by whom she has six children, three boys, Wallace, Samuel and Walter and three daughters, Mrs. Harding Spinney, Mrs. J.R. Woodbury and Mrs. Pitman. By the second marriage there was one daughter, Mrs. Richardson who resides in the States. Mrs. Spinney lived to see her great great grandchildren of whom there are two. She had 44 great grandchildren and 32 grandchildren. During her life she was an energetic worker and most careful housekeeper. Visitors at her home were always treated with the greatest hospitality. She was a conscientious christian woman and a life long member of the lower Aylesford Baptist church. The funeral services were conducted at the house and the remains interred in the cemetery at Tremont. Much sympathy is felt for Mr. Spinney, whose health is in a very precarious condition.<br>
