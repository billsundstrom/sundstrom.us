Burr Edward CARTWRIGHT
<p>
<a name ="I025005"><b>[I025005]</b></a><br />
First wife: Sopia S. Rouse - wed 2 NOV 1874 in Gaines, Kent, MI<br>
Father:     Edward Cartwright<br>
Mother:    Almira Hotchkiss<br>
<br>
Burr E. Cartwright is a native of Buffalo, N. Y., born October 26, 1850. a son of Edward and Elmira (Hotchkiss) Cartwright, residents of near Buffalo, former a native of Wales, and latter of Connecticut. The subject of our sketch attended the common schools until fifteen years of age, at which time he entered the Hethcote school, where he remained until his nineteenth year. The first commercial experience of Mr. Cartwright was in the lumber business in Buffalo, when, in 1879, he removed to Ridgway, Elk Co., Penn., as purchasing agent, in the lumber trade, for the firm of Scatchard & Son, in whose employ he remained until 1881. In that year he and W. W. Mattison formed a partnership in the lumber business, which organization resolved itself, in 1883, into the Ridgway Lumber Company, the several members thereof being Burr E. Cartwright, D. C. Oyster, Alfred Short and W. W. Mattison. In the fall of 1885 Mr. Mattison retired from the firm, W. H. Horton taking his place. In the following year Mr. Cartwright and Mr. Horton withdrew from the Ridgway Lumber Company, and entered into a co-partnership in contracting with the Northwestern Mining & Exchange Company, to cut the lumber and peel the bark on 8,000 acres. In 1888 Mr. Cartwright purchased Mr. Horton's interest in this enterprise, keeping, however, intact the former contract, made under the firm name of Horton & Cartwright. In order to fulfill this contract. Mr. Cartwright has in operation three saw-mills, having a capacity of 200,000 feet per day. He also operates a shingle and planing-mill at Horton City, a place located near the Mead Run school-house, and in the carrying on of the enormous business, 500 men are constantly employed. He has, in all, seventeen miles of standard-gauge railroad in operation, equipped with five locomotives and fifty logging cars. In the spring of 1889, Mr. Cartwright completed a contract with the Northwestern Mining & Exchange Company, for the building of one hundred dwellings at Mead Run. He owns and carries on two general stores, doing an aggregate business of $15,000 per month - one store being located at Horton City for the convenience of his own men, the other, an outside enterprise, being at Mead Run. The Horton City saw-mills are, perhaps, the best equipped mills in the eastern part of Pennsylvania, being provided with circular and gang saws; lath mills are attached, with the latest improved labor-saving appliances, the whole being lighted by electricity. The daily shipments of bark and lumber from the several stations along Mr. Cartwright's line, amount to twenty-five cars. Thus, in his management of his gigantic lumber and bark interests and contracts, together with the necessary saw-mills, adjuncts and appointments; in the conducting of his mammoth stores, and the directing of his army of employees, it may be said of Mr. Burr E. Cartwright, that he stands in the front rank among the lumbermen of Pennsylvania, and, perhaps, of the entire Union.<br>
<br>
In addition to the above-mentioned enterprises, Mr. Cartwright has, since the writing of this sketch, organized the Brock Coal Company (capital $50,000), of which he is president. It is their intention to fully equip these mines (which are located at Brockwayville, Jefferson Co., Penn.) with electrical mining machinery, and they expect to have a daily output of 1,000 tons. They will commence shipping coal about May 1, 1890.<br>
<br>
In 1874 Mr. Cartwright was married to Miss Sophia Rouse, of Gaines, Mich., who survived her wedding but ten months, and one son was born to them, Morgan Rouse, now attending Deveaux College, Suspension Bridge, N. Y. In 1877 Mr. Cartwright took for his second wife Miss Alice Jane Higham, who has borne him one daughter: Orrel Higham. Mrs. Cartwright attends the Congregational Church. Mr. Cartwright, who is one of the most active workers in the Republican party, served three years as chairman of the Republican county committee; in the fall of 1888 be was named as the choice of Elk county for congress, and at the congressional conference held at DuBois he was tendered the nomination, but owing to his vast business engagements, the constituency had, reluctantly, to accept his refusal. He is a member of the F. & A. M., Elk Lodge, No. 379; of Elk Chapter, No. 230, R. A. M.; of Knapp Commandery, No. 40, K. T., and of Bloomsburg Consistory.<br>

''Such wonderful memories . . . sail on, dear friend, on angel wings to the heart of paradise of God's wondrous world.'' <br>
These thoughts are from a eulogy for Lewis Cass - an international photojournalist for 55 years. He was one of the pioneers in the newsreel motion picture industry worldwide, both in sound and cinematography. <br>

He was on tour during Franklin D. Roosevelt's entire campaign as his personal photographer. When asked what type of president Roosevelt was, he responded, ''Just a down-to-earth man who made you feel at ease at all times.'' <br>
During World War II, Cass was on the front line photographing the war. <br>
His first assignment was in 1928 at a radio station in New York. He headed a crew on the first church service broadcast, and one of his favorite assignments was a weekly radio broadcast of Rudy Vallee from the famous High-Ho Club in New York. <br>
His wife described him this way: ''Lew brings to mind the sweetest memories, taking pictures and recording things. We will think of him fondly forevermore.'' <br>
