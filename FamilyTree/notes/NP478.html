<h2>Notes</h2>
Donald Dean SCHNEPF
<p>
<a name ="I083820"><b>[I083820]</b></a><br />
Donald D. Schnepf, age 84, of Rock Rapids, IA, passed away peacefully on Thursday, October 15, 2009, at the Rock Rapids Health Centre after a long illness. Funeral services were held Friday, October 23, 2009, at the Immanuel Lutheran Church in Rock Rapids, with burial at the Riverview Cemetery of Rock Rapids.<br>
<br>
Donald D. Schnepf was born on November 18, 1924, on a farm in Logan Township, Lyon County, Iowa, the second son of Frederick and Esther (Oldenburg) Schnepf. He was baptized and confirmed at the Christ Lutheran Church in Alvord, IA. He attended country school and graduated from Lester High School. He studied two years at the University of South Dakota, and then transferred to the University of Iowa, where he graduated in 1946 with a degree in Business Administration. He was united in marriage to Marian Borman on September 11, 1949.<br>
<br>
Don worked for the Rock Rapids State Bank as cashier for 13 years. He continued in business and became a partner in the Dirks & Oldenburg Insurance Agency in Rock Rapids, which eventually became the Oldenburg-Schnepf Agency, and ultimately the Schnepf & Miller Agency. He remained in the insurance and real estate business for over 28 years until he retired in 1990.<br>
<br>
Don was very active in the Rock Rapids community where he was a long-time member of Immanuel Lutheran Church. He was active in his childrenʼs lives serving as Cub Scout Master for several years and helping out with the Boy Scout Troop. Over the years, he also served as president of the Rock Rapids Jaycees, state vice president of the Iowa Jaycees, president of Kiwanis, board member of the Community Affairs Committee, president of Merrill Pioneer Hospital Board of Directors, chairman of the local Salvation Army for Lyon County for many years, president of Rock River Golf Club Board of Directors, as well as master of the local Masonic Lodge where he was a member for over 50 years.<br>
Throughout his life, Don enjoyed bowling, fishing, hunting, golfing, and wood-working, as well as watching his favorite Chicago "Cubbies" play ball! Don was very much a "people person." He particularly enjoyed young children and would always have a wink and a grin for them. But his three granddaughters were certainly the apple of his eye!<br>
He is survived by his beloved wife of 60 years, Marian Schnepf, of Rock Rapids; two sons, Randall (Anita) Schnepf of McLean, VA and Paul (Lori) Schnepf of Inver Grove Heights, MN; daughter Nancy (Joseph) Stein of Plymouth, MN; and three grandchildren, Neesha Schnepf of Ithaca, NY; Rekha Schnepf of McLean, VA; and Mikayla Stein of Plymouth, MN; brothers Eugene (Ann) Schnepf of Rock Rapids and Gerald (Pat) Schnepf of Des Moines, IA; and sister, Elinor (Charles) Ward of Longmont, CO; and many nieces, nephews, relatives and friends.<br>
Don was preceded in death by his parents; one brother, James Schnepf, and his wife, Mary Ann; and sister-in-law Jackie Schnepf.<br>

Posting from Joan <br>
My home is Camano Island in Washington State.  My husband and I have cherished living on Camano for the past twenty five years.  This is where we enjoy beaches, water and breathtaking views of the Cascade Mountain Range.   Happily, outdoor spaces are still abundant throughout the Pacific Northwest.<br>
  I feel fortunate to have art in my life.  While painting early on, my medium was strictly oil.  Later I moved to pastels.  When I began working in watercolor I knew I had found my great love.  I've been working with watercolor for over thirty years and have never lost my passion for it.  At present, nevertheless, I am thrilled to add acrylic to my list of mediums.  My recent enthusiasm for acrylic has, in turn, given inspiration to exploring new painting surfaces.   I enjoy pairing acrylic with board, built-up canvas and textured paper.<br>
 My work is the culmination of years spent walking and observing landscapes and seascapes which are both central to my life and close to my heart.  I study carefully significant details both large and small within these natural areas.  Then finally I apply my gathered perceptions; my "visual attitudes" to my craft.   So I paint, I experiment, I paint again.  Life is never sunnier when, in the end, a successful painting is achieved, I feel as though I've won a prize.  It is such a high.......<br>

On a March night in 1944 on a beachhead in Anzio, Italy, 19-year-old James Donald Schofield was shot by German bullets.<br>
I know about him only because I came across his name, and the circumstances of that night while digging for a Remembrance Day story for one of the long-term care clients I write for, Schlegel Villages. <br>
Douglas Martin is a resident at the Village of Humber Heights in Etobikoke and he was there that night, struggling along with Schofield as he clung to life. Today, Martin's vision is all but faded and his memory is much the same, but his wife, Elsie, says when it comes to the war and that March night in 1944, his memory is clear. <br>
Martin was a member of the 1st Special Service Force, known as the Devilʼs Brigade. It was a joint Canadian-American commando unit organized in 1942 and disbanded in December, 1944.<br>
He was on a night patrol along that beachhead when he came under enemy fire. As he lay in a drainage ditch beside the road, a groaning soldier clutching his stomach stumbled into the ditch beside him.<br>
"I recognized him as J.D. Schofield," Martin told his daughter in a dictated statement -- he wanted the story recorded with hope that if it was shared through the veterans' newsletters, he might one day put his regrets to rest.<br>
"We held onto each other as I proceeded to lead him to our own lines," his story continues. "He was a heavy man and after a short walk we had to stop."<br>
With the help of fellow soldiers, Doug managed to get the wounded Schofield to an Italian farmhouse relatively safe from danger where he was placed in a chair so his wounds could be disinfected.<br>
He was later shipped to hospital but, sadly, word returned that his wounds were too great and Schofield never made it through the night.<br>
Martin's regret is that upon his return to Canada, and in the 63 years since that night, he never contacted Schofieldʼs parents to tell them his story. <br>
"The only thing I could have said to them was that I was with your son on the night he was fatally wounded."<br>
I spoke with Elsie Martin after reading his dictated version of that terrible night. She was happy to have me write about it.<br>
After the story was published on the site I couldn't get the name J.D. Schofield out of my head.<br>
I searched through the archives online for a while and found that Private James Douglas Schofield, a member of the Canadian Special Service Battalion, R.C.I.C., died in Italy on March 13, 1944.<br>
He was from Cambridge Station, Nova Scotia, and his parents, Gilbert and A. May Schofield, must've been devastated to outlive their son.<br>
As it stands, I've made the legion in Kentville, just down the road from what J.D. Schofield left behind went he left to fight in Europe, aware of Doug Martin's story. <br>
Schofield is a common enough name in that part of the country, but if there is any family left hopefully we can track them down. They may be nephews or nieces, but I'd hope they appreciate what Doug Martin has carried over these past six decades. <br>
I was touched by the story and I know I won't forget it.<br>
For all the J.D. Schofields and Douglas Martins, my heart is filled with gratitude.<br>
Peace.<br>

Kings County's Oldest Resident Celebrates 103rd Christmas<br>
Kings County's oldest living resident, Mrs. Olivia Woodworth Barkhouse, who will be 104 years of age next February 4th, celebrated her 103rd Christmas Day quietly with her son and daughter-in-law, Mr. and Mrs. Wylie Woodworth, at Hillaton.<br>
All her life Mrs. Barkhouse has resided within a radius of ten miles of Halls Harbor, where she was born February 4, 1837. Christmas in her girlhood days was spent at Halls Harbor and in the early days of her married life on a North Mountain farm, and in her middle age and later years in the Canards.<br>
Mrs. Barkhouse is the daughter of Mr. and Mrs. Samuel Schofield and is a descendant of pioneer English settlers in both the United States and Canada. Her grandparents came to Nova Scotia with the New England Planters in 1760 and settled first in Canard, later removing to the Fundy Shore.<br>
Though Mrs. Barkhouse's health is not quite as good as when she celebrated her 100th birthday, nevertheless she is able to be up and around most of the time, and continues various activities.<br>
With her eyesight and hearing fairly good, considering her remarkable age, Mrs. Barkhouse delights in recalling the events of earlier days as she braids and hooks mats with surprising skill. Her memory is excellent, and one of her favorite topics is the early shipping days of this province.<br>
Married twice, her first husband was Rodman Woodworth, whom she married in February, 1859. He died many years ago. By this union there were eight children, six of whom are still living: Three sons, Clifford Woodworth, Coldbrook; Ernest Woodworth, Malden, Mass; Wylie Woodworth, Hillaton; and three daughters, Mrs. B. J. Brance and Mrs. A. N. Dickie, Marsfield, Mass.? and Mrs. Palmer Schultz, Norwell, Mass. She also has twenty-nine grandchildren, and equal number of great-grandchildren and several great-great-grandchildren.<br>
Her second husband was Edmund Barkhouse, who died five years ago, shortly after his 100th birthday. Wolfville Acadian.<br>

<a name ="I028463"><b>[I028463]</b></a><br />
We are pleased to feature Vera Schofield in the Winter Edition of the Newsletter. Vera hails from Nova Scotia but can hardly be called a CFA in that she came to the Province in 1963 and has children and grandchildren living in the Province. Vera is a Registered Nurse and has worked in the health care field. She retired in 1997 after working at Hoyles Home in St. Johnʼs for 16 years.<br>
Vera is just as active now as she was when she was working and raising four children. She has just retired from a three-year appointment by the Anglican Bishop as the Lay Director of the Cursillo Program for the Eastern Region of the Province. Cursillo is a world-wide organization (there is a National Office in Toronto). The Program offers a three-day course in Christian living, which is available yearly in November and is open to any baptized person. Vera can be reached at vschofield@@nl.rogers.com if you would like more information. <br>
Vera Schofield is very active with St. Thomasʼs Anglican Church and is a pastoral/Eucharistic Lay Minister serving the Miller Centre and Escasoni residents. Veraʼs volunteer work also includes driving cancer patients to their appointments. For fun Vera plays Bridge with great skill and enthusiasm when she gets a chance. She tries to keep fit and is an avid walker and cyclist. She works out at a gym in the winter and confessed that she wants to participate in the Tely 10 next summer "not to compete but just do it". I bet she will! Vera has four children and six grandchildren; two children and four grandchildren live in the province so she spends a lot of time babysitting and doing granny things like picking the children up from school. Robyn is the family dog and requires a lot of attention now that she is aging. We wish Vera Schofield good heath and happiness in her retirement.  <br>

Wilfred Borden SCHOFIELD
<p>
<a name ="I022057"><b>[I022057]</b></a><br />
Dr. Wilfred Borden Schofield 81, beloved father of Linda, Muriel, and Pamela, and grandfather to Aisha, Elise, Shayden and Kai, passed away peacefully in the early morning of November 5, 2008 at Marion Hospice in Vancouver, following a brief battle with cancer. Wilf (b. Brooklyn Corner, NS, 1927) attended Acadia University with the aim of becoming a certified school teacher, but his passion for mosses led him into graduate work. He attended Stanford University (1954-56) for his MSc, where he met the love of his life, Margaret Irene (nee Bledsoe; d. 2005), through mutual friends. Peggy was completing her Masters in piano, and Wilf shared her love of classical music. They were engaged to be married after a one-month courtship. Their honeymoon in the Arctic, where Wilf conducted field research, produced many fond memories. A doctoral degree from Duke University followed in 1960, and that year he joined the faculty of the botany department at UBC. As an emeritus professor, up to the month before his passing, he was actively conducting research, writing scholarly texts, teaching and mentoring. His research took him to numerous places around the world, including New Zealand, Japan, Australia and Tasmania. Field work conducted in Alaska over the last 15 summers will provide data for a book on the Aleutian moss flora. The text will be completed posthumously through the generosity of friends and colleagues. Over the years, a number of mosses, other non-vascular plants, and one flowering plant have been described in his honour. Wilf's greatest joy was sharing his enthusiasm for bryophytes. He loved, in almost equal measure, literature, classical music, art, and a good cup of tea. In addition to countless colleagues and former students, he will be greatly missed by his daughters, grandchildren, sister Vera, brother-in-law Turner, nieces, nephews, cousins, and extended family. A memorial to celebrate his life will be held in the spring. Details will be announced soon on www.caringbridge.org/visit/wilfschofield Published in the Vancouver Sun and The Province, 14 November 2008<br>

UBC Department of Botany Newsletter, No.4<br>
----------------------------------<br>
It is with great sadness that we mark the passing of Canadaʼs leading, and most celebrated bryologist, Professor Emeritus Wilfred Borden Schofield. Wilf passed away on November 5, 2008, having succumbed to cancer. He was 81.<br>
Wilf was born in Brooklyn Corner, Nova Scotia on July 19, 1927. He attended Acadia University from 1946-50 where he earned a B.A. with the intention of becoming a school teacher. However, his love of plants, nurtured through the mentorship of Chalmers Smith and J.S. Erskine, led him to pursue postgraduate studies that included work in both bryology (taxonomy) and vascular plants (ecology). Acadia University later bestowed upon him an Honorary Doctorate of Science in recognition of his lifelong contributions to botany (1990).<br>
Wilf completed his M.A. at Stanford University in 1956 under the direction of W.C. Steere, a well known American bryologist, who eventually became the Director of the New York Botanic Garden. His thesis was a taxonomic work on a difficult genus entitled "The relationships and Geographic Distribution of Canadian and Alaskan species of Hypnum". Wilfʼs lifelong interest in this genus eventually resulted in the publication of a North American revision for the Bryophyte Flora of North America (http://www.efloras.org/florataxon.aspx?flora_id=50&taxon_id=116204). During his time at Stanford, Wilf worked with another well known bryologist, Howard Crum, who was the Curator of Cryptogams at the National Museum in Ottawa at the time. Wilf spent two field seasons (1955-56) with Crum collecting bryophytes in the Rocky Mountains, from Waterton Lakes to the Yukon Territory.<br>
It was while he was at Stanford that Wilf met his future bride, Margaret (Peggy) Irene (nee Bledsoe; d. 2005). After a short courtship, they were married in 1956. Soon after completing his M.A. (and for Peggy, her M.A. in Music), they moved to North Carolina, where Wilf began Ph.D. studies with the plant ecologist, H.J. Oosting, at Duke University. This time, it was an ecological thesis, entitled "The Ecotone between Spruce Fir and Deciduous Forest in the Great Smoky Mountains". Wilf graduated in 1960, and soon after he and Peggy moved to Vancouver, British Columbia where Wilf had accepted a position as a faculty member with the Department of Botany at the University of British Columbia.<br>
Before they moved west, friends warned Wilf, "Donʼt go there all the weird ones move west". I donʼt think Wilf was ever considered "weird", but it was in British Columbia that he fuelled his passion for bryophytes and began a long, outstanding career as the foremost bryologist in Canada. He retired in 1992 but was appointed Professor Emeritus shortly thereafter.<br>
Wilfʼs interests were mainly phytogeographic, at least in the early and middle years, when he published many papers on the floristics and distribution of bryophytes in British Columbia. Among the more important works is a contribution to a volume on the Queen Charlotte Islands. The chapter, entitled "Structure and affinities of the bryoflora of the Queen Charlotte Islands" was the culmination of 35 years of field work on the islands.<br>
In his later years, Wilf contributed numerous taxonomic papers on the genera Hypnum, Taxithelium, Brotherella, and the family Sematophyllaceae, among others. In addition he contributed extensively to the Bryophyte flora of North America: Takakiaceae, Buxbaumiaceae, Hypnum, Buxbaumiaceae, Diphysciaceae, Disceliaceae, Dicranoweisia, and Rhabdoweisia.<br>
His publications reflect Wilfʼs diverse interests and his adeptness as a botanist. Although he specialized in mosses and liverworts, he also published at least eight papers on lichens and vascular plants.<br>
In addition to peer reviewed articles, Wilfʼs publications include chapters in four plant textbooks (An Evolutionary Survey of the Plant Kingdom, Plant Diversity: An Evolutionary Approach, Nonvascular Plants: An Evolutionary Survey, Plants: An Evolutionary Survey), an introductory bryophyte textbook (Introduction to Bryology), as well as numerous field handbooks.<br>
Wilf taught courses in Phytogeography, Bryology, and "Ferns and Allies". As a teacher he was tireless. He devoted considerable energy updating his notes, which he did yearly. In the bryology and ferns course he used fresh material as much as possible, which he often collected the day of the lab or the day before. Sometimes he would do so by walking through the Pacific Spirit Park on his way to work.<br>
The introductory bryophyte textbook gained some notoriety. The book arose as a result of the bryology course, and is an expansion of his notes for that course. It was published in 1986 and earned several accolades: "Excellence in book design and production" by the Association of American Publishers, and the George Lawson Medal for 1986 for the same book Introduction to Bryology by the Canadian Botanical Association for "single contribution to botanical knowledge of outstanding distinction."<br>
Wilf had a deep love of field work which lasted to the end of his life: he had spent the summer in Alaska before his passing later that fall. He believed that to truly understand and know the bryophytes, one had to see and study them in their natural habitat. It was only in this way that one could learn the habitats and microhabitat requirement of individual species and understand their morphological diversity. His direct and extensive experience with bryophytes in the field was reflected not only in his works, but also in his reputation: he was considered by colleagues, students, and acquaintances to be a wealth of botanical knowledge and was frequently sought after for advice and information.<br>
There were very few years in which Wilf did not spend a summer in the field. Most of his field work was in British Columbia. He was particularly fond of the Queen Charlotte Islands, where he conducted field work over 35 years. He also spent many seasons along the coast and worked five summers in the Atlantic Provinces. During the last 15 years of his life however, summers were spent collecting in the Aleutian Islands. The latter work will culminate in a moss flora of the Aleutians, one which is nearly complete. It will be finished posthumously.<br>
Wilf was an avid plant collector. Some referred to him as a 'garbage bagger' in reference to the volumes of material that he amassed during field trips. But there was a reason for this ʻmadnessʼ. Wilf felt strongly that if one was to collect for science, then it was important to obtain good material, and enough material for duplicates. As a result, the bryophyte collection at UBC is second in size only to the National Museum in Ottawa (CANM) - all due to Wilfʼs assiduousness. On size of the CANM collection Wilf would remark that, "CANM is only bigger because I sent them so many duplicates!" In any case, there are many herbaria around the world that will never be able to repay their "exchangeʼ debt to UBC because of Wilfʼs hard work. Moreover, the "data" in the form of specimen vouchers that Wilf has contributed to bryology will always remain invaluable to our understanding of the distributions of bryophytes. His last collecting number was 128,619. It was a Bryum species collected from Umak Island, not long after the volcano erupted.<br>
The greatness of individuals is often measured by their accomplishments. While Wilfʼs accomplishments in bryology will be remembered and have influence on the science for many years, it will undoubtedly be the person himself that many of us will remember most. Wilf was a great person, a genuine, generous and welcoming person. On my first meeting with him, he ushered me into his office and immediately offered me a cup oʼ tea. We then chatted and discussed bryology, politics, books and many other topics. I later watched him welcome many others into his office, students, colleagues, professors. All were treated equally and with sincere hospitality. Wilf will be dearly missed. <br>
