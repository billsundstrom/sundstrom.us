<p>
<a name ="I001302"><b>[I001302]</b></a><br />
A lifetime pursuit came to fruition recently for singer/songwriter Scott "Sonny" Sundstrom of Alcester, S.D. The 43-year-old released his first CD, a collection of 18 original songs amassed over a 20-year music hobby.<br>
More is on the way.<br>
"Creative Collection," available now at Uncle John and Backstage with Ray, is the first of a three-volume set Sundstrom is production. Volumes II and III, he said, should be available next month.<br>
All told, there are 42 original songs in Sundstrom's collection. The musical styles vary from rock to country to blues and folk.<br>
"I sing and play keyboard on the CDs," said Sundstrom, who works in an office supply firm in Sioux Falls by day. "I've added other tracks like percussion and bass. Everything was done in the studio."<br>
Sundstrom's music passion was fed at an early age. The son of Burdette and Lois Sundstrom of Alcester grew up watching his mother sing at various church and community functions. Sonny was soon to follow. And for much of the past two decades he's been going from site to site around Siouxland offering his sound.<br>
"One of our bands that played a lot around Sioux City was called Full Circle," said Sundstrom. "I know we had two different two-year runs with that band. And there were others, or I'd just go myself to places around Sioux Falls and Sioux City. Over the years, I've done a lot of it."<br>
Sundstrom's first collection revolves around personal experiences. Titles are things like "Still a Family Man," "Four Generations," "Friends of Life," and a tribute to his daughter Julia, now 12, at the time of her birth.<br>
"I wrote 'Little One' right after she was born and it means a lot," said Sundstrom. "In fact, Julia's now getting into some music herself.<br>
"Each song has a special place," he added.<br>
Another "special place" of sorts is The Bread Basket at 1101 Fourth St., Sioux City, where Sundstrom performs at 8 p.m. Saturday. He'll follow on March 28 with another 8 p.m. show at the restaurant's new downtown location.<br>

The 1900 census lists a Johanna Sundstrom (57) as an inmate at the North Michigan Asylum, Grand Rapids, Traverse County.  Most of the information is not filled in.  Perhaps the census taker entered an incorrect age and this is our Johanna.<br>
