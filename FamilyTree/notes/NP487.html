Keiko SEKI
<p>
<a name ="I037356"><b>[I037356]</b></a><br />
BLOOMINGTON - Keiko Seki Hawkins, 54, Bloomington, passed away Dec. 17, 2008, at her home.<br>
After her passing, a private service was provided by her family. Now, as the flowers are starting to bloom, a celebration of life for family and friends will be at 11:30 a.m. Saturday at First Presbyterian Church, 2000 E. College Ave, Normal, at Keiko's request. The family will gather to receive friends immediately following the service. East Lawn Funeral Home in Bloomington handled cremation arrangements.<br>
Memorials may be made to the Japanese Saturday School through Sakura-kai Inc. (attn: Mr. Nakayama), Mistubishi Motorway, Normal, IL 61761 or to the American Cancer Society.<br>
Keiko was born Jan. 24, 1954, in Matsuyama, Ehime, Japan, daughter of Hiroshige and Chigusa Seki. On Oct. 10, 1982, in front of a small gathering of family and friends at the "Little Chapel of the Roses" in Bonita, Calif., she made her vows to Bruce Hawkins. They celebrated 26-plus years of marriage, residing in Madrid, Spain; Matsuyama, Japan; Buffalo, N.Y.; and then settling in Bloomington-Normal in June of 1987.<br>
Together they had three children, Ken Hawkins "Seki Kenji" of Bloomington; Tyson Hawkins "Seki Taizo" of Bloomington and Erika Hawkins "Seki Erikamari" of Savoy. Ken and Tyson are both actuaries, working in the Bloomington-Normal area. Ken works at Pinnacle Actuarial Associates and Tyson works at Country Financial. Erika will begin graduate studies in higher education administration in the fall.<br>
Keiko earned a bachelor's degree in history education from Japan Women's University in 1976. Her relationship with Bruce developed while she attended the Gemological Institute of America in Santa Monica, Calif., for studies in gemology. Later, she spent a summer at Middlebury College in Vermont for studies in Japanese language teaching.<br>
By spring of 1988, she found a professional home for herself in the Japanese Saturday School, which continues to meet at Metcalf School on the ISU campus. For Keiko, the Japanese Saturday School became more than just a place to work and a source of income, it became a way of maintaining significant personal and cultural connections with her homeland. This work also became a way that Keiko could help contribute significantly to internationalizing the local community. One of Keiko's proudest achievements came when she was promoted from teacher to principal of the Japanese Saturday School in 1999.<br>
Keiko was central in forming a group called Morokoshi kai, a social networking support group for Japanese women in international marriages throughout Central Illinois. In Japanese, the word "morokoshi" refers to corn, while an extended meaning of the word refers to things which, like corn, come from outside of Japan and China. With Central Illinois being the heart of corn country, and the women of the group having come to Central Illinois from Japan, "Morokoshi kai" seemed a perfect name for the group.<br>
Also very close to Keiko's heart was a group of women from Japan, Korea, China, Taiwan and the United States who got together frequently at the Hawkins' home to work on shadow boxes. With Keiko as their mentor, each member of the group worked on creating three-dimensional shadow boxes from prints and greeting cards through a meticulous process of creasing, cutting and pasting, layering images by stacking Styrofoam between them or building them up with drops of caulk. This group was not just a means of "arts and crafts" for the women, but a way to build relationships and common bonds.<br>
