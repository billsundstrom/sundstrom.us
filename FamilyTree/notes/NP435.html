JOSEPH POTTER DIES AT 88 YEARS<br>
After being bed-ridden for two long years with an attack of slow paralysis, Joseph Potter, one of the oldest pioneers of McLean County, died at the home of his daughter, Mrs. Nettie Spade, at 401 W. Beaufort St., Normal, at 3 o'clock yesterday morning.<br>
Joseph Potter was born on Christmas Day in the year 1833 [death cert shows 1834] on a farm in Ohio [death cert states Indiana] and lived there until he was about five years old. At that age he moved west with his parents and settled here at Bloomington, at that time a little cluster of frame buildings. While yet a young man he moved onto a farm near Secor and lived there for several years, but finally drifted back to Bloomington and made his home in Bloomington and Normal ever since that time.<br>
Mr. Potter was the head of four generations, he leaving several great grandchildren to mourn his loss. Among his surviving relatives there are four children, William Potter of Bloomington, Fred of Cloverdale, Mrs. Ella Dearth, and Mrs. Nettie Spade of Normal. He also leaves thirteen grandchildren and nine great grandchildren.<br>
Mr. Potter was indeed one of the oldest inhabitants of McLean County, having come here in 1838 and having spent his while life in or near Bloomington. When he first came here Bloomington could hardly be called a town, as it was surrounded by prairie, with here and there a corn field. He lived to see the little settlement grow to be one of the foremost cities in the state and to see the town of Normal born and grow to be one of the principal educational centers in the central west. He saw the county court house in its several stages change from a simple frame building to the stately structure it now is. Indeed, he was a pioneer.<br>
Joseph Potter was a man of fine character. As a young man he joined the Christian church and later taught Sunday school for some time. His children never heard him breath an oath and he never sore nor lied so far as his relatives knew. He was very kind to his family and paid much kindly attention to his children. He was devoted to his relatives and was always thought to be a model man.<br>
