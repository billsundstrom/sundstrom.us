Richard Bancroft BEAMAN
<p>
<a name ="I071972"><b>[I071972]</b></a><br />
Richard Bancroft Beaman, who was the Pittsburgh Center for the Arts' 1969 Artist of the Year and returned to Pittsburgh in 2000 for the 50th anniversary retrospective of the Artist of the Year exhibition, died July 23 in Rockport, Mass., where he'd lived since 1974. He was 94.<br>
A graduate of Phillips Exeter Academy, Harvard College and Union Theological Seminary, Mr. Beaman studied art at Harvard, Columbia Teachers College, the University of California, Berkeley and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. He joined the faculty of the University of Redlands, California, in 1939, where he taught until he accepted a position at Carnegie Mellon University in 1955.<br>
He retired from Carnegie Mellon, where he was the Andrew W. Mellon Professor of Arts, in 1974.<br>
A colleague from Carnegie Mellon, Ruth Strick, remembered him as "a true intellectual among artists. There was a lot of energy and excitement about him. He was always challenging and such fun -- a very serious artist. But he did not take himself seriously."<br>
Strick said Mr. Beaman was a painter who also created "some extraordinary glass work," at times as architectural commissions, using a fusing method that he'd developed.<br>
"There was a very powerful relationship between the glass work and his paintings," she said. "He translated from one to another with enormous ease."<br>
Mr. Beaman served as president of the Associated Artists of Pittsburgh and the Pittsburgh Plan for Art.<br>
He is survived by his wife, Jeanne; his children, Peter, Joanna, Valerie and Christina; and seven grandchildren.<br>

and for a brief moment its glory<br>
and beauty belong to our world<br>
But then it flies again<br>
and though we wish it could have stayed...<br>
We feel lucky to have seen it.<br>
