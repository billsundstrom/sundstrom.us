Isabella DE ANGOULÊME
<p>
<a name ="I005055"><b>[I005055]</b></a><br />
Isabella of Angouleme<br>
From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia.<br>
<br>
Isabella of Angouleme (c. 1187 - May 31, 1246) was countess of Angoulême and queen consort of England.<br>
<br>
She was the only daughter and heir of Aymer Taillefer, Count of Angoulême, by Alix de Courtney; her maternal great-grandfather was King Louis VI of France. She became Countess of Angoulême in her own right in 1202, by which time she was already queen of England. Her marriage to King John took place on August 24, 1200, at Bordeaux, a year after he annulled his first marriage. At the time of this marriage Isabella was aged about thirteen, and her beauty was renowned; she is sometimes called the "Helen" of the Middle Ages by historians.<br>

<br>
It could not be said to have been a successful marriage, as Isabella was much younger than her husband and had a fiery character to match his. Before their marriage, she had been betrothed to Hugh IX de Lusignan, Count of La Marche. As a result of John's temerity in taking her as his second wife, King Philip II of France confiscated all his French lands, and armed conflict ensued.<br>
<br>
When John died in 1216, Isabella was still in her twenties. She returned to France and in 1220 proceeded to marry Hugh X de Lusignan, Count de la March, the son of her former fiancé.<br>
<br>
Isabella was accused of plotting against the French king in 1244; she fled to Fontevrault Abbey, where she died on May 31, 1246, and was buried there. Afterwards most of her many children, having few prospects in France, set sail for England and the court of their half-brother King Henry.<br>
<br>
* With King John: 5 children, all of whom survived into adulthood, including:<br>
   1. the eldest, who became King Henry III of England on his father's death<br>
   2. Richard, Earl of Cornwall<br>
   3. Joan, the wife of King Alexander II of Scotland<br>
   4. Isabella, the wife of Emperor Frederick II<br>
   5. the youngest daughter, Eleanor, who would marry Simon de Montfort<br>
<br>
* With Hugh X of Lusignan, the Count de la March: 9 children, all of whom survived into adulthood, including:<br>
   1. Hugh XI of Lusignan, Count de la March and Count of Angoulême (1221-1260)<br>
   2. Aymer de Valence, Bishop of Winchester (1222-1260)<br>
   3. Agnés de Lusignan (1223-1269), married William II de Chauvigny<br>
   4. Alice de Lusignan (1224-1256), married John de Warenne, 7th Earl of Surrey<br>

Charles II DE ANJOU
<p>
<a name ="I008413"><b>[I008413]</b></a><br />
From Wikipedia<br>
<br>
Charles II, known as the Lame (Fr. le Boiteux) (born c. 1248, died 5 May 1309, Naples) was the King of Naples and Sicily, titular king of Jerusalem, and Prince of Salerno. He was a son of Charles I of Naples.<br>
<br>
He had been captured by Roger of Lauria in the naval battle at Naples in 1284. When his father died, he was still a prisoner of Peter III of Aragon.<br>
<br>
In 1288 King Edward Longshanks mediated to make peace, and Charles was liberated only to retain Naples alone. Sicily was left to the Aragonese. Charles was also to induce his cousin Charles of Valois to renounce for twenty thousand pounds of silver the kingdom of Aragon which given him by Pope Martin IV to punish Peter for having invaded Sicily, but which the Valois had never effectively occupied.<br>
<br>
Charles was then released, leaving three of his sons and sixty Provençal nobles as hostages, promising to pay 30,000 marks and to return a prisoner if the conditions were not fulfilled within three years. He went to Rieti, where the new Pope Nicholas IV, immediately absolved him from all the conditions he had sworn to observe, crowned him King of Sicily in 1289, and excommunicated King Alfonso III of Aragon. Charles of Valois, in alliance with Castile, prepared to take possession of Aragon. Alfonso, being hard pressed, had to promise to withdraw the troops he had sent to help his brother James in Sicily, to renounce all rights over the island, and pay a tribute to the Holy See.<br>
<br>
Alfonso died childless in 1291 before the treaty could be carried out, and James took possession of Aragon, leaving the government of Sicily to the third brother Frederick.<br>
<br>
The new Pope Boniface VIII, elected in 1294 at Naples under the auspices of King Charles, mediated between the latter and James, and a most dishonourable treaty was signed: James was to marry Charlesʼs daughter Bianca and was promised the investiture by the pope of Sardinia and Corsica, while he was to leave the Angevin a free hand in Sicily and even to assist him if the Sicilians resisted.<br>
<br>
An attempt was made to bribe Frederick into consenting to this arrangement, but being backed up by his people he refused, and was afterwards crowned king of Sicily. The ensuring war was fought on land and sea but Charles, though aided by the pope, his cousin Charles of Valois and James, was unable to conquer the island, and his son the prince of Taranto was taken prisoner at the battle of La Falconara in 1299. Peace was at last made in 1302 at Caltabellotta. Charles gave up all rights to Sicily and agreed to the marriage of his daughter Leonora and King Frederick; the treaty was ratified by the pope in 1303. Charles spent his last years quietly in Naples, which city he improved and embellished. He died in August 1309, and was succeeded by his son Robert the Wise.<br>
<br>
In 1270, he married Maria of Hungary (c. 1257 - March 25, 1323), the daughter of Stephen V of Hungary. They had fourteen children:<br>
   1. Charles Martel d'Anjou, titular King of Hungary<br>
   2. Louis (February 9, 1275, Nocera - August 19, 1298, Chateau de Brignoles), Bishop of Toulouse<br>
   3. Robert of Naples, King of Naples<br>
   4. Philip I of Taranto, Prince of Achaea and Taranto, Despot of Romania, Lord of Durazzo, titular Emperor of Constantinople<br>
   5. Raymond Berengar (1281-1307), Count of Provence, Prince of Piedmont and Andria<br>
   6. John (1283 - aft. March 16, 1308), a priest<br>
   7. Tristan (1284-bef. 1288)<br>
   8. Peter (1291 - August 29, 1315, Battle of Montecatini), Count of Gravina<br>
   9. John of Gravina (1294 - April 5, 1336, Naples), Duke of Durazzo, Prince of Achaea, and Count of Gravina, married March 1318 (div 1321) Matilda of Hainault (November 29, 1293-1336), married November 14, 1321 Agnes of Périgord (d. 1345)<br>
  10. Marguerite (1273- December 31, 1299), Countess of Anjou and Maine, married at Corbeil August 16, 1290 Charles of Valois<br>
  11. Blanca (1280 - October 14, 1310, Barcelona), married at Villebertran November 1, 1295 James II of Aragon<br>
  12. Leonora, (August 1289 - August 9, 1341, Monastery of St. Nicholas, Arene), married at Messina May 17, 1302 Frederick III of Sicily<br>
  13. Maria (1290 - c. 1346), married at Palma de Majorca September 20, 1304 Sancho I of Majorca, married 1326 Jaime de Ejerica (1298 - April 1335)<br>
  14. Beatrice (1295 - c. 1321), married April 1305 Azzo VIII, Margrave d'Este (d. 1308), married 1309 Bertrand III of Baux, Count of Andria (d. 1351)<br>
</p>
Emme DE ANJOU
<p>
<a name ="I010448"><b>[I010448]</b></a><br />
Her mother may not have been Matilda, rather Geoffrey's consort.<br>
<br>
Possible other spouse is Fafydd ap Owain:<br>
Dafydd ab Owain Gwynedd (died 1203) was Prince of Gwynedd from 1170 to 1195. He was the son of Owain Gwynedd by Cristin verch Goronwy. For a time he ruled jointly with his brothers Maelgwyn ab Owain Gwynedd and Rhodri ab Owain Gwynedd.<br>
<br>
Upon the death of Owain Gwynedd in 1170, his sons fell into dispute over lordship of Gwynedd. Together, Dafydd and Rhodri attacked and killed their brother Hywel that same year. Dafydd drove out Maelgwn in 1173, sending him fleeing to Ireland. Another brother, Cynan, died in 1174, removing one more contender for the throne.<br>
<br>
Dafydd married Emme of Anjou, the half-sister of King Henry II of England, in summer 1174. Emme was an illegitimate daughter of Geoffrey of Anjou. They had four children: Owain, Einion, Gwenllian, and Gwenhwyfar.<br>
<br>
In 1175 he captured his brother, Rhodri ab Owain Gwynedd. Rhodri escaped however, and the two brothers continued to vie for lordship. In 1194 Dafydd faced his nephew, Llywelyn Fawr, who drove him from most of his possessions and imprisoned him in 1197. He was released a year later thanks to the efforts of Hubert Walter, Archbishop of Canterbury. Dafydd retired to England, where he died in May 1203. Emme died in or after 1214, when she disappears from the Pipe Rolls.<br>
</p>
Fulk I DE ANJOU
<p>
<a name ="I010296"><b>[I010296]</b></a><br />
Fulk I of Anjou, called the Red, was son of viscount Ingelger of Angers, and was the first count of Anjou from 898 to 941. He increased the territory of the viscounty of Angers and it became a county around 930. During his reign he was permanently at war with the Normans and the Bretons. He occupied the county of Nantes in 907, but abandoned it to the Bretons in 919. He died around 941 and was succeeded by his son Fulk II.<br>
</p>
Fulk II DE ANJOU
<p>
<a name ="I005243"><b>[I005243]</b></a><br />
Fulk II of Anjou, son of Fulk the Red, was count of Anjou from 941 to 958. He was often at war with the Bretons. He seems to have been a man of culture, a poet and an artist. In 958 he was succeeded by Geoffrey Greymantle.<br>
</p>
Fulk IV DE ANJOU
<p>
<a name ="I005004"><b>[I005004]</b></a><br />
From Wikipedia<br>
<br>
Fulk IV of Anjou (1043 - 1109), also known as Fulk le Réchin, was count of Anjou from 1068 to 1109.<br>
<br>
The nickname by which he is usually referred has no certain translation. Philologists have made numerous very different suggestions, including "quarreler", "sullen", and "heroic".<br>
<br>
He was the younger son of Geoffrey (sometimes known as Alberic), count of Gâtinais, and Ermengarde of Anjou, a daughter of Fulk Nera, count of Anjou, and sister of Geoffrey Martel, also count of Anjou.<br>
<br>
When Geoffrey Martel died without direct heirs he left Anjou to his nephew Geoffrey IV of Anjou, Fulk le Réchin's older brother.<br>
<br>
Fulk fought with his brother, whose ruled was deemed incompetent, and captured him in 1067. Under pressure from the Church he released Geoffrey. The two brothers soon fell to fighting again, and the next year Geoffrey was again imprisoned by Fulk, this time for good.<br>
<br>
Substantial territory was lost to Angevin control due to the difficulties resulting from Geoffrey's poor rule and the subsequent civil war. Saintonge was lost, and Fulk had to give the Gâtinais to Philip I of France to placate the king.<br>
<br>
Much of Fulk's rule was devoted to regaining control over the Angevin baronage, and to a complex struggle with Normandy for influence in Maine and Brittany.<br>
<br>
In 1096 Fulk wrote an incomplete history of Anjou and its rulers, though the authorship and authenticity of this work is disputed. If he did write it, it is one of the first medieval works of history written by a layman.<br>
<br>
Fulk may have married as many as five times; there is some doubt regarding two of the marriages.<br>
<br>
His first wife was Ermengarde de Beaugency. After her death he married Ermengarde de Borbon, and then possibly Ermengarde de Châtellailon. Both these were repudiated, possibly on grounds of consanguinity.<br>
<br>
Next he married Bertrade de Montfort, who apparently left him for Philip I of France. Finally, he may have married a daughter of Walter of Brienne.<br>
<br>
He had two sons. The eldest (a son of Ermengarde de Borbon), Geoffrey Martel II, ruled jointly with his father for some time, but died in 1106. The younger (a son of Bertrade de Montfort) succeeded as Fulk V.<br>
<br>
He also had a daughter, Ermengarde, who married William VII the Young, count of Poitou and duke of Aquitaine.<br>
</p>
Fulk Nera DE ANJOU
<p>
<a name ="I015206"><b>[I015206]</b></a><br />
From Wikipedia<br>
<br>
Fulk III (972-1040), called Nerra (that is, le Noir, "the Black") after his death, was count of Anjou from 987 to 1040. He was the son of Geoffrey Greymantle and Adelaide of Vermandois.<br>
<br>
He was the founder of the Angevin dynasty. He had a violent nature and performed both cruelties and acts of penitence; he made four pilgrimages to the Holy Land. In probably his most notorious act, Fulk Nerra had his first wife (and cousin) Élisabeth de Vendôme burned to death at the stake in her wedding dress, after discovering her with a goatherd in December 999.<br>
<br>
Erdoes says of him: "Fulk of Anjou, plunderer, murderer, robber, and swearer of false oaths, a truly terrifying character of fiendish cruelty, founded not one but two large abbeys. This Fulk was filled with unbridled passion, a temper directed to extremes. Whenever he had the slightest difference with a neighbor he rushed upon his lands, ravaging, pillaging, raping, and killing; nothing could stop him, least of all the commandments of God."<br>
<br>
He fought against the claims of the counts of Rennes, defeating and killing Conan I of Rennes at the Battle of Conquereuil in 992. He then extended his power over the County of Maine and the Touraine. All of his enterprises came up against the no less violent ambition of the Odo II of Blois, against whom he made an alliance with the Capetians. In 1025, after capturing and burning the city of Saumur, Fulk reportedly cried, "Saint Florentius, let yourself be burned. I will build you a better home in Angers." But when the transportation of the saint's relics to Angers proved difficult, Fulk declared that Florentius was a rustic lout unfit for the city, and sent the relics back to Saumur.<br>
<br>
Fulk also commissioned many buildings. From 987 to 1040, while he was count of Anjou and fighting against the Bretons and Blois, protecting his territory from Vendôme to Angers and from Angers to Montrichard, he had more than a hundred castles, donjons, and abbeys constructed. These numerous pious foundations, however, followed his many acts of violence against the church.<br>
<br>
Fulk died in 1040 in Metz.<br>
</p>
Fulk V DE ANJOU
<p>
<a name ="I005002"><b>[I005002]</b></a><br />
From Wikipedia<br>
<br>
Fulk of Anjou (1092 - November 10, 1143), king of Jerusalem from 1131, was the son of Fulk IV, count of Anjou, and his wife Bertrada (who ultimately deserted her husband and became the mistress of Philip I of France).<br>
<br>
Count of Anjou<br>
He became count of Anjou (as Fulk V) in 1109. He was originally an opponent of Henry I of England and a supporter of Louis VI of France, but in 1127 he allied with Henry when Henry arranged for his daughter Matilda to marry Fulk's son Geoffrey of Anjou. Fulk went on crusade in 1120, and become a close friend of the Knights Templar. After his return he began to subsidize the Templars, and maintained two knights in the Holy Land for a year.<br>
<br>
<br>
Crusader and king<br>
By 1127 Fulk was preparing to return to Anjou when he received an embassy from King Baldwin II of Jerusalem. Baldwin II had no male heirs but had already designated his daughter Melisende to succeed him. Baldwin II wanted to safeguard his daughter's inheritance by marring her to a powerful lord. Fulk was a wealthy crusader and experienced military commander, and a widower. His experience in the field would prove invaluable in a frontier state always in the grip of war.<br>
<br>
However, Fulk held out for better terms then mere consort of the Queen; he wanted to be king alongside Melisende. Baldwin II, reflecting on Fulk's fortune and military exploits, acquiesced. Fulk abdicated his county seat of Anjou to his son Geoffery and left for Jerusalem, where he married Melisende on June 2, 1129. Later Balwin II bolstered Melisende's position in the kingdom by making her sole guardian of her son by Fulk, Baldwin III, born in 1130.<br>
<br>
Fulk and Melisende became joint rulers of Jerusalem in 1131 with Baldwin II's death. From the start Fulk assumed sole control of the government, excluding Melisende altogether. He favored fellow countrymen from Anjou to the native nobility. This led to resentment by the second generation of Jerusalem Christians who had grown up there since the First Crusade. These "natives" focused on Melisende's cousin, the popular Hugh II of Le Puiset, count of Jaffa, who was devotedly loyal to the Queen.<br>
<br>
Fulk saw Hugh as a rival, and it did not help matters when Hugh's own step-son accused him of disloyalty. In 1134, in order to expose Hugh, Fulk accused him of infidelity with Melisende. Hugh rebelled in protest. Hugh secured himself to Jaffa, and allied himself with the Muslims of Ascalon. He was able to defeat the army set against him by Fulk, but this situation could not hold. The Patriarch interceded in the conflict, perhaps at the behest of Melisende. Fulk agreed to peace and Hugh was exiled from the kingdom for three years, a lenient sentence.<br>
<br>
However, an unsuccessful assassination attempt was made against Hugh. Fulk, or his supporters, were commonly believed responsible, though direct proof never surfaced. The scandal was all that was needed for the queen's party to take over the government in what amounted to a palace coup. Author and historian Bernard Hamilton wrote that the Fulk's supporters "went in terror of their lives" in the palace. Contemporary author and historian William of Tyre wrote of Fulk "he never attempted to take the initiative, even in trivial matters, without (Melisende's) consent". The result was that Melisende held direct and unquestioned control over the government from 1136 onwards. Sometime before 1136 Fulk reconciled with his wife, and a second son, Amalric was born.<br>
<br>
Securing the borders<br>
Jerusalem's northern border was of great concern. Fulk had been appointed regent of the Principality of Antioch by Baldwin II. As regent he had Raymund of Poitou marry the infant Constance of Antioch, daughter of Bohemund II and Alice of Antioch, and niece to Melisende. However, the greatest concern during Fulk's reign was the rise of Atabeg Zengi of Mosul.<br>
<br>
In 1137 Fulk was defeated in battle near Barin but allied with the vizier of Damascus. Damascus was also threatened by Zengi. Fulk captured the fort of Banias, to the north of Lake Tiberiasand thus secured the northern frontier.<br>
<br>
Fulk also strengthened the kingdom's southern border. His butler Paganus built the fortress of Kerak to the south of the Dead Sea, and to help give the kingdom access to the Red Sea, Fulk had Blanche Garde, Ibelin, and other forts built in the south-west to overpower the Egyptian fortress at Ascalon.<br>
<br>
In 1137 and 1142, Byzantine emperor John II Comnenus arrived in Syria attempting to impose Byzantine control over the crusader states. John's arrival was ignored by Fulk, who declined an invitation to meet the emperor in Jerusalem.<br>
<br>
Death<br>
In 1143, while the king and queen were on holiday in Acre, Fulk was killed in a hunting accident. His horse stumbled, fell, and Fulk's skull was crushed by the saddle. He was carried back to Acre, where he died on November 10th and was buried in the Church of the Holy Sepulchre. Though their marriage started in conflict, Melisende mourned for him privately as well as publicly. Fulk was survived by his son Geoffery of Anjou by his first wife, and Baldwin III and Amalric I by Melisende.<br>
<br>
William of Tyre described Fulk as a capable soldier and able politician, but observed that Fulk did not adequately attend to the defense of the crusader states to the north. The Zengids continued their march on the crusader states, culminating in the fall of the County of Edessa in 1144, which led to the Second Crusade (see Siege of Edessa).<br>
<br>
Family<br>
His first wife was Ermengarde of Maine (died 1126), the daughter of Elias I of Maine. Their children were:<br>
   1. Geoffrey of Anjou<br>
   2. Sibylle of Anjou (1112-1165, Bethlehem), married in 1123 William Clito (div. 1124), married in 1134 Thierry, Count of Flanders<br>
   3. Alice (or Isabella) (1107-1154, Fontevrault), married William Adelin; after his death in the White Ship she became a nun and later Abbess of Fontevrault.<br>
   4. Elias II of Maine<br>
<br>
His second wife was Melisende, Queen of Jerusalem<br>
   1. Baldwin III of Jerusalem<br>
   2. Amalric I of Jerusalem<br>
</p>
Geoffrey DE ANJOU
<p>
<a name ="I005241"><b>[I005241]</b></a><br />
Geoffrey I of Anjou, known as Grisegonelle ("Greymantle"), was count of Anjou from 958 to 987. He succeeded his father Fulk II. He allied with the County of Nantes against the County of Rennes, and allied with Hugh Capet, fearing an invasion by the Count of Blois. He was one of the men responsible for bringing Hugh to the throne of France.<br>
</p>
Geoffrey Martel DE ANJOU
<p>
<a name ="I005006"><b>[I005006]</b></a><br />
Geoffrey III of Anjou, called le Barbu ("the Bearded"), was the eldest son of Ermenegarde, the daughter of Fulk III of Anjou, and of the count of Gâtinais. He succeeded his uncle Geoffrey II in 1060, but his power was limited by attacks from his own brother Fulk IV. A serious confrontation with the Church led to his condemnation by a council, then his deposition and imprisonment in 1068. He was freed by the intervention of Pope Urban II in 1096, and died soon after.<br>
</p>
Geoffrey V DE ANJOU
<p>
<a name ="I005000"><b>[I005000]</b></a><br />
"Le Bel" (The Fair), Comte d'Anjou, Duc de Normandie.<br>
On Henry I death in 1135, he claimed the duchy of Normandie, conquering it in 1144.<br>
He hold the duchy, with that of Anjou, until granting them to his son Henry.<br>
Geoffrey was the original Plantaganet, so named by his companions for the broom corn he wore on his person.<br>
It is through Geoffrey that the Plantaganet line from France was brought into the British royalty (see the lineage of the Counts of Anjou elsewhere). He died in 1151. After Geoffrey's death Matilda lived in Normandy, charitable and respected. Matilda died in 1167. Geoffrey was succeeded by his eldest son, Henry.<br>
<br>
<br>
From Wikipedia<br>
<br>
Geoffrey V (August 24, 1113 - September 7, 1151), Count of Anjou and Maine, and later Duke of Normandy, called Le Bel ("The Fair") or "Geoffrey Plantagenet", was the father of King Henry II of England, and thus the forefather of the Plantagenet dynasty of English kings.<br>
<br>
Geoffrey was the eldest son of Fulk, Count of Anjou and King-Consort of Jerusalem. Geoffrey's mother was Eremburge of La Flèche, heiress of Maine. Geoffrey received his nickname for the sprig of broom (= genêt plant, in French) he wore in his hat as a badge. In 1127, at Le Mans, at the age of 15 he married Empress Matilda, the daughter and heiress of King Henry I of England, by his first wife, Edith of Scotland and widow of Henry V, Holy Roman Emperor. The marriage was meant to seal a peace between England/Normandy and Anjou. She was eleven years older than Geoffrey, and their marriage was a stormy one, but she survived him.<br>
<br>
The year after the marriage Geoffrey's father left for Jerusalem (where he was to become king), leaving Geoffrey behind as count of Anjou. Chroniclers describe Geoffrey as handsome, red-headed, jovial, and a great warrior; however, Ralph of Diceto alleges that his charm concealed his cold and selfish character.<br>
<br>
When King Henry I died in 1135, Matilda at once entered Normandy to claim her inheritance. The border districts submitted to her, but England chose her cousin Stephen of Blois for its king, and Normandy soon followed suit. The following year, Geoffrey gave Ambrieres, Gorron, and Chatilon-sur-Colmont to Juhel de Mayenne, on condition that he help obtain the inheritance of Geoffrey's wife. In 1139 Matilda landed in England with 140 knights, where she was besieged at Arundel Castle by King Stephen. In the "Anarchy" which ensued, Stephen was captured at Lincoln in February, 1141, and imprisoned at Bristol. A legatine council of the English church held at Winchester in April 1141 declared Stephen deposed and proclaimed Matilda "Lady of the English". Stephen was subsequently released from prison and had himself recrowned on the anniversary of his first coronation.<br>
<br>
During 1142 and 1143, Geoffrey secured all of Normandy west and south of the Seine, and, on 14 January, 1444, he crossed the Seine and entered Rouen. He assumed the title of Duke of Normandy in the summer of 1144. In 1144, he founded an Augustine priory at Chateau-l'Ermitage in Anjou. Geoffrey held the duchy until 1149, when he and Matilda conjointly ceded it to their son, Henry, which cession was formally ratified by King Louis VII of France the following year.<br>
<br>
Geoffrey also put down three baronial rebellions in Anjou, in 1129, 1135, and 1145-1151. The threat of rebellion slowed his progress in Normandy, and is one reason he could not intervene in England. In 1153, the Treaty of Westminster allowed Stephen should remain King of England for life and that Henry, the son of Geoffrey and Matilda should succeed him.<br>
<br>
At Château-du-Loir, Geoffrey died suddenly on September 7, 1151, still a young man. He was buried at St. Julien's in Le Mans France. Geoffrey and Matilda's children were:<br>
   1. Henry II of England (1133-1189)<br>
   2. Geoffrey, Count of Nantes (1134-1158)<br>
   3. William, Count of Poitiers (1136-1164)<br>
<br>
Geoffrey also had illegitimate children by an unknown mistress (or mistresses): Hamelin; Emme, who married Dafydd Ab Owain Gwynedd, Prince of North Wales; and Mary, (1181-1216) who became a nun and Abbess of Shaftesbury and who may be the poetess Marie de France.<br>
<br>
The first reference to Norman heraldry was in 1128, when Henry I of England knighted his son-in-law Geoffrey and granted him a badge of gold lions (or leopards) on a blue background. (A gold lion may already have been Henry's own badge.) Henry II used two gold lions and two lions on a red background are still part of the arms of Normandy. Henry's son, Richard I, added a third lion to distinguish the arms of England.<br>

Ingelger I DE ANJOU
<p>
<a name ="I010295"><b>[I010295]</b></a><br />
Ingelger was a viscount who held territory around Orléans and Angers at the end of the 9th century. His son Fulk became the first count of Anjou. After Robert the Strong, he directed the resistance to the Norman invasions on the Loire.<br>

Lionel DE ANTWERP
<p>
<a name ="I008469"><b>[I008469]</b></a><br />
Lionel of Antwerp, Duke of Clarence, (November 29, 1338 - October 7, 1368) was the second son of Edward III of England and Philippa of Hainault. He was so called because he was born at Antwerp, Belgium.<br>
<br>
Betrothed when a child to Elizabeth de Burgh, 4th Countess of Ulster (d. 1363), daughter and heiress of William Donn de Burgh, 3rd Earl of Ulster (d. 1332), he was married to her in 1352, but before this date he had entered into possession of her great Irish inheritance. He was called Earl of Ulster from 1347.<br>
<br>
Having been named as his father's representative in England in 1345 and again in 1346, Lionel joined an expedition into France in 1355, but his chief energies were reserved for the affairs of Ireland.<br>
<br>
Appointed governor of that country, he landed at Dublin in 1361, and in November of the following year was created Duke of Clarence, while his father made an abortive attempt to secure for him the crown of Scotland. His efforts to secure an effective authority over his Irish lands were only moderately successful; and after holding a parliament at Kilkenny, which passed the celebrated Statute of Kilkenny in 1367, he dropped the task in disgust and returned to England.<br>
<br>
Lionel's wife died in Dublin in 1363, having given birth to a daughter, Philippa, whose descendants would one day claim the throne for the House of York. A second marriage was arranged for Lionel with Yolande or Violante, daughter of Galeazzo Visconti, lord of Pavia (d. 1378); the enormous dowry which Galeazzo promised with his daughter being exaggerated by the rumour of the time. Journeying to fetch his bride, Lionel was received in great state both in France and Italy, and was married to Violante at Milan in June 1368. Some months were then spent in festivities, during which Lionel was taken ill at Alba, where he died.<br>
<br>
His only child, Philippa Plantagenet, married in 1368 Edmund Mortimer, 3rd Earl of March (1351-1381). They were parents to Anne de Mortimer, grandparents to Richard Plantagenet, 3rd Duke of York and great-grandparents to Edward IV and Richard III.<br>
<br>
The poet Geoffrey Chaucer was at one time a page in Lionel's household.<br>

Adelaide DE AQUITAINE
<p>
<a name ="I004731"><b>[I004731]</b></a><br />
Adele or Adelaide of Aquitaine (or Adelaide of Poitiers) (c. 945 or 952-1004) was the daughter of William III of Aquitaine and Adele of Normandy.<br>
<br>
Her father used her as security for a truce with Hugh Capet, whom she married in 970. In 987, after the death of Louis V, the last Carolingian king of France, Hugh was elected the new king with Adelaide as queen. They were proclaimed at Noyon and blessed at Reims. They were the founders of the Capetian dynasty of France.<br>

Agnes DE AQUITAINE
<p>
<a name ="I007857"><b>[I007857]</b></a><br />
Agnes de Poitou or Empress Agnes (1020-1077) was regent of the Holy Roman Empire from 1056 to 1068.<br>
<br>
She was born to William V, Duke of Aquitaine and Count of Poitou and his wife Agnes of Burgundy.<br>
<br>
Agnes was the second wife of Henry III, Holy Roman Emperor. Among their children were Judith of Swabia and Henry IV, Holy Roman Emperor.<br>
<br>
She was regent during the minority of Henry IV.<br>

Chariberet II DE AQUITAINE
<p>
<a name ="I010226"><b>[I010226]</b></a><br />
Charibert II (after 618 - April 8, 632), a son of Clotaire II and his second wife Sichilde, of the Merovingian dynasty, was briefly king in Aquitaine, 629-631/2, with his capital at Toulouse.<br>
<br>
At the death of his father Clotaire II, King of the Franks, died in 629, Charibert made a bid for the kingdom of Neustria against his elder half-brother Dagobert I, who was already king of Austrasia. In the ensuing negotiations, Charibert, a minor, was represented by his uncle Brodulf, the brother of Queen Sichilde. Dagobert had Brodulf killed and ceded the realm of Aquitaine to Charibert. This agreement was confirmed in 631, when Charibert stood godfather to Dagobert's son Sigebert.<br>
<br>
Charibert's realm included Toulouse, Cahors, Agen, Perigueux and Saintes, to which he added to his possessions in Gascony. Charibert was married to Gisela, the heiress of Amand of Gascony. His fighting force subdued the resistance of the Basques, until the whole of the Basque territories was under his control.<br>
<br>
In 632 Charibert died at Blaye, Gironde, possibly assassinated on Dagobert's orders, and soon after that Charibert's infant son Chilperic was also died. The Aquitaine passed again to Dagobert. Both of them are buried in the early Romanesque Basilica of Saint-Romain at Blaye.<br>
<br>
Charibert's surviving son, Boggis, Duke of Aquitaine, (ca 626 - ca 688), was the father of Saint Hubertus, who resigned his worldly claims to his younger brother, who began a line of Merovingian dukes of Aquitaine that lasted until 778, when the last, Loup II, was killed by Charlemagne.<br>

From Wikipedia<br>
<br>
Eleanor of Aquitaine (Bordeaux, France, c. 1122 - March 31, 1204 in Fontevrault, Anjou) was one of the wealthiest and most powerful women in Europe during the Middle Ages. She was Queen consort of both France and England in her lifetime.<br>
<br>
Biography<br>
Childhood<br>
The eldest of three children, her father was William X, Duke of Aquitaine, and her mother was Ænor de Châtellerault, the daughter of Aimeric I, Vicomte of Chatellerault. William and Ænor's marriage had been arranged by his father, William IX of Aquitaine the Troubador, and her mother, Dangereuse, William IX's long-time mistress. Eleanor was named after her mother and called Aliénor, which means other Aenor in the langue d'oc, but it became Eléanor in the northern langue d'oil and in English.<br>
<br>
She was raised in one of Europe's most cultured courts, the birthplace of courtly love. She was highly educated for a woman of the time, and knew how to read, how to speak Latin, was well versed in music and literature, and enjoyed riding, hawking, and hunting. She became heiress to Aquitaine, the largest and richest of the provinces that would become modern France, when her brother, William Aigret, died as a baby.<br>
<br>
Power and Marriage to Louis VII of France<br>
William X died on Good Friday, 1137 while on a pilgrimage to Spain. At about 15, Eleanor was now Duchess of Aquitaine, and the most eligible heiress in Europe. As these were the days when kidnapping an heiress was seen as a viable option for attaining title, William wrote a will on the very day he died, instructing that his daughter marry Louis VII of France. The marriage, on July 22, 1137, brought to France the area from the river Loire to the Pyrenees: most of what is today the southwest of France. However, there was a catch: the land would remain independent of France, and Eleanor's eldest son would be both King of France and Duke of Aquitaine. Thus, her holdings would not be merged with France until the next generation. She gave him a wedding present that is still in existence, a rock crystal vase on display at the Louvre. Within a month of their marriage, Louis VI died, and Eleanor became Queen of France.<br>
<br>
Something of a free spirit, Eleanor was not much liked by the staid northerners (particularly, according to sources, her mother-in-law, Adélaide de Maurienne), who thought her flighty and a bad influence. Her conduct was repeatedly criticized by Church elders (particularly Bernard of Clairvaux and Abbot Suger) as indecorous. The King, on the other hand, was madly in love with his beautiful and worldly wife, and granted her every whim, even though her behavior baffled and vexed him to no end.<br>
<br>
Crusade<br>
When Eleanor supported her sister Petronilla of Aquitaine's illegitimate marriage to Raoul of Vermandois, the incident started a war and caused conflict between Eleanor and Louis. She insisted on taking part in the Crusades as the feudal leader of the soldiers from her duchy. The story that she and her ladies dressed as Amazons is disputed by serious historians. However, her testimonial launch of the Second Crusade from Vézelay, the rumored location of Mary Magdalene's burial, dramatically emphasized the role of women in the campaign, with her, the Queen of France, as their leader.<br>
<br>
The Crusade itself was something of a disaster. Louis was a weak and ineffectual military leader with no concept of maintaining troop discipline or morale, or of making informed and logical tactical decisions. The French army was betrayed by Manuel I Comnenus, Byzantine Emperor, who feared that their aims would jeopardize the tenuous safety of his empire. A particularly poor decision to camp one night in a lush valley surrounded by tall peaks in hostile territory lead to an attack by the Turks, who slaughtered as many as 7000 Crusaders. As this decision was made by Eleanor's servant, it was generally believed that it was her directive; this did nothing for her popularity in Christendom.<br>
<br>
Divorce to Louis<br>
Even before the Crusade, Eleanor and Louis were becoming estranged. The city of Antioch had been annexed by Bohemond of Hauteville in the First Crusade, and it was now ruled by her flamboyant uncle, Raymond of Antioch (rumored to be her lover), who had gained the principality by marrying its reigning Princess, Constance of Antioch. Clearly, Eleanor supported his desire to re-capture the nearby County of Edessa, the cause of the Crusade. Louis was directed by the Church to visit Jerusalem instead. When Eleanor declared her intention to stand with Raymond and the Aquitaine forces, Louis had her brought out by force. His long march to Jerusalem and back north debilitated his army, but her imprisonment disheartened her knights, and the divided Crusade armies could not overcome the Muslim forces. For reasons unknown, likely the Germans' insistence on conquest, the Crusade leaders targeted Damascus, an ally until the attack. Failing in this attempt, they retired to Jerusalem, and then home.<br>
<br>
When they passed through Rome on the way to Paris, Pope Eugene III tried to reconcile Eleanor and Louis. Eleanor conceived their second daughter, Alix of France (their first was Marie), but there was no saving the marriage. In 1152; it was annulled on the grounds of consanguinity. Her estates reverted to her and were no longer part of the French royal properties.<br>
<br>
However, it was while in the eastern Mediterranean, Eleanor learned about maritime conventions developing there: the beginnings of what would become admiralty law. She introduced those conventions in her own lands, on the island of Oleron in 1160, and then into England. She was also instrumental in developing trade agreements with Constantinople and ports of trade in the Holy Lands.<br>
<br>
Marriage to Henry II of England<br>
On May 18, 1152, six weeks after her annullment, Eleanor married Henry Plantagenet, Count of Anjou and Duke of Normandy. She was about 11 years older than he, and related to him in the same degree as she had been to Louis. One of Eleanor's rumored lovers was Henry's own father, Geoffrey of Anjou, who, not surprisingly, advised him not to get involved with her. Over the next 13 years, she bore Henry five sons and three daughters: William, Henry, Richard, Geoffrey, John, Matilda, Eleanor, and Joan.<br>
<br>
Despite her reputation (which all the historical evidence shows was probably deserved), Eleanor was incensed by Henry's philandering; their son, William, and Henry's bastard son, Geoffrey, were born months apart. Henry fathered other bastard children throughout most of their marriage.<br>
<br>
Some time between 1168 and 1170, she instigated a separation, deciding to establish a new court in her own territory of Poitou. In Poitiers, she reached the height of her powers creating the Court of Love. A small fragment of her codes and practices was written by Andreas Capellanus.<br>
<br>
Henry concentrated on controlling his increasingly-large empire, badgering Eleanor's subjects in attempts to control her patrimony of Aquitaine and her court at Poitiers. Straining all bounds of civility, Henry had Archbishop Thomas Becket murdered at the altar of the church in 1170 (to be fair, there is debate as to if it truly was Henry's intent to be rid of his Archbishop once and for all). This aroused not only Eleanor's horror and contempt, but most of Europe's.<br>
<br>
Revolt and imprisonment<br>
In 1173, aggrieved at his lack of power and egged on by his father's enemies, the younger Henry launched the Revolt of 1173-1174, joined by Richard and Geoffrey, and supported by several powerful English barons, as well as Louis VII and William I of Scotland. When Eleanor tried to join them, she was intercepted. Henry, who put down the rebellion, imprisoned her for the next 15 years, much of the time in various locations in England. About four miles from Shrewsbury and close by Haughmond Abbey is "Queen Eleanor's Bower," the remains of a triangular castle which is believed to have been one of her prisons.<br>
<br>
Henry lost his great love, Rosamund Clifford, in 1176. He had met her in 1166 and begun the liaison in 1173, supposedly contemplating divorce from Eleanor. When Rosamund died, rumours flew that Eleanor poisoned her, but there is no evidence to support this.<br>
<br>
In 1183, Henry the Young tried again. In debt and refused control of Normandy, he tried to ambush his father at Limoges. He was joined by troops sent by his brother Geoffrey and Philip II of France. Henry's troops besieged the town, forcing his son to flee. Henry the Young wandered aimlessly through Aquitaine until he caught dysentery and died. The rebellion petered out.<br>
<br>
Upon Henry's death in 1189, Eleanor helped her son Richard I to the throne, and he released her from prison. She ruled England as regent while Richard went off on the Third Crusade. She personally negotatied his ransom by going to Germany. She survived him and lived long enough to see her youngest son John on the throne.<br>
<br>
Eleanor died in 1204 and was entombed in Fontevraud Abbey near her husband Henry and son Richard. Her tomb effigy shows her reading a Bible. She was the patroness of such literary figures as Wace, Benoı̂t de Sainte-More, and Chrétien de Troyes.<br>
</p>
Eudes DE AQUITAINE
<p>
<a name ="I010222"><b>[I010222]</b></a><br />
Odo of Aquitaine (a.k.a. Eudes the Great) (d. ca. 736), duke of Aquitaine, obtained this dignity about 715, and his territory included the southwestern part of Gaul from the Loire to the Pyrenees, with his capital in Toulouse.<br>
<br>
In 718 he appears as the ally of Chilperic II, king of Neustria, who was fighting against the Austrasian mayor of the palace, Charles Martel; but after the defeat of Chilperic at Soissons in 719 he probably made peace with Charles by surrendering to him the Neustrian king and his treasures.<br>
<br>
Odo was also obliged to fight the Saracens who invaded the southern part of his kingdom, and inflicted a severe defeat upon them at the Battle of Toulouse on June 9, 721. When, however, he was again attacked by Charles Martel, the Saracens renewed their ravages, and Odo was defeated near Bordeaux; he was compelled to crave protection from Charles, who took up this struggle and gained his momentous victory at Poitiers in 732. In 735 the king abdicated, and was succeeded by his son Hunald.<br>
</p>
Guillaume III DE AQUITAINE
<p>
<a name ="I004818"><b>[I004818]</b></a><br />
William III of Aquitaine (915 - April 3, 963), nicknamed Tête d'Étoupe (Towhead) was William II of Poitou Count of Poitiers and Duke of Aquitaine from 935 to his death.<br>
<br>
William was son of Ebalus of Aquitaine and Emiliene. He married Gerloc of Normandy (renamed Adele), daughter of Rollo of Normandy. They had at least two children: Adelaide, who married king Hugh I of France (Hugh Capet) and William, the heir.<br>
