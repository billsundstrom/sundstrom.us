<p>
<a name ="I029075"><b>[I029075]</b></a><br />
HUDGINS, Betty Mae - 79, Brickton, passed away peacefully on June 6, 2005, in Soldiers Memorial Hospital, Middleton. Born in Digby on March 11, 1926, she was the dearly loved daughter of the late Frank and Janet (Ellis) Wilson. She was the dedicated wife of William "Bill" Hudgins and her life was committed to the care and well-being of her family. Betty will be fondly remembered by all of those who knew her for her kindness and generosity. She instilled in her children a strong sense of family and believed that families are always there for each other. Her greatest gift was one of strength and survival. Her motto in life, "you have to survive another day, for tomorrow might just be a better one", was evident in her constant struggle with poor health. She never complained and often rose above her health issues to care for others. She was a past member of the United Church Women's Institute where she and her dear friend, Ann Brown, spent many a late night inventing new crafts and planning their next adventure. Betty enjoyed playing bridge with the local bridge club. She loved to paint and shared her art with all friends and family. Surviving are son, Patrick (Val), Windsor; daughter, Heather (Stephen) Hudgins-Grant, Kentville; grandchildren, Jacqueline Shortliffe, Halifax; Adam Shortliffe, Vancouver, B.C.; Luke Hudgins, Windsor; Leigh (Kim) Grant, Halifax; Kristopher Grant, Kentville; Adam (Chelsea Brewster) Grant, Halifax; Justin Grant, Kentville; great-grandchildren, Rebecca Coffey, Brennan Raby, Patrick Grant; sisters, Helen Fleet and Janet Merry; brother, Robert; devoted friend, Joan Hudgins, and several nieces and nephews.

Charles Seth WILSON
<p>
<a name ="I002122"><b>[I002122]</b></a><br />
Seth Wilson, 92, died Monday, but the imprint that the Ozark Christian College dean emeritus left on the Joplin campus is deeply embedded, said Matt Proctor, OCC president.<br>
If ever a name could be connected with the pioneering of OCC, it would be that of Wilson, who in 1940 was tabbed as dean of the Christian-vocation school that started in Bentonville, Ark.<br>
Wilson, who taught 51 years in college and seminary classes, continued as dean when the college changed its name to Ozark Bible College and moved to Joplin in 1944. He retained that role until 1979. He also served as secretary to the trustees from 1942 to 1991, and he became dean emeritus in 1979.<br>
The college changed its name back to Ozark Christian in 1985, when Midwest Christian College of Oklahoma City, Okla., consolidated with Ozark Bible on the Joplin campus.<br>
"Any history of Ozark Bible College would have to start, 'In the beginning, Seth,'" said Ken Idleman, former longtime OCC president.<br>
Wilson received a bachelor's degree in 1936 from Cincinnati (Ohio) Bible Seminary, where he also took graduate courses and taught. He wrote several books, and hundreds of essays, studies and outlines related to the study of the life of Christ.<br>
"He declined an offer to teach in a graduate seminary, preferring to apply his life to reaching the beginning students, working with the churches, and getting more people to know and love the Lord," said Lynn Gardner, former OCC academic dean and professor.<br>
Wilson, a native of Maryville, was knocked unconscious in an accidental fall Thursday at his home, according to Leasa Frye, OCC public relations director. He was taken to Freeman Hospital West that day, but he never regained consciousness. He died about 3:30 a.m. Monday, Frye said.<br>
Survivors include his wife, Anna Wilson; four sons, Ben Wilson, Carl Wilson, Jonathan Wilson and Timothy Wilson; and six daughters, Leta Wilson, Rebecca Souder, Dora Desrosiers, Lois Miller, Judy Sullens and Joy Hill. No addresses were available for the children.<br>

Charlet D. Emrick, 89, of Paris, Illinois, passed away at 12:10 a.m. Thursday, January 19, 2017, at Pleasant Meadows Senior Living in Chrisman, Illinois.<br>

Survivors include a son, Kevin Ray (Reine) Emrick; a daughter, Debbie Jo (Charles) Curl; a sister, Jessie Branson; two grandchildren; two great-grandchildren and several nieces and nephews.<br>
She was preceded in death by two infant twin daughters; five brothers, Derral, Jerry, Billy, Scotty and Earl Wilson and three sisters, Margie Powell, Rozella Travis and June Grafton.<br>

Damascus home-invasion robbery, beatings get Gresham man 6 years in prison<br>
A man who burst into a Damascus trailer house on Christmas Eve 2011 and beat up the residents was sentenced Monday to almost six years in prison.   <br>
Samuel Hillman Wilson, 56,  and an unidentified accomplice claimed they targeted the residence because a man who owed them money lived there.<br>
A Clackamas County jury found Wilson guilty of robbery, burglary, assault and theft. Clackamas County prosecutor Russell Amos asked Circuit Judge Thomas J. Rastetter to sentence Wilson to nearly 11 years in prison. Defense attorney Andrew Elliott argued that the crimes were all part of a single criminal incident, state sentencing guidelines called for a lesser term.<br>
Wilson, a Gresham resident, has a criminal history that includes convictions for burglary, drunk driving, drug possession and being a felon in possession of a firearm.  <br>
