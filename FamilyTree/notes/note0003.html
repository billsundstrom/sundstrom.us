Edgar Ætheling (c. 1051 - c. 1126) was the last member of the Anglo-Saxonroyal house. Born in Hungary, he was also known as "Edgar the Outlaw".The Anglo-Saxon name Atheling or, more correctly, Ætheling, means "son ofthe king". Proclaimed king by the witan following the death of Harold IIin the Battle of Hastings on October 14, 1066, Edgar was never crownedand submitted to William I some eight weeks later. He was only aboutthirteen or fourteen years old.<br />
 <br />
Edgar was the only son of Edward the Exile, heir to the English throne, and grandson of King Edmund Ironside. Upon his father's death in 1057, Edgar was nominated as Heir Apparent by the king Edward the Confessor. Edgar was brought up at Edward's court, together with his sisters, Margaret and Christina. However he was too young at the time of the king's death in January 1066 to defend the country against impending invasion, and his election as king after Harold's death was no more than a symbolic token of defiance against the invading Norman forces.<br />
 <br />
Edgar relied largely for his support upon Archbishop Stigand and upon Earls Edwin of Mercia and Morcar of Northumbria and, when this weakened, (within a matter of days of the witan), Edgar was forced inevitably to submit to William at Berkhamstead in either late November or early December 1066.<br />
 <br />
William treated Edgar well. Seeing political advantage, he kept him in his custody and eventually took him back to his court in Normandy. However, Edgar joined in the rebellion of the earls Edwin and Morcar in 1068 and, though defeated, he fled to the court of Malcolm III of Scotland. The next year Malcolm married Edgar's sister Margaret, and agreed to support Edgar in his attempt to claim the English crown. In exchange, Edgar married Malcolm's sister, another Margaret. Edgar now made common cause with Sweyn Estridson, the king of Denmark and nephew of Canute, who believed he was the rightful king of England.<br />
 <br />
Their combined forces invaded England in 1069. They captured York, but did not proclaim the independence of Northumbria. William marched on the north, devastating the land as he went. He paid the Danes to leave, whilst Edgar fled to Scotland. He remained in refuge there until 1072 when William successfully enforced a peace treaty on Malcolm, the terms of which included the exile of Edgar. Edgar eventually made his peace with William in 1074 but he never fully gave up his dreams of regaining the throne of England. He supported Robert, Duke of Normandy, against William II in 1091 and again found himself seeking refuge in Scotland. He also supported his nephew, Edgar, in gaining the Scottish throne, overthrowing Donald III.<br />
 <br />
Around 1098 he went to Constantinople, where he may have joined the Varangian Guard of the Byzantine Empire. Later that year he was given a fleet by Emperor Alexius I to assist in the First Crusade, and brought reinforcements to the crusaders at the Siege of Antioch. He was taken prisoner at the Battle of Tinchebrai in 1106 fighting for Duke Robert against Henry I. He returned to England where Henry pardoned him, and he retired to his country estate in Hertfordshire. His niece Edith (renamed Matilda) had married Henry I in 1100. Edgar is believed to have travelled to Scotland late in life, perhaps around the year 1120, and was still alive in 1125, but may have died soon after, in his early seventies. By then he was forgotten by most and is remembered now only as the "lost king" of England.<br />

When he was in high school, John Cassady could bench-press his ownweight, but his skills at a different kind of bench-a lab bench-are wherehe shines these days. A summer of work as an undergraduate researcherwith HHMI investigator Bruce Walker at Massachusetts General Hospital hasinspired Cassady to pursue a Ph.D. in biochemistry and a career in HIVresearch.<br />
Cassady grew up in Minnesota, where he focused on sports as well as academics. As a senior in high school, he was captain of both the football and track teams, and he competed in the Junior Nationals Olympic-style weightlifting championship. From sports, he says, he learned how to cooperate, manage time, and deal with disappointment-skills that should serve him well in a career in scientific research.<br />
With his sights set on being a nuclear engineer to help develop nuclear power for cars, Cassady won admission to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). But during the summer between his freshman and sophomore years of college, he worked for a biology professor at the University of Minnesota. "It was a mundane job, just pipetting and using the mass spectrometer machine, but it was exciting," he says. So, as a sophomore, he switched majors to biology, determined to pursue research "that can actually make a difference in someone's life."<br />
Cassady is drawn to the challenge of fighting AIDS. As a participant in HHMI's Exceptional Research Opportunities Program (EXROP), which offers summer research experiences for disadvantaged and minority undergraduates in the labs of HHMI investigators or HHMI professors, Cassady worked with Walker to analyze HIV's ability to evade immune response by altering the expression of messenger RNA (mRNA) in cells. During his EXROP experience, he says, he was inspired to pursue graduate work in HIV research. He has continued working in Walker's lab approximately 15 hours a week throughout his senior year.<br />
"I chose to research HIV because I'm very interested in how the virus works and the development of a cure for this devastating disease," explained Cassady, 22. He envisions using new techniques, such as stem-cell research, to increase the body's immune response to the virus.<br />
From his own experience changing majors, however, Cassady realizes that goals can change. So he has decided to pursue a Ph.D. in biochemistry, to master versatile research techniques that can be applied to different fields. Currently applying to graduate schools, Cassady is confident about his future. "I know that as long as I work my hardest and stay determined, I will not disappoint myself."<br />

Burial: 1667 Old Wequetoquock Burial Ground, Stonington<br />
The Wequetequock Burial Ground Association in Stonington, CT, on 31Aug 1899, dedicated a monument which had been erected as a memorial to the first four settlers of Wequetequock: William Chesebrough, Thomas Minor, Walter Palmer and Thomas Stanton. Each side of the monument carries an epitaph, above which has been carved a coat of arms.<br />
The Chesebrough epitaph reads as follows:<br />
    William Chesebrough<br />
    The first white settler of Stonington<br />
    Born in England 1594 migrated to America in John<br />
    Winthrop's Company which planted Boston in 1630.<br />
    After spending a few years in Rehoboth Mass.<br />
    he with his wife and four sons in 1649 fixed<br />
    his home in this then wilderness and built his<br />
    dwelling house not far from this monument.<br />
    He took a leading part in the organization<br />
    of the town and the conduct of its early affairs.<br />
    He died June 9, 1667.<br />
    A Bold Pioneer. A Wise Organizer. A Firm Christian.<br />
 <br />
The remains of William & Anna rest side by side in the old cemetery, a short distance from their dwelling house.<br />
 <br />
Immigration: 29 MAR 1630 Salem, Essex, MA<br />
William Chesbrough sailed from Cowes, Eng. in the ship "Arbella" on 29 Mar 1630 and arrived at Salem, MA on 14 Jun 1630, Capt. Peter Milbourne, master. The "Arbella" was a ship of 350 tons and wastermed the "Admiral" of the Winthrop fleet that left Cowes, Eng. in 1630. The fleet consisted of 14 vessels with 840 passengers comprising the Massachusetts Bay Colony. Aboard were William Cheesebrough, from Boston, Lincoln, blacksmith, with wife Ann, daughter Sarah and sons Peter, Samuel & Nathaniel.<br />
Made a freeman of Boston, MA, 18 May 1631, and note is made of the fact that on the same day his house burned to the ground; was one of the first two deputies from Boston to the General Court, was a constable, assessor, and one of a committee "to a lot to able bodied men and youth" grounds for planting.<br />
 <br />
Occupation: Gunsmith 1625 Braintree, Suffolk, MA<br />
William Chesebrough, a gunsmith, came in the spring of 1649, overland from Rehobeth in Plymouth where he had been accused (falsely, he always maintained) of selling firearms to the Indians. He picked a site on a knoll on the west bank at the head of Wequetequock Cove where there was a well sheltered landing place and open meadows for grazing and cultivation. But the authorities suspected he planned illicit trade in rum and firearms with the Indians, so on 7 Nov 1649, the constable at Pequot (New London) informed him that "the Goverm't of Connecticut doth dislike and distastes the way he is in and trade he doth among the Indians' and they doe require him to desiste there from," ordering him to report to Major John Mason at Saybrook and give an account of himself and his lonely settlement.<br />
On 19 Mar 1650, William Chesebrough appeared before the General Court in Hartford which questioned his settling at Wequetequock "in that by his calling (gunsmith) he was fitted, and by his solitary living advantaged, to carry on a mischievous trade with the Indians...extremely prejudiciall to the publique safety...so to withdraw from all publique ordnances and Xtian society." To which he replied that he had sold his tools "thereby making himself incapable of repairing any gun locks" and that he hoped others would join him. He was required to post a bond that others would join his settlement by September next.<br />
 <br />

 <br />
Land 1652 Stonington, New London, CT<br />
The title of William Chesebrough to all land between Wadawanuck Point and Wequetoquock Cove was confirmed by the General Court at NewLondon in 1652.<br />
The action of the General Court of Connecticut in pushing its claims eastward to the Pawcatuck River created many political battles with Massachusets and until the matter could be resolved amicably, the planters were advised "to carry themselves & order their affaires peaceably, and by comon agreement." Acting on this advice, the original settlers and a few others who had joined them, met together on 30 Jun 1658 and organized a local government with what may betermed a consitution, entitled "The Asoiation of Poquatuck peple, "which was signed by eleven persons, viz.: William Cheeseborough and his three sons, Samuel, Nathaniel and Elisha; Thomas Stanton and his son Thomas; Walter Palmer and his two sons Elihu and Moses; George Denison, and Thomas Shaw. This compact in the handwriting of WilliamCheeseborough, pledged the signers "to maintain and deffend the peacof the plac * to aid and asist one another acoarding to law & rules of righteousness, till such other provisions be maide for us as mayatain our end above written.: After affixing their names to the document, the signers chose Capt. George Denison and William Cheeseborough to be "comytioners" to carry out the provisions of the contract. Three months later, the commissioners of the United Colonies decided that the territory in dispute belonged to Massachusetts, and the General Court of that Colony named it Southerntown and annexed it to the County of Suffolk. Southerntown remained a township of MA until the issue of the Charter of CT by King Charles II, dated 25 Apr 1662 fixed the eastern boundary of CT at Pawcatuck River and reverted back to the sister colony.<br />
In 1665, the name of Southerntown was changed to that of Mystic, and the year following was changed to Stonington.<br />
 <br />
Land 1638 Braintree, Suffolk, MA<br />
"Willyam Cheesborough and Anne his wife" admitted to Boston church as members #44 & #45, which would be in the fall of 1630; "Willyam Cheesbrough and Anne his wife" recommended to Braintree church, 16 Feb1639/40; "brother Willyam Cheesebrough and our sister Anne his wife now dwelling at Rehoboth" dismissed from Boston church to Rehobothchurch, 9 Apr 1648.<br />
William was chosen to represent Braintree in the General Court and was made a commissioner or local judge.<br />
"Mr. William Cheesborowe" one of five men to lay out their own farms at "Rumley Marsh," 14 Dec 1635; granted "two rod and a half square of the marsh next unto Mr. Bellingham's woodyard for to build upon," 25Sep 1637.<br />
 <br />
Land 1649 New London, New London, CT<br />
This year a considerable settlement was made between Mistic and Pawcatuck rivers. This tract was called Pequot, and originally belonged to New-London. The first man who settled upon this tract, was William Cheesebrough, from Rehoboth, in 1649. A complaint was exhibited against him for carrying on an illicit trade with the Indians, for repairing their arms, and endangering the public safety. The teneral court of CT declared, that they had a clear title to those lands, and summoned him before them. They reprimanded him for settling upon them without their approbation; for withdrawing himself from Christian society and ordinances; and for unlawfully trading with and assisting the Indians. He confessed his faults; but pleaded, inexcuse, that he had been encouraged by Mr. Winthrop, who claimed aright to Pawcatuck. He gave bonds for his good conduct, and wasallowed to continue upon the land.<br />
After successive explorations William chose the head of Wequetequock Cove, in what is now called Pawcatuck, on the border lands of which he found arable lands for planting, with an abundance of pasture ground for stock raising, to which he had largely turned his attention. After building a dwelling house on the west side of the cove, William removed with his wife and four sons, assisted by his friend, Roger Williams, founder of Rhode Island, in the summer of 1649. William was55 years old, wife Anna 51y, son Samuel 22y, Nathaniel 19y, John 17yand Elisha 12y.<br />
 <br />
Land 1646 Rehoboth, Bristol, MA<br />
On 12 Jul 1644 Rehoboth town meeting ordered that William Cheeseborough "is to have division in all lands of Seekunk for L153besides what he is to have for his own proportion, and that in way of consideration for the pains and charges he hath been at for settling of this plantation."<br />
After a relatively peaceful few years in Boston and Braintree, William removed to Rehoboth where he was soon in trouble with the Plymouth authorities: On 5 May 1646 Plymouth Court ordered that theconstable at Rehoboth arrest "Willm Cheesborrow" for his part in "anaffray made upon Ussamequine and some of his people"; "Wm. Cheesborrow of Rehoboth, blacksmith," had to post L20 bond. On 2 Jun 1646 the court reported that "William Cheesborrow, of Rehoboth, for mending two locks for pieces at three shillings apiece, and for his abuse of Ussamequin, as the case now stands betwixt us and him, and for his breach of imprisonment and flying to a foreign government, and leaving this, is censured by the Court to be imprisoned fourteen days, without bail or main prize, and to pay L6 fine to the colony's use." (The "foreign government" may have been Providence, RI, since on 22 Jun 1645 Roger Williams reported to John Winthrop Jr. that "Wm Cheesbrough now come in shall be readily assisted for your and his own sake.")<br />
 <br />
 <br />
----------------<br />
WILLIAM CHESEBROUGH, was the first white man who settled Stonington, Connecticut. His dwelling house stood on the west side of Wequetequock Cove, near the head of the tidewater.<br />
 <br />
Chesebrough was born in Boston, Lincolnshire, England in 1594. On December 6, 1620, he married Anna Stevenson. He was a gunsmith until he came to Stonington in 1649, when he became a farmer, living on the large grants of land given him by the town of Pequot (now New London).<br />
 <br />
He came to this country with the John Winthrop Company in 1630 and first settled in Boston, Massachusetts and became a member of the first church. In May 1631, he was admitted a freeman of the Massachusetts Colony.<br />
 <br />
In 1634, he was elected constable of Boston. He later moved to Braintree, and in 1640 he was elected deputy to the Massachusetts General Court. Soon after, he moved to Rehoboth, Plymouth Colony where he took an active and prominent part in organizing the town of Rehoboth.<br />
 <br />
The General Court of that colony later ordered him to be arrested for an affray with an Indian, which led him to look further for a new permanent home. John Winthrop, Jr. urged Chesebrough to settle in his new settlement at Pequot, but he decided against it and and finally chose to settle at the head of Wequetequock Cove in the Pawcatuck area instead. It was another friend, Roger Williams, who encouraged and assisted him in moving to Pawcatuck during the summer of 1649 when he moved his family into their new house in Wequetequock, including his wife and four sons, Samuel, Nathaniel, John and Elisha.<br />
 <br />
Mr. Chesebrough, traded with the Indians and with people of Long Island, which was prohibited by the General Assembly of Connecticut. In January, 1652, the town of Pequot gave him a large tract of land, which was afterwards liberally enlarged until it embraced between two and three thousand acres. Mr. Chesebrough succeeded in drawing around him a number of "acceptable persons" and the settlement of the town was begun. In 1654, however, the planters wanted to separate from Pequot for religious and civil purposes. This measure was resisted by the planters at Pequot. In the meantime, Massachusetts laid claim to the settlement, and the dispute went up to the court of the Commissioners of the United Colonies. In 1658 the court awarded all the territory east of Mystic River to the Massachusetts Colony, under the name of Southertown, until 1662, when it was included in the new charter, and again became a part of the colony of Connecticut. In 1665, the name Southertown was changed to Mystic. In 1666, it was again changed to Stonington.<br />
 <br />
Mr. Chesebrough held numerous positions of trust not only in the Massachusetts Colony, in the town of Rehoboth, in Plymouth Colony as well. He was elected to several positions between 1653 and 1656.<br />
 <br />
He held the office of Townsman (Selectman) until Southertown was annexed to Connecticut, and was the first man elected deputy after the reunion. He succeeded in restoring amicable relations with the Court which had been seriously disturbed by the jurisdictional controversy. After his return, he was elected first selectman of the town, and re-elected every year up to the time of his death, on June 9, 1667.<br />

 <br />
William was the son of William IV of Aquitaine by his wife Emma of Blois. He seems to have taken after his formidable mother, who ruled Aquitaine until 1004. He was a friend to Fulbert of Chartres and founded a cathedral school at Poitiers. He himself was very well educated, a collector of books, and turned the prosperous court of Aquitaine into the learning center of Southern France.<br />

From Wikipedia<br />
 <br />
William VIII of Aquitaine, (Guillaume VIII in French) (1025 - September 25, 1086), whose name was Guy-Geoffroy before becoming duke of Aquitaine, was Duke of Gascony (1052-1086), and then Duke of Aquitaine and Count of Poitiers (as William VI of Poitiers) between 1058 and 1086, succceeding his brother William VII (Pierre-Guillaume). Guy-Geoffroy was the youngest son of William V of Aquitaine by his third wife Agnes of Burgundy. He was the brother-in-law of Henry III, Holy Roman Emperor who had married his sister, Agnes de Poitiers.<br />
 <br />
He became Duke of Gascony in 1052 during his older brother William VII's rule. Gascony had come to Aquitanian rule through William V's marriage to Prisca (a.k.a Brisce) of Gascony, the sister of Duke Sans VI Guilhem of Gascony.<br />
 <br />
William VIII was one of the leaders of the allied army called to help Ramiro I of Aragon in the siege of Barbastro (1064). This expedition was the first campaign organized by the papacy, namely Pope Alexander II, against a Muslim city, and the precursor of the later Crusades movement. Aragon and its allies conquered the city, killed its inhabitants and collected an important booty. However, Aragon lost the city again in the following years. During William VIII's rule, the alliance with the southern kingdoms of modern Spain was a political priority as shown by the marriage of all his daughters to Iberian kings.<br />
 <br />
He married three times and had at least five children. After he divorced his second wife due to infertility, he remarried to a much younger woman who was also his cousin. This marriage produced a son, but William VIII had to visit Rome in the early 1070s to persuade the pope to recognize his children from his third marriage as legitimate.<br />
 <br />
* First wife: Garsende of Périgord, daughter of Count Aldabert II of Périgord and his wife Alausie, herself the second daughter of duke Sans VI Guilhem of Gascony (divorced November 1058), no children. She became a nun at Saintes.<br />
 <br />
* Second wife: Matoeda (divorced May 1068)<br />
   1. Agnes (1052-1078), married Alfonso VI of Castile<br />
 <br />
 <br />
* Third wife: Hildegarde of Burgundy (daughter of duke Robert I of Burgundy)<br />

Capt. Ceorge Denison, son of William, b. 1618, Eng.; d. 23 Oct., 1694, Hartford; m. 1645 his 2nd wife Ann Borrodell (b. 1615; d. 26 Sept., 1712) daughter of John Borrodell of Cork, Ireland, but who was then living near the battlefield of Naseby. George came with his father in the "Lion" 1631; but his first wife dying, he returned to England served with distinction under Cromwell; at Naseby he was severely wounded, taken to the house of John Borrodell,481 nursed by his daughter Ann whom he afterwards married. Again coming to New England he settled near Stonington.<br />
During King Philip's war he was a leader in ten expeditions against the Indians, in one of which he captured Canonchet.<br />
 <br />
Children by second marriage to Ann Borrodell:<br />
   1. George Denison b: 1653 in Barnstable, Massachusetts<br />
   2. Capt. John Boradell Denison<br />
   3. Ann Denison<br />
   4. Borodell Denison<br />
   5. William Denison<br />
   6. Margaret Denison<br />
   7. Mercy Mary Denison<br />
 <br />
-----------------------<br />
 <br />
He was the son of William and Margaret (Chandler) (Monck) Denison. He married first Bridget Thompson and second Ann Borodell.<br />
 <br />
George Denison died in Hartford, Oct. 23, 1694, while there on some special business, being 76 years old. His wife, Ann Borodel1, died Sept. 26, 1712, aged 97 years. They were both remarkable for magnificent personal appearance, and for force of mind and character. She was always called "Lady Ann." They held a foremost place in Stonington. At the time of their marriage, in 1645, she was 30 years old and he 27. He has been described as "the Miles Standish of the settlement," but he was a greater and more brilliant soldier than Miles Standish. He had no equal in any of the colonies, for conducting a war against the Indians, excepting, perhaps, Captain John Mason.<br />
 <br />
George's brother, General Daniel Denison wrote in 1672: " My Brother George buried his first Wife in the year 1643, went into England, was a souldier ther above a year, was at the Battle of York or Marston Moor where he did good service, was afterward taken prisoner, but got free, and having married a second Wife, he returned to New England the year before our Mother died, and not long afterward removed himself to New London, near whereunto at Stonington he now liveth."<br />
The story is that George met his second wife, Ann Borodell, when he was wounded and took shelter in her father's house. He married her in England and returned to Massachusetts about 1644.<br />

A Brutal Murder<br />
This community was shocked last Monday when the report was flashed around that Frank D. Gooch had been murdered, and on investigation, it was found that the report was true and that he had met death at the hands of Claude Coonse. It seems that Coonse was owing Gooch some money, and last Monday forenoon the latter went to the Turner Ranch, where Coonse was working, to collect the money due him and an argument arose and Coonse knocked Gooch over onto the teeth of a hay buck, face down, and then jumped on the prostrate man, catching him by the head or shoulders, and literally beat his face into a pulp, breaking the jaw bones and all the bones in the face, causing death in a few minutes. Acting on the advise of parties, Coonse came to town and gave himself up to Constable Boston and was later taken to jail at Alturas by Sheriff Sharp. The above are the facts as near as we can get them. There were no witnesses to the horrible tragedy except the little nine-year old son of Mr. Gooch, who had accompanied his father on the trip that ended in his death. An inquest was held by Deputy Coroner Pengelly, of Alturas and the verdict of the jury was that Frank D. Gooch came to his death from a fractured skull inflicted by Claude Coonse. The funeral was held Monday afternoon from the M. E. Church, the services being conducted by Re. Joseph Miller. The church was crowded with relatives and friends who came to pay their last tribute of respect to the murdered man, and the remains were followed to their last resting-place in the Cedarville Cemetery by the large number assembled. Frank Dwight Gooch was born at Reno, Nevada, December 24, 1876, and came with his parents to Surprise Valley two years later. He was married to Katie E. Davidson, January 26, 1907. To this union were born six children, Emma, Clyde, William, Frankie, Catherine, and Delbert, all of whom live to mourn his loss, as also does his father, O. S. Gooch, and two sister, Mrs. Gladys Wentzell and Mrs. Belva Sevier, and two brothers, Guy and Roy Gooch of this place. He united with the Methodist church in 1907 and of which he has been an active member ever since. He died June 16, 1923, at the age of 47 years, 5 months and 8 days. The act of savage brutality that ended the life of Frank Gooch has cast a mantle of gloom over the entire community and the heartfelt sympathy of all go out tot he sadly bereaved wife and little children, and to the sorrowing relatives. As this is a case to be determined by the courts the Record refrains from any comment at this time.<br />

WILLIAM H. SHOEMAKER, 87, a retired professor of Spanish, Italian andPortuguese, died Saturday at Graduate Hospital in Philadelphia. He livedin Pennswood Village in Newtown.<br />
Mr. Shoemaker, a native of Norristown, attended the George School in Bucks County and received a Ph.D. from Princeton University in 1928. He served as chairman of the romance language department at the University of Kansas from 1938 to 1957 and as chairman of the Spanish, Italian and Portuguese department at the University of Illinois from 1957 to 1967. From 1967 until his retirement in 1980, he was a professor emeritus at the University of Missouri.<br />

Mr. Shoemaker spent much time in Spain with Spanish scholars, and he was an authority on Benito Perez Galdos, the most famous Spanish author after Cervantes, his son said. He wrote 15 books on Galdos' work and in 1959, received the Order of Civil Merit, the highest civilian award the Spanish government bestows on foreigners, for expanding Spanish culture.<br />
Mr. Shoemaker was a lifelong member of the Norristown Friends Meeting. He also was a member of the American Association of Teachers of Spanish and Portuguese, the Modern Language Association and the American Association of University Professors.<br />

The Philadelphia Inquirer, 27 March 1989<br />
------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
William Hutchinson Shoemaker was born in Norristown, Pennsylvania, March 21, 1902, and died in Newton, Pennsylvania, March 24, 1989.<br />
During his career of more than fifty years, Professor Shoemaker was associated with four major universities. He received the A. B., A. M., and Ph. D. degrees from Princeton University in 1924, 1928, and 1934, respectively, In 1938 he moved from Prince ton to the University of Kansas, Lawrence, where he assumed the Chairmanship of the Department of Romance Languages, a post which he held for nineteen years. From 1957 until 1969 he was Head of the Department of Spanish, Portuguese, and Italian at the University of Illinois, Urbana, and from 1970 to 1980 he was a Visiting Professor of Spanish at the University of Missouri, Columbia.<br />
Professor Shoemaker specialized in late nineteenth- and early twentieth-century Spanish literature and wrote numerous critical articles and eight books about the works of Pérez Galdós. His best known publication in this regard is perhaps his excellent three-volume study The Novelistic Art of Galdós (1980-82).<br />
In recognition of his achievements as a distinguished Hispanist, he was made a member of the Orden del Mérito Civil in 1959 and a Miembro Titular del Instituto de Cultura Hispánica in 1970. He also served as Vice President of the Central States Modern Language Association in 1949 and he was President of the AATSP in 1949-50.<br />
Dr. Bill Shoemaker, as he is affectionately remembered, was a unique individual who had a special gift for imparting to his students his great love of art and literature. Although he was demanding in the classroom, he was, at the same time, a benevolent and caring teacher who took great pride in the accomplishments of his students. He will be missed, but his presence remains with those of us who had the good fortune to study with him and know him as a colleague and friend.<br />

Shortly after Mr. Hall's death, one of his fellow educators wrote: "He was one of the men engaged in the work of education who gave evidence in his daily life of the very highest ideas of public service. His devotion to the interests of the students was unfailing. He has left an impression, not only on the schools of Concord, but also on those of the State, that will be lasting."<br />

Ivan died of massive heart attack while playing shuffleboard in backyardof home in Rochester, NY.<br />

Ivan Fiske wrote:<br />
  When on the farm, up the West Notch a mile or so, I had assigned chores. Bringing water for the house, feeding hens, gathering eggs, milking, help cutting wood for the stove, helped plant corn and potatoes, pitched hay and drove the team on a hayfork. In the fall, dug potatoes, picked corn and thrashed beans with a flail, one short stick tied to a longer stick (handle) with a leather cord.<br />
  Several summers before leaving for college, I lived at home but worked out. Two summers I worked for a contractor (Mr. Singer) mostly building cement walks for the village of Richburg. All cement was mixed and handled by short handled shovel. The first week I felt like giving up. Worked beside a mature man (Mr. Spears) who had spent several years grading railroad ties, etc. He could handle a shovel. I doubt if there were long handled shovels at this time. By two weeks I could shovel either right or left. Ten hours was a dayʼs work and often we worked twelve to finish the job. No overtime pay.<br />
  Another summer I worked for a farmer on the East Branch, North of Richburg. He was down right tight. He would say to me, "Now while we rest for a moment we will go over and cut a few blocks of firewood." I know he bought brown sugar and mixed it with maple sugar, selling it at maple syrup prices, for maple syrup.<br />
  One summer I worked for Mr. Daugherty an oilman of Bolivar. I believe a father (priest) had an interest in the lease. Father came several times while I was working, breath smelled rather strong of his morning drink. This was heavy work, digging forms in the earth, breaking stones for cement. These large cement foundations were for engine blocks and power wheels used in the oil business. All cement mixing, etc., by hand shovel. They paid me well.<br />
  Another summer I worked on a farm at Myrtle, below Little Genesee, NY. Lived with a farmer, his name, Paris Green. He was Laura Fisk Hasardʼs grandfather, a good man but awful poor in worldly goods.<br />
  Worked for Mr. Kriley away upon a hill west of Richburg. He had a large farm, also oil producer. I used my bicycle to and from work, walked the bicycle half way up to work so I could ride it back at night. Before starting home, I would go over all the nuts and tires. Away I went. Seldom did I meet anyone. Had road all to myself. Some of the pumpers along the road said I rode too fast. But I was cocky and sure of myself. Near the bottom of the hill was a wooden bridge 10 or 15 foot. I know there were times I never touched that bridge.<br />
  Then I pasted and trimmed wallpaper for my father. He paid me well - so well that I missed a year of High School to work with him. He did not approve for he wanted me to get an education. All one summer we worked papering and painting the interior of the Newton House in Bolivar. Went back home only weekends. We lived well that summer at the Newton House. We ate in the dining room and the waitresses seemed to enjoy having me eat. Often I had two or three pieces of pie, etc.<br />
  The summer before I was married I painted houses in Hebron, PA.<br />
  Remember one house owned by Mr. Ball. There is where I picked up a nail in my foot. Bothered me for several weeks. While my parents lived at Hebron I made several cross-country trips to Roulette, PA. Over the hills and farmlands by the way of Crandall Hill. By walking up hill and running down it did not take long to cover 10 or 15 miles.<br />
  One summer while we were home from Bristol, TN, I worked for Father Lyman on the farm, but mostly with Elden Barr on the Roulette water lines and installing plumbing here and there.<br />

Florence Fiske wrote in 1978:<br />
After we were married in Roulette, PA, we went to Alfred, NY, August 29, 1916. Ivan had been teaching there since his graduation from Alfred University in June 1914. We rented an apartment in Phalla Allenʼs house. Ivan continued teaching boys in gym work and boyʼs<br />
hygiene for 2 more years.<br />
After Ivan went to Camp Blufields to learn Army regulations we moved to Bristol, TN where he taught Military Training at Kingʼs College 3 years. Then we moved to Bradford, PA in 1921 were he taught Math in Senior High School, later was Principal of Junior High School. He retired in<br />
June 1952 and we moved to Rochester, NY where we had a house built at 98 El Rancho Drive.<br />

 <br />
William was the son of William III of Aquitaine and Gerloc (Adele) of Normandy. He was brother in law of Hugh I of France, married to his sister Adelaide. William married Emma of Blois. Their marriage was stormy, in part because of William's indulgence in the pursuit of women and wild animals. She banished his paramours, they separated twice for long periods, and finally he retired to a monastery, leaving Emma to rule Aquitaine in the name of their son until 1004.<br />

Almodis de la Marche (c. 1020-16 October 1071) was the daughter of Bernard I, Count of Marche. She married Hugh V of Lusignan around 1038 and they had one son:<br />
    * Hugh VI of Lusignan (c. 1039-1101)<br />
 <br />
Almodis and Hugh of Lusignan divorced due to consanguinity, and Hugh arranged for her to marry Count Pons of Toulouse in 1040. Together they produced several children, including:<br />
    * William IV of Toulouse<br />
    * Raymond IV of Toulouse<br />
    * Almodis of Toulouse, married Count Pierre of Melgueil<br />
 <br />
She was still Pons' wife in April 1053, but shortly thereafter Almodis was abducted by Ramon Berenguer I, Count of Barcelona. He kidnapped her from Narbonne with the aid of a fleet sent north by his ally, the Muslim emir of Tortosa. They married immediately (despite the fact both of her previous husbands were still alive) and they appear with their twin sons in a charter the next year. Pope Victor II excommunicated Almodis and Ramon for this illegal marriage until 1056. Together they produced four children:<br />
    * Berenguer Ramon II, Count of Barcelona<br />
    * Ramon Berenguer II, Count of Barcelona<br />
    * Inés of Barcelona, married Count Guigues I of Albon<br />
    * Sancha of Barcelona, married Count Guillermo Ramon I of Cerdagne<br />
 <br />
Almodis maintained contact with her former husbands and many children, and in 1066/1067 she traveled to Toulouse for her daughter's wedding. A few years before, in 1060, Hugh V of Lusignan had revolted against his lord, Duke William VIII of Aquitaine, in support of Almodis' son William IV of Toulouse. Her sons supported one another in military campaigns; Hugh VI of Lusignan, Raymond IV of Toulouse, and Berenguer Ramon all took the Cross.<br />
 <br />
Her third husband Ramon had a son from a previous marriage, Pedro Ramon, who was his heir. Pedro apparently resented Almodis' influence and was concerned she was trying to replace him with her own two sons. He murdered her in October 1071. Pedro was disinherited and exiled for his crime, and fled the country. When his father died in 1076, Barcelona was split between Berenguer Ramon and Ramon Berenguer, Almodis' sons. The family history of murder did not end with Pedro Ramon, as Berenguer Ramon earned his nickname "The Fratricide" when he killed his own twin brother.<br />

Roger Mortimer (1231-1282), 1st Baron Wigmore, was the son of Ralph deMortimer and his wife, Gwladys Ddu-- daughter of Llywelyn the Great. Hewas a famous and honored knight, and a loyal ally of King Henry III ofEngland. He was at times an enemy, at times an ally, of Llywelyn the Last.<br />
 <br />
Mortimer fought for the king against the rebel Simon de Montfort, 6th Earl of Leicester, and almost lost his life in 1264 at the Battle of Lewes fighting Montfort's men. In 1265 Mortimer helped rescue Prince Edward and they made common cause to lure Montfort into a trap.<br />
 <br />
In August 1265, Montfort's army was surrounded by the River Avon on three sides, and Prince Edward's army on the fourth. Mortimer had sent his men to block the only possible escape route, at the Bengeworth bridge. The Battle of Evesham began in earnest. A storm roared above the battle field. Montfort's Welsh soldiers broke and ran for the bridge, where they were slaughtered by Mortimer's men. Mortimer himself killed Hugh le Despencer, 1st Baron le Despencer. Finally, the royalist forces crushed Montfort's army and killed Simon de Montfort himself. Mortimer was awarded Montfort's severed head, which he sent home to Wigmore castle as a gift for his wife, Lady Mortimer.<br />
 <br />
Lady Mortimer was Maud de Braose, daughter of William de Braose, Lord of Abergavenny by Eva Marshall. Roger Mortimer had married her in 1247. She was, like him, a scion of a Marcher family. Their children were:<br />
   1. Ralph Mortimer, died 1276.<br />
   2. Edmund Mortimer, 2nd Baron Wigmore (1251-1304)<br />
   3. Isabella Mortimer, died 1292. She married (1) John Fitzalan, 7th Earl of Arundel, (2) Robert de Hastings<br />
   4. Margaret Mortimer, died 1297. She married Robert de Vere, 6th Earl of Oxford<br />
   5. Roger Mortimer of Chirk, died 1326.<br />
   6. Geoffrey Mortimer, a knight<br />
   7. William Mortimer, a knight<br />
 <br />
Their eldest son, Ralph, was a famed knight but died in youth. The second son, Edmund, was recalled from Oxford University and made heir. Roger Mortimer died in 1282, and was buried at Wigmore Abbey, where his tombstone reads:<br />
 <br />
    "Here lies buried, glittering with praise, Roger the pure, Roger Mortimer the second, called Lord of Wigmore by those who held him dear. While he lived all Wales feared his power, and given as a gift to him all Wales remained his. It knew his campaigns, he subjected it to torment."<br />

Sikelgaita (1040-April 16, 1090) was a Lombard princess, the second wife of Robert Guiscard.<br />
 <br />
She was the daughter of Guiamarius IV, prince of Salerno. She married Robert in 1058, after Robert divorced his first wife Alberada due to supposed consanguinity. Her sister had earlier married Robert's half-brother Drogo. In 1060 she gave birth to Roger Borsa, and sometime later she gave birth to a second son, Guy, as well as a daughter, Maud, who married Ramon Berenguer II, Count of Barcelona.<br />
 <br />
Sikelgaita frequently accompanied Robert on his conquests. Although at first she tried to persuade him not to attack the Byzantine Empire, she accompanied him on his campaign against them as well. At the Battle of Dyrrhachium she fought in full armour, rallying Robert's troops when they were initially repulsed by the Byzantine army. According to the Byzantine chronicler Anna Comnena, she was "like another Pallas, if not a second Athena," and Anna attributes to her a quote from the Iliad.<br />
 <br />
In 1083 Sikelgaita returned to Italy with Robert to defend the Pope against Holy Roman emperor Henry IV. She accompanied him on a second campaign against the Byzantines, during which Robert died on Corfu in 1085 with Sikelgaita at his side. Supposedly, she tried to poison Robert's son by his first wife, Bohemund of Taranto, although the two eventually came to an agreement by which Roger Borsa was allowed to succeed Robert.<br />

Tancred of Hauteville was a Norman noble, about whom little is known; his historical importance comes entirely from the accomplishments of his sons and later descendants.

He was the first to be called Duke of Brittany<br />
Married Avicia, also known as Hedwig, in 996 (when he was 16?)<br />
 <br />
GEOFFREY, DUKE OF BRITTANY, married Hawise, daughter of Richard I, DUKE OF NORMANDY, and died in 1008, leaving two sons, Alan and Eudon. During their mother's lifetime the two brothers seem to have been joint rulers of Brittany, but on her death, on 21 February 1034, dissensions broke out between them; peace was restored by a settlement under which Eudon received a territory corresponding roughly to the dioceses of Dol, St. Mialo, St. Brieuc and Tréguier, reduced in the hands of his successors to the two last-named dioceses, while Alan retained the rest of Brittany. After the death of Alan in 1040 Eudon seized the government of Brittany to the exclusion of his nephew Conan, who recovered it in 1057. Eudon died 7 January 1079. He married Orguen, whose parentage is unknown. [Complete Peerage X:779-81, (transcribed by Dave Utzinger)]<br />

William de Braose, First Lord of Bramber (d. 1093/1096) was a Norman nobleman who participated in the Battle of Hastings in support of William the Conqueror.<br />
 <br />
De Braose was given lands in southwest England adjacent to Wales and became one of the most powerful of the Marcher Lords.<br />
 <br />
William was succeeded as Lord of Bramber by his son, Philip. William was present for the consecration of a church in his hometown of Briouze (whence the name Braose), France, in 1093, so we know he was alive in that year. However, Philip was issuing charters as Lord of Bramber in 1096, indicating that William died sometime between those dates.<br />

From Wikipedia<br />
 <br />
William de Braose, Fourth Lord of Bramber (1140/1150 - August 9, 1211) at his peak was also lord of Gower, Abergavenny, Brecknock, Builth, Radnor, Kington, Limerick, Skenfrith, Grosmont, and Whitecastle. His rise and fall at the hands of king John is often taken as an example of that king's arbitrary and capricious behavior towards his barons.<br />
 <br />
William was the son of William de Braose, Third Lord of Bramber and Bertha of Hereford, daughter of Miles Fitz Walter, Earl of Hereford and his wife, formerly Sibyl de Neufmarche. From his father he inherited the Rape of Bramber, in Sussex, and through his mother he inherited a large estate in the Welsh Marches.<br />
 <br />
In 1175, William carried out the Massacre of Abergavenny, killing several Welsh princes to avenge the death of his uncle Henry, Earl of Hereford, after having invited them to a feast at Abergavenny Castle. This resulted in great hostility against him among the Welsh, who named him the "Ogre of Abergavenny".<br />
 <br />
In 1199, William fought beside King Richard the Lion-heart at Chalus, where Richard was killed.<br />
 <br />
He was greatly favored by King John early in his reign. John granted him all that he might conquer from the Welsh in Radnor, gave him lordship over Limerick in Ireland (save for the city itself), possession of Glamorgan castle, and then lordship over Gower.<br />
 <br />
In 1203, William was put in charge of Arthur of Brittany, whom he had personally captured the previous year. William was suspected of involvement in Arthur's disappearance, although no concrete evidence ever came to light. There is somewhat better evidence that he at least knew the truth of the matter.<br />
 <br />
In 1206 John gave William the three great castles of Gwent (Skenfrith, Grosmont, and Whitecastle). At this point only an earldom separated him from the greatest in England.<br />
 <br />
But soon after William fell out of favor with the king. The precise reasons remain obscure. John's stated reasons regard money de Braose owed the crown. But the king's actions went far beyond what would be necessary to recover the debt. Instead, he evidently wanted to break de Burgh, and to that end invaded Wales to seize the de Braose domains there. Beyond that, he sought de Braose's wife, who, the story goes, had made no secret of her belief that John had murdered Arthur of Brittany.<br />
 <br />
De Braose fled to Ireland, then returned to Wales as John hunted him in Ireland. In Wales, William allied himself to the Welsh prince Llewelyn and helped him in rebellion against King John.<br />
 <br />
In 1210, William fled in disguise to France and died the following year at Corbeil. William's wife, Maud de St. Valery, and eldest son, William, were captured and murdered by King John, possibly starved to death.<br />
 <br />
While William had aroused the jealousy of the other barons during his rise, the arbitrary and violent manner of his fall very likely discomfited them and played a role in the baronial uprisings of the next decade. The historian Sidney Painter, in his biography of King John, called it "the greatest mistake John made during his reign, as the king revealed to his barons once and for all his capacity for cruelty".<br />
 <br />
Eventually, William's third son, Reginald de Braose reacquired some of his father's titles and lands. The middle son, Giles, was Bishop of Hereford from 1200 until his death in 1215.<br />
 <br />
William also had a daughter, Margaret, who married Walter de Lacy, Lord of Meath.<br />

The following is from a letter written by one of his daughters:<br />
     Carl Henry Falk had many adventures as a sailor. He said when he was a little boy in Sweden, they used to play where they could see the sail boats coming and going. And for several years before he started out, in the morning he wanted to go but by nighttime he was glad to stay home. He left Sweden before his parents (1871) and sailed for over two years. He jumped overboard at a port in France and swam ashore and went thru the gates with the workingmen and went out on another boat.  This was at Xmas time and he only had what he wore.  It was winter and he had no shoes, but a couple of old Scandinavian sailors gave him some of their clothes, and he made a coat out of some old sails.  He visited several African ports and sailed around Cape Horn.  He saw his firs watermelon in Africa.  They grew wild there and the natives brought them to the boat. Most of the sailors were afraid to taste them, but dad and another man ate them.  They were hungry enough to take chances.  Many times they picked worms out of the their bread. He used to think the sailor of today had it pretty soft.<br />
     Once he fell thru a hatch and was knocked out.  When he remembered what had happened he was up in the mast painting.<br />
     He came to Seattle on a sailing vessel when there was only on brick building there and stayed for several months.  But in the meantime his folks had come to Chicago, and he went back to see them.  I am not sure if they were in Chicago yet or if they had gone to Sioux City, but I know he was with them there.  Because we used to love to have him tell us about a fight he had there.  It seems aunt Sophie, Erica and uncle Oscar were going to school and some children made fun of them and kept throwing rocks.  Uncle John and dad were sawing some wood along the riverbank. (I hope there is a rive in Sioux City, Woodbury, IA.)  Anyhow, there was a sawmill there.  Uncle John told them to quit.  Soon the dad [of the rock throwers] came over to uncle John and stated to call him names, so my dad took it up from thereon and made the old man say 'Uncle.'  A crowd of people gather around and yelled: "Give it to him, you big Swede."  He hadn't been a sailor for two years without learning to fight.<br />
     When they moved to Glenwood my dad carried mail from Vermillion to P.O. there. That was where he met my mother.  She was working in a Hotel there and used to ride with him up to Brooklyn to see uncle John Peterson.<br />
     My mother had worked very hard in Sweden and taken care of herself since she was twelve years old.  She tells of working one year for a pair of shoes and board, worked outside everyday but three.  He father died when she was quire young.  She had a young brother August who came over from Sweden by himself when he was a small boy.  He belonged to the first band organized in South Dakota and went to school in this country.  He was killed at Watertown, SD, about 1898 where a brick building collapsed.  You probably remember him better than I do.<br />

EARLY PIONEER LIFE as told by OSCAR SUNDSTROM to Gordon Sundstrom about1933<br />
We came to America, landed in New York, in the spring of 1871. It took us 18 days on the ocean, the last 3 days we were without water for drinking.<br />
From there we went to Grand Rapids, Michigan and then on to Chicago. In the spring of 1872, my father went on to Sioux City, Woodbury, IA, as that was as far as the railroad went. From Sioux City he went up to Dakota and came up to where Glenwood now is and looked at the land. Then he went back to Sioux City and wrote for mother and the children to come, the family consisting of four boys and three girls. The two oldest girls stayed in Chicago and worked. As soon as we came, my father and my three brothers, all being of age then, came up here and filed for the homestead and land for each of the boys. My father took the homestead for me as I was too young - only 7 years of age. This was as far north as the country was settled at that time.<br />
The law was that you had to have some kind of a home built on the land filed within the next 6 months. We made our dugout, which was fourteen feet square, in the side of a hill by the creek which is now called Ash Creek. The roof was out of four studdings with willow branches over the top to fasten the slough hay onto and over that - we put sod.<br />
While we were digging the dugout, an Indian came riding up to us on his pony and stood and looked at us. He tried to make us understand by pointing around. Just as soon as I saw he was an Indian, I made one jump into the hole of the dugout, too scared to stop to see what he would do.<br />
Father bought a yoke of oxen by Elk Point [S.D]. We hitched these steers to a stone boat and on this stone boat were a breaking plow and some grub. I could not ride on these steers. [They] were not broken to drive so had to walk and lead them. My father and I walked all the way up from Sioux City.<br />
We met a man up near the homestead, who had a yoke of oxen. He broke ten acres for us five for my father and five for my brother - for the use of our steers so he could break up land for himself. Father planted sod corn, but got no crop that year. Father and I walked back to Sioux City. [Approximately 50 miles] We walked forty miles the first day to a stopping place, called the Fourteen Mile house. We got to Sioux City early the next morning. Talk about a happy boy and that was me when we were going home to Mother and the others. I was so sure we could walk the whole way down in one day that I kept telling Father to walk faster. He never discouraged me but told me we would see. I slept so hard that Father could hardly wake me the next morning. When he tried to put my shoes on, I woke up as my feet had big blisters on them. I walked barefooted that day and when I got to Sioux City I got a new pair of shoes. They were the prettiest shoes you ever saw, may not have been as stylish as they have now, but they were made without a flaw in my eyes.<br />
We stayed in Sioux City over winter. The next spring [1873] Father bought a pair of ponies, real Indian ponies that we drove when we moved up here. We had a cow that we led with us. There were no roads so we drove angling across the bottom, north of Elk Point. It started to rain and thunder towards evening so we stopped and asked to stay all night but they refused, so we went on. After dark we came to a Norwegian farmer who let us stay there. We stayed there three days - as the bottom was flooded.<br />
It took us two days to get to the homestead. The weather turned real cold and we had cold rainy weather. It being early spring, we had no shelter for the oxen - two ponies and the cow.<br />
My brother took the ponies to a farmer south of us who had a straw barn. To save the oxen and the cow from freezing to death, we took them into the dugout with us [overnight]. In those days the homes were never to small but what there was room for some body else - man or beast - to get sheltered in. They tied these critters to our beds where we slept. Remember now that doesn't mean beds like [we] have now days - just plain straw for mattress.<br />
Father sowed in 10 acres of wheat and broke up forty acres - ten on each quarter to have ready to sow in the spring.<br />
Next came the hardship of getting hay for the five animals. Had to go six miles to a school section northwest of home where there were some sloughs. First there had first choice and by that would hurry and  cut around the patch making it as large as he thought necessary to his full supply.<br />
One farmer had a reaper and cut all of [the] neighbor's grain around while they did the binding. Kept me busy carrying water for the men as sometimes I had a half mile to walk and get the water. My wages were fifty cents a day, providing I got my pay from all.<br />
After sowing in the wheat it was customary to break up "fire guards" as they were called, by plowing around each quarter to prevent prairie fires from burning up homes.<br />
There was not enough grass to amount to anything on the higher levels of ground, only in draws and creeks there would be a little moisture in the soil, could be found a little grass. That meant picketing and herding the stock and naturally me being the smallest, I got the job.<br />
A neighbor helped my father and brothers stack the grain and then they helped him. They got two stacks of grain each so they put them all together to make a "sitting" as it was called so as to save the man who threshed for them from moving his machine twice. That fall after harvesting and stacking, they, father and brothers, built a shed out of poles, willows, and put the threshed straw over it.<br />
The winters were severe, as there was nothing on the bare prairies to stop the snow from blowing around. These snowstorms most generally lasted three days, making them real blizzards. The doors on the dugout had to be made to open inwards, because during these snowstorms the snow would drift up so high that you had to tunnel your way out. It was very difficult to find your way out to the barn to do chores.<br />
The wood supply for winter was hauled from either Vermillion [S.D.] or Elk Point. If you had anything to sell you took it with you and then went to the woods, cut your own wood and drove home. Hauling was surely a nice cold task when the trip was so far. It was not a bit unusual to have to stop at several places to have your frozen limbs thawed out. My mother and I picked leaves and whatever we could find to burn along the creek.<br />
The only flour mills were along the Vermillion River at Bloomingdale and later one a Lodi, which became a country village, consisting of a post office, drugstore, grocery store, blacksmith shop and a saloon. At first we had to go to Vermillion to get our mail. We certainly didn't get our mail every day then as we do now. Later, there was a flour mill at Riverside and then on in Centerville - a little below where Centerville is now.<br />
The common custom of traveling to go and visit the neighbors or friends was to get in and sit in the wagon box as even spring seats were not in style yet. The boys would ride horseback and the girls would walk to go and visit each other, unless the distance was to far. They didn't call it far if it was within five miles. That's what you don't call it even by [can not read the last word].<br />
In the spring of 1874 they put in a crop, and it grew and looked real nice. To our disappointment came the grasshoppers and destroyed the crop. Not only did they come this one, year, but, they came for five consecutive years. Now is when the real hard times came and it looked more discouraging than ever before, as there were no means or credit to get anything. The poor had to stay and the rich were not there. Our meals mostly consisted of homemade hard tack, mush and cornmeal bread. Didn't know of what vitamins we needed or what calories we should have, we were only too glad to get something into our stomachs that would keep us from starving.<br />
In the year 1875 they took apart the house in Sioux City that was made of cottonwood lumber and hauled it up here and rebuilt the house. This house was far from being tight and warm in the winter, but to us we thought it was swell in comparison to the dugout. Many a winter morning we woke up with an extra blanket on - not a woolen blanket, but one of snow.<br />
The first school I attended was in a homestead shanty for only two or three months in summer. Here we learned reading, writing, spelling and arithmetic. Later I went to school in Lincoln County, which is now called Brooklyn school. My friend, James Palmer and  I dug a hole in the side of the creek bank and put up a few poles, made a roof covered with straw which lasted for 2 winters. This was a barn for his team and my team.<br />
Church services were held in houses at first. The nearest church was [in] Dalesburg, [S.D.], later the one in Komstad.[ S.D.]<br />
The first fair held in Vermillion my friend, James Palmer, and I rode horse back down. We had fifty cents each to spend and the fee to enter was a quarter, so didn't have much to spend foolishly. Went home the next day as we had no money, but we were two happy lads just the same.<br />
And the first 4th of July celebration in the north part of the county was at what was called Broad Grove by the Vermillion River. Some came with oxen, some with horse wagons, some on horseback and others on foot. No buggies in sight as they were not in style yet. The lightest traveling vehicle was a wagon.<br />
Grasshopper time made land so cheap, as there was the Black Hills Gold Rush at that time. A few around got excited and sold out to go out there and get rich quick. One man sold his timber [800 acres] that was all proved up, one for forty bushels of wheat and another, his for one hundred twenty five bushels of wheat. Grain must be ever so much higher priced to what it is now or otherwise land was awfully cheap. My sister helped some of these families take up this hard tack bread to take with them as they had a hard journey ahead of them.<br />
Some years later my father and I drove up to Sioux Falls [S.D.] with some hogs. It took two days as we got stuck in the mud. It was a long way to go but we heard prices were best there so that was the reason why. The prices were two cents a pound. I don't see how they could have been much less to be able to sell instead of giving them away. My father and I never expected to get any warm meals. We were supposed to take our own grub with us. In the winter it would freeze so hard we could hardly eat it. There were a few places where one could buy a cup a hot coffee, which was anything but delicious. Our real treat on the homeward trip was a nickels worth of bologna and a nickels worth of sweet crackers, providing you had the dime to buy it with.<br />
In 1876 the Post Office was established on the homestead east of our home, later moving to our home. Here the mail would be distributed, the mail carriers coming over once or twice a week. Many a snowstorm they had to stay over, as they would be snowbound for a couple days at that time.<br />
And on and on the story goes, but from now on each year progressed a little more as gradually the hardships of pioneer life were made easier until up to the present time, where little of that hardship can be realized.<br />

Died very suddenly Monday morning at 4:30 oʼclock, from heart failure and other complications following a sickness of four weeks duration.

He also leaves three brothers and two sisters: Oscar Sundstrom of Beresford, C. H. Falk of Vancouver, Wash., I. J. Sundling, in Sweden,  Mrs. August Soderstrom of Beresford and Mrs. Emanuel Norelius of Vancouver, Wash.<br />
The funeral service were held from the home this afternoon at one oʼclock and at the Brooklyn church at two oʼclock, Rev. Holmes conducting the funeral and assisted by Rev. J. A. Quello.  A large concourse of relatives and friends were present to pay their respect to a kind friend and Christian neighbor and all grieve at the thought of his passing.  The remains will be laid to rest in the Brooklyn cemetery.<br />

It is unclear why and it wasn't until the 90's, my father was reunited with his cousin Elizabeth (Thomas's daughter). Sadly, she would have been a wealth of information but she died too young.

The son of Thomas "The Settler" Dewey & his wife Frances, later the wifeof George Phelps. Dewey married on 6 Nov 1662 at Northampton, MA toHepzibah Lyman the daughter of Richard & Hepzibah Ford Lyman. The Deweyslocated at Northampton, MA about 1663 where Josiah learned thecarpenter's trade and became a freeman in 1666. During King Philip's Warhe was a Sargent of the Guard at Westfield, MA.<br />
He was a Quaker and in his religious discovery he says; "When I was entred into a married state I saw myself now under former ingagemnts of attending heart-searching & hearing Mr. Mather on the hearts hardness assert that there was no plague like unto that, I was affrighted there at & soon after hearing Mr. Eliot (now of Gilford) on a lecture sermon was so awakened as to resolve no longer to delay but to fall to search my own heart. But I found it hard & difficult work to keep my mind to it & sometimes I found that my heart would slip from ye work almost as soon as I was at it. So that I could find little rest."<br />
He seems to have found that rest as he became a Deacon in the church at Westfield. In 1696 he moved to Lebanon, CT where he helped found the town, and where his name appears often in the early records.<br />

Second marriage to Sarah Partridge between 1653 and 1683?<br />
 <br />
Samuel Allen was made freeman in 1683 and was more than 80 years old at his death in 1791, per Savage. Samuel and his wife are mentioned in Winthrop's Medical Journal, his wife of 17 1/2 years, "hath been but half year married, G[oodman] Woodfords daughter." This entry was dated at Northampton 1659, but Jacobus believes it was more likely 1660.<br />
 <br />
"Samuel Allen came to Northampton in 1657. A public meeting of the settlers held Dec. 19, 1657, assigned him a home lot on King street. The house soon reared upon it, having received at intervals many additions and improvements, stood on the left hand corner of what is now called Edwards street, but formerly by name less historic, viz: Back Lane. In 1659, the house being in readiness, he married the daughter of his next neighbor on the south. This homestead remained in the line of his descendants till 1805, a period of 150 years." (from The Allen Memorial, pg. 15)<br />
 <br />
Samuel's will was dated 16 June 1712 with a codicil 3 Jan. 1715. It was proved 16 Dec. 1710 and names his wife to have use of the entire estate or as much as she needs during her life, sons Samuel and Thomas (several pieces of land given to son Thomas descended "to my wife from her father Thomas Woodford dec'd"), children of son Joseph (Noah and Elizabeth), daughter Hannah's children, daughters Sarah Miller and Mindwell, sons Samuel and Thomas executors.<br />

He was the second pastor of the first Independent (Congregational) Churchin London. At that time the King, Charles I, was in a conflict withParliament. Puritans Presbyterians and Independents, all dissenters fromthe Church of England supported Parliament. This conflict led up to theEnglish Civil War. King Charles I would be beheaded in 1649 by forces ledby Lord Cromwell during the English Civil War.<br />
 <br />
As a result of the political conflict between King Charles and Parliament religious dissenters were persecuted. Rev John was imprisoned from 1632 to 1634. While in prison his wife, Hannah House, died. He was banished to America upon his release. He led a group of followers to Scituate, MA. They sailed on 18 Sept. 1634 on the Griffin to Boston Ma. He became pastor of the First Church in Scituate where he remained till 1639 when a dispute split the church. Rev John led a group of his followers to Barnstable Mass., about 40 miles to the south east on the north shore of Cape Cod. Barnstable considers Rev John Lothrop to be its founder and has several references to him on its web pages. His house is now the town library.<br />
 <br />
Rev. John was one of Thomas's sons whom Thomas had educated and thus provided with means of self-maintenance, and, therefore, was excluded from the benefits of his will.<br />
 <br />
Of the early life of Mr. Lothrop little is known. The Rev. Dr. John Lothrop, late of Boston, in a memoir published in the first volume of the second series of the Mass. Historical Society's publications, says that these is "no doubt that Oxford was the place of Mr. Lothrop's public education." He refers to Wood's 'Athenoe et Fasti Oxonienses, published in 1691, as his authority. Wood professes to record the names of those "who have been admitted to one of two academical degree of degrees, in the ancient and most famous university of Oxford." He names "Mr. John Lothrop" not however in the list of those educated at that university. Mr. Savage, who has given much attention to the subject, and has personally examined the records of several of the colleges, says tradition is the authority for the statement that Mr. Lothrop was educated at Oxford. Deane, in his history of Scituate, states that Mr. Lothrop was educated at Oxford. He relied on Dr. Lothrop as his authority, who evidently mistakes the meaning of the passage in Wood's Fasti. John matriculated at Queens College, Cambridge in 1601. He received his Bachelor of Arts degree in 1605 and, in 1607,on his twenty-third birthday, John was ordained a deacon by the Bishop of Lincoln and began service for the Church of England as a curate of Bennington, Hertfordshire. After graduation in 1609 with a Master of Arts degree, John Lothrop was admitted as the perpetual curate in charge of the Egerton Church in Kent,a parish four miles east of Eastwell and forty-eight miles southeast of London. This was the second and last parish in which he officiated for the Anglican Church.  The ancestor of the family wrote his name John Lothropp. All his sons omitted the final p. His son Samuel sometimes wrote his name Lathrop, and many of his descendants in Connecticut and Western Massachusetts so spell the name. In the records we find the name written Lathropp, Lothrop, Lathrop, Laythrop and Lawthrop. In Wood's Fasti the name is written Lathrop and Lowthrope. Calamy, Neal, Crosley, Winthrop and Prince, write the name Lathrop.  In 1624 Mr. Lothrop removed to London, and was chosen the successor of the Rev. Henry Jacob, the first pastor of the first Independent or Congregationalist Society in London. Wood, speaking of Mr. Jacob, says he "was a Kentish man, born in 1563, entered a commoner in Saint Maries Hall<br />

From Wikipedia<br />
 <br />
William Marshal, 1st Earl of Pembroke (1146-1219) was an English aristocrat and statesman. He has been described as "greatest knight that ever lived" (Stephen Langton). Before him, the hereditary title of "Lord Marshal" designated a sort of head of household security for the king of England; by the time he died, when people in Europe (not just Britain) said, "the Marshal," they meant William.<br />
 <br />
When William was about six years old, his father John Marshal had switched sides between King Stephen and Empress Matilda. When King Stephen besieged Newbury Castle John had to give William to Stephen as a hostage for John's keeping his word that he would surrender Newbury Castle. John broke his word, and when Stephen ordered John to surrender immediately or watch as he hanged William in front of the castle, John replied that he could always make another son, and a better one, too. Stephen could not bring himself to hang William.<br />
 <br />
As a younger son of a baron without much to leave him, William learned to make his own way: He was knighted in 1167 and was making a good living out of winning tournaments (which at that time were bloody, hand-to-hand combat, not the jousting contests that would come later); he fought in 500 such bouts in his life and never lost once. As a young knight he served in the household of his uncle, Patrick of Salisbury, 1st Earl of Salisbury. In 1168 his uncle was killed in an ambush, and William was injured and captured in the same battle, but was ransomed by Eleanor of Aquitaine.<br />
 <br />
In 1170 he was appointed tutor in chivalry for Henry the Young King and stood by the young king during the Revolt of 1173-1174; he even knighted the young king during this revolt. However, in 1182 William Marshal was accused of undue familiarity with Marguerite of France, the Young King's wife, and exiled from court. He went to the court of King Henry II that Christmas to ask for trial by combat in order to prove his innocence, but this was refused. A few months later the young king died, and on his deathbed he asked that William Marshal to fulfill his vow of going on Crusade. William fulfilled this promise, crusading in the Holy Land from 1183 to 1186; while there he vowed to be buried as a Knight Templar. Upon his return in 1186, William rejoined the court of King Henry II.<br />
 <br />
He continued to serve the king of England for forty-nine years: through the rest of Henry II's reign, all of Richard I's, all of John's, and three years into that of Henry III. William once came face to face with Richard in battle (when he was rebelling against his father) and could have killed him but killed Richard's horse instead, to make that point clear. He supported King John when he became king in 1189, but they had a falling out when William did homage to King Philip II of France for his Norman lands. William left for Leinster in 1207 and stayed in Ireland until 1212, when he was summoned to fight in the Welsh wars. He witnessed the signing of the Magna Carta in 1215.<br />
 <br />
It was William whom King John trusted on his deathbed to make sure John's nine-year-old son Henry would get the throne. It was William on June 15, 1215 at Runnymede who dealt with the barons who made King John agree to the Magna Carta, and it was William who dealt with the kings of France (Louis VII and Philip Augustus). When they would not take the English king's word, they would take William's.<br />
 <br />
On November 11, 1216, upon the death of King John, William Marshal was named by the king's council (the chief barons who had remained loyal to King John in the First Barons' War) to serve as both regent of the 9 year old King Henry III, and regent of the kingdom. William's first action after being named as regent was to reissue the Magna Carta, in which he is a signatory as one of the witnessing barons.<br />
 <br />
For his service to them, the Plantagenets gave him as his bride (in August 1189, when he was 43 and she 17) the second-richest heiress in England, Isabel de Clare, who had inherited large estates in England, Wales, and Ireland. Her father, Strongbow, had been Earl of Pembroke, and this title was granted to William. They had five sons and five daughters, and every one of them survived into adulthood. Their eldest son William would marry (in April 1224) Eleanor, the nine-year-old sister of Henry III (and daughter of King John).<br />
 <br />
William Marshal's health failed him in February 1219. In March 1219 he realized that he was dying, so he summoned his eldest son, also William, and his household knights, then he left the Tower of London for his estate at Caversham in Oxfordshire, near Reading, where he called a meeting of the barons, Henry III, the papal legate, the royal justiciar (Hubert de Burgh), and Peter des Roches (Bishop of Winchester and the young King's guardian). William rejected the Bishop's claim to the regency and entrusted the regency to the care of the papal legate; he apparently did not trust the Bishop or any of the other magnates that he had gathered to this meeting. He wanted to be buried as a Knight Templar, so he was invested into that order before he died on May 14, 1219 at Caversham, and was buried in the Temple Church in London, where his effigy may still be seen.<br />
 <br />
After his death, his eldest son, also named William, commissioned a biography of his father to be written called L'Histoire de Guillaume le Mareschal.<br />
 <br />

    * William Marshal, 2nd Earl of Pembroke (~1190 - April 6, 1231), married (1) Alice de Betun, daughter of Earl of Albemarle; (2) April 23, 1224 Eleanor Plantagenet, daughter of King John I of England<br />

 <br />
The end of the Marshal family<br />
During the civil wars in Ireland, William, Sr., had taken two manors that the Bishop of Ferns claimed but could not get back. Some years after William's death, that bishop is said to have laid a curse on the family that William's sons would have no children, and the great Marshal estates would be scattered. Each of William's sons did become earl of Pembroke and marshal of England, and each died without issue. William's vast holdings were then divided among the husbands of his five daughters. The title of "Marshal" went to the husband of the oldest daughter, Hugh Bigod, 3rd Earl of Norfolk, and later passed to the Mowbray dukes of Norfolk and then to the Howard dukes of Norfolk, becoming "Earl Marshal" along the way. The title of "Earl of Pembroke" passed to the husband of Joan Marshal's daughter, Joan de Munchensy, the first of the de Valence line of earls of Pembroke.<br />

POLICE CHIEF KILLS FRIEND ACCIDENTALLY<br />
Deceased Name: William Snodgrass<br />
Falls Church, Va., Jan. 26 (AP) -- William Snodgrass, 36, a high school teacher, was accidently shot to death today by his close friend, Maj. E. H. Howe, Falls Church police chief. Snodgrass died of a bullet wound in his abdomen.<br />
The county attorney, Robert C. Fitzgerald, said preliminary investigation indicated Chief Howe was demonstrating to Snodgrass how a proper search of a suspect is conducted. The shooting occurred at a soda fountain.<br />
Fitzgerald gave these other details: Snodgrass, hands raised, was posing as a "suspect." Howe had his left hand on the teacher and his right hand on a gun in his pocket. Apparently as he started to withdraw his hand or the weapon, it fired thru his pocket. Howe was released on $1,000 bond on a charge of involuntary manslaughter.<br />

 <br />
Miles de Gloucester, 1st Earl of Hereford, lord of Brecknock (1100 - 24 December 1143), was the son of Walter of Gloucester, who appears as sheriff of that county between 1104 and 1121.<br />
 <br />
Milo succeeded his father about the latter year. He was high in the service of Henry I between 1130 and 1135, and combined the office of sheriff with that of local justiciar for Gloucestershire. After the death of Henry he declared for Stephen, at whose court he appears as constable in 1136. But in 1139, when the empress Matilda appeared in England, he declared for her, and placed the city of Gloucester at her disposal; he was further distinguished by sacking the royalist city of Worcester and reducing the county of Hereford.<br />
 <br />
In 1141, at Matilda's coronation, he was rewarded with the earldom of Hereford. He remained loyal to the empress after her defeat at Winchester. John of Salisbury classes him with Geoffrey de Mandeville and others who were non tam comites regni quam hostes publici. The charge is justified by his public policy; but the materials for appraising his personal character do not exist.<br />

 <br />
Family and children<br />
 <br />
He married Sybil de Neufmarché, daughter of Bernard de Neufmarché, Lord of Brecon and Nest, granddaughter of Gruffydd ap Llywelyn, in 1121. Their children were:<br />

   4. Mahel of Hereford, died ca. 1164, without issue.<br />
   5. Margery de Gloucester, married Humphrey de Bohun.<br />

From Wikipedia<br />
 <br />
Richard I of Normandy (c.935 - November 20, 996) was the Duke of Normandy from 942 to 996. He was called Richard the Fearless<br />
Birth<br />
 <br />
He was born to William I of Normandy, Duke of Normandy, and Sprota. His date of birth is unknown, but he was still a boy when his father died in 942. His mother was a Breton concubine captured in war and bound to William by a Danish marriage. After William died, Sprota became the wife of Esperleng, a wealthy miller.<br />
 <br />
Life<br />
Richard was still a boy when his father died, and so he was powerless to stop Louis IV of France when he seized Normandy. Richard escaped from his prison at Laon, allied himself with Norman and Viking leaders, drove Louis out of Rouen, and took back Normandy by 947.<br />
 <br />
Marriages<br />
He was first married to Emma of Paris (Duchess of Normandy) in 960. She died after 966, with no issue.<br />
 <br />
According to Robert of Torigny, not long after Emma's death, Duke Richard went out hunting and stopped at the house of a local forester. He became enamoured of the forester's wife, Seinfreda, but she being a virtuous woman, suggested he court her unmarried sister, Gunnor, instead. Gunnor became his bride, and her family rose to prominence. Her brother, Herefast de Crepon, was involved in a controversial trial involving the Cathars. She was, like Richard, of Norse descent, being a Dane by blood. Richard finally married her to legitimate their children:<br />
    * Richard II, Duke of Normandy (The Good),<br />
    * Robert, Archbishop of Rouen, Count of Evreux, died 1037.<br />
    * Mauger, Earl of Corbeil, died after 1033.<br />
    * Robert Danus, died between 985/989.<br />
    * Emma of Normandy, died 1052.<br />
    * Hawise of Normandy, wife of Geoffrey I, Duke of Brittany.<br />
    * Maud of Normandy, wife of Odo II of Blois, Count of Blois, Champagne and Chartres.<br />
 <br />
Mistresses<br />
Richard was known to have had several mistresses and produced childen with many of them. Known children are:<br />
    * Geoffrey, Count of Brionne, (b. ca. 970)<br />
    * Hawise (b. ca. 978), d. 21 Feb 1034. m. Geoffrey of Brittany, Duke of Brittany, (ca. 997), son of Conan I of Brittany, Duke of Brittany, "le Tort", and Ermengarde of Anjou.<br />
    * William d'Eu, Count d'Eu, (b. ca. 985).<br />

he Welsh chronicles state further that his name was Coel Hen Godhebog,which would integrate the two possible names together. Monmouth statesthat Coel, upset with Asclepiodotus's handling of Diocletian's massacres,began a rebellion in the duchy of Kaelcolim (Colchester), of which he wasduke. He met Asclepiodotus in battle and killed him, thus taking thekingship of Britain upon himself. Rome, apparently, was thrilled thatBritain had a new king and sent a senator, Constantius Chlorus, to act asa diplomat to Coel. Afraid of the Romans, Coel met Constantius and agreedto pay tribute and submit to Roman laws as long as he was allowed toretain the kingship of Britain. Constantius agreed to these terms but onemonth later, Coel died. Constantius took Coel's daughter, Helena, andcrowned himself as Coel's successor. Helen later gave birth to a son whobecame Emperor Constantine the Great. Note that the Historia RegumBritanniae is not generally considered historically accurate.<br />
 <br />
David Nash Ford and Peter L Kessler contend that Cole was Coel Hen, High King of Northern Britain who apparently lived around AD 350-420, during the time when the Romans withdrew their forces from Britain. He may have been the last of the Roman Duces Brittanniarum (Dukes of the Britons), and took over the northern capital at Eburacum (York) to rule over what had been the northern province of Roman Britain. Most of the Celtic British kings of north Britain, and many Welsh kings, would trace their descent from him - for example Rheged. He is considered to be the father-in-law of Cunedda, founder of the Kingdom of Gwynedd.<br />

 <br />
William I (c. 1028 - September 9, 1087), was King of England from 1066 to 1087. Known alternatively as William of Normandy, William the Conqueror and William the Bastard, he was the illegitimate and only son of Robert the Magnificent, Duke of Normandy, and Herleva, the daughter of Fulbert, a tanner. Born in Falaise, Normandy, now in France, William succeeded to the throne of England by right of conquest by winning the Battle of Hastings in 1066 in what has become known as the Norman Conquest.<br />
 <br />
No authentic portrait of William has been found. In the patriotic print he is wearing plate armour that was invented generations after his death. He was described as a big burly man, strong in every sense of the word, balding in front but of regal dignity.<br />
 <br />
Early life history<br />
William was born the grandnephew of Queen Emma, wife of King Ethelred the Unready and later of King Canute.<br />
 <br />
William succeeded to his father's Duchy of Normandy at the young age of 7 in 1035 and was known as Duke William II of Normandy. He lost three guardians to plots to usurp his place. Count Alan of Brittany was a later guardian. King Henry I of France knighted him at the age of 15. By the time he turned 19 he was himself successfully dealing with threats of rebellion and invasion. With the assistance of King Henry, William finally secured control of Normandy by defeating the rebel Norman barons at Caen in the Battle of Val-ès-Dunes in 1047.<br />
 <br />
He married Matilda of Flanders, against the wishes of the pope in 1053 at the Cathedral of Notre Dame at Eu, Normandy (now in Seine-Maritime). He was 26, she was 22. Their marriage produced four sons and six daughters (see list below).<br />
 <br />
His half-brothers Odo of Bayeux and Robert, Count of Mortain played significant roles in his life.<br />
 <br />
Conquest of England<br />
Upon the death of William's cousin King Edward the Confessor of England (January 1066), William claimed the throne of England, asserting that the childless and celibate Edward had named him his heir during a visit by William (probably in 1052) and that Harold Godwinson, England's foremost magnate, had reportedly pledged his support while shipwrecked in Normandy (c. 1064). Harold made this pledge while in captivity and was reportedly tricked into swearing on a saint's bones that he would give the throne to William. Even if this story is true, however, Harold made the promise under duress and so may have felt free to break it.<br />
 <br />
The assembly of England's leading notables known as the Witenagemot approved Harold Godwinsonʼs coronation which took place on January 5, 1066 making him King Harold II of England. In order to pursue his own claim, William obtained the Pope's support for his cause. He assembled an invasion fleet of around 600 ships and an army of 7000 men. He landed at Pevensey in Sussex on September 28, 1066 and assembled a prefabricated wooden castle near Hastings as a base. This was a direct provocation to Harold Godwinson as this area of Sussex was Harold's own personal estate, and William began immediately to lay waste to the land. It may have prompted Harold to respond immediately and in haste rather than await reinforcements in London.<br />
 <br />
King Harold Godwinson was in the north of England and had just defeated another rival, King Hardrada of Norway supported by his own brother Tostig. He marched an army of similar size to William's 250 miles in 9 days to challenge him at the crucial battle of Senla, which later became known as the Battle of Hastings. This took place on October 14, 1066. According to some accounts, perhaps based on an interpretation of the Bayeux Tapestry commemorating the Norman victory, Harold was killed by an arrow through the eye, and the Anglo Saxon forces fled giving William victory.<br />
 <br />
This was the defining moment of what is now known as the Norman Conquest. The remaining Saxon noblemen surrendered to William at Berkhamsted, Hertfordshire and he was acclaimed King of England there. William was then crowned on December 25, 1066 in Westminster Abbey.<br />
 <br />
Although the south of England submitted quickly to Norman rule, resistance continued, especially in the North for six more years until 1072. Harold's sons attempted an invasion of the south-west peninsula. Risings occurred in the Welsh Marches and at Stafford. Most seriously William faced separate attempts at invasion by the Danes and the Scots. William's defeat of these led to what became known as the The Harrowing of the North in which Northumbria was laid waste to deny his enemies its resources. The last serious resistance came with the Revolt of the Earls in 1075.<br />
 <br />
William's reign<br />
William initiated many major changes. In 1085, in order to ascertain the extent of his dominion, William commissioned the compilation of the Domesday Book, a survey of England's productive capacity similar to a modern census. He also ordered the building of a number of castles, among them the Tower of London. His conquest also led to Norman French replacing English as the language of the ruling classes, for nearly 300 years.<br />
 <br />
William is said to have deported large numbers of the old landed classes into slavery through Bristol. Many of the latter ending up in Umayyad Spain and Moorish lands, converting and taking high positions in the state.<br />
 <br />
He died aged 60 at the Convent of St. Gervais, near Rouen, France, on September 9, 1087 from abdominal injuries received from his saddle pommel when he fell off a horse at the Siege of Mantes. He was buried in the Saint Peter's Church in Caen, Normandy. In a most unregal postmortem, William's corpulent body would not fit in the stone sarcophagus, and burst after some unsuccessful prodding by the assembled bishops, filling the chapel with a foul smell and dispersing the mourners.<br />
 <br />
William was succeeded in 1087 as King of England by his younger son William Rufus and as Duke of Normandy by his elder son Robert Curthose. This led to the Rebellion of 1088. His youngest son Henry also became King of England later, after William II died without a child to succeed him.<br />
 <br />
Children of William the Conqueror and Matilda of Flanders<br />
Some doubt exists over how many daughters there were. This list includes some entries which are obscure.<br />
   1. Robert Curthose (c. 1054-1134), Duke of Normandy, married Sybil of Conversano, daughter of Geoffrey of Conversano<br />
   2. Adeliza (or Alice) (c. 1055-?), reportedly betrothed to Harold II of England (Her existence is in some doubt.)<br />
   3. Cecilia (or Cecily) (c. 1056-1126), Abbess of Holy Trinity, Caen<br />
   4. William Rufus (1056-1100), King of England<br />
   5. Richard (1057-c. 1081), killed by a stag in New Forest<br />
   6. Adela (c. 1062-1138), married Stephen, Count of Blois<br />
   7. Agatha (c. 1064-c. 1080), betrothed to (1) Harold of Wessex, (2) Alfonso VI of Castile<br />
   8. Constance (c. 1066-1090), married Alan IV Fergent, Duke of Brittany; poisoned, possibly by her own servants<br />
   9. Matilda (very obscure, her existence is in some doubt)<br />
  10. Henry Beauclerc (1068-1135), King of England, married (1) Matilda (or Edith) of Scotland, daughter of Malcolm III, King of Scotland, (2) Adeliza of Louvain<br />

Grave Inscription:<br />
Ebenezer Clewett served as first grand tiler of the Grand Lodge Free and Accepted Masons of Wisconsin from his appointment in 1845 until his death in 1872...<br />
 <br />
Hi Rachel,<br />
My name is Linda Larson. I am Howard Clewett's daughter and the keeper of the records in this family. Dad forwarded The information that I have on Ebenezer is from a photo of his grave marker. His birthdate was listed as March 19, 1799. He died 1 May 1872 and is buried near Middleton, Wisconsin. He was a Grand Mason there at one time and his grave has often been tended to by non family members. I understand that his sword and other memorabilia are stashed somewhere in the smithsonian. Lydia was according to her own account 19 years Ebenezer's junior. They had 13 children. Ebenezer settled in the Madison and Middleton areas of Wisconsin. Rumor has it that Lydia was rather tough. She was known to have run a bear up a tree and kept it there while the boys were hunting. After the birth of the 13th child. They older boys are said to have run Ebenezer off because he kept getting Lydia pregnant. After Ebenezer's death most of the family disbursed. Many of them ending !<br />
up in Southern California. My branch being one of those. Ebenezer emigrated to Montreal, quebec, canada. He married at Barton Church, 4 miles from Hamilton Canada west by the rev George G. Giddies on the 8th of January 1838... this text taken from old family bible. Ebenezer is known to have married before Lydia in London England to a woman named Elizabeth Ralby. They had at least 3 children together and as of yet I have not discovered the reason that he left London... only that family members from England were said to have placed advertisements in the Wisconsin papers trying to locate him and he forbid Lydia from answering any of the inquiries. I have recently connected with others from Lydia's family. Descendants from nearly all of her siblings. I am happy to copy and send whatever information you are interested in. In the meantime. Your name is not familiar in my records. How are you descendant from George? I just looked, couldn't find a Rachel in the bunch. !<br />
Ebenezer's birth and christening I found in church records at an LDS l<br />
ibrary. He christened at Providence Chapel, St. Marylebone, London England on the 15th April 1799. From there I researched through old films until I found his birth. John (hugo) Clewett married Adeliza Holmes at St. George Hanover in London England in 1790. I know I have the exact date down but not in front of me. Adeliza was christened 17 Oct 1770. Her parents were Thomas Holmes and Addiliza Hutchinson. As further proof of this connection Ebenezer named his first child from his second marriage Addelaide and they always called her Addie. She was the only one to remain in the Middleton Wisconsin area when the rest of the family left and her descendants are still there today.<br />
I hope to hear back from you.<br />
 <br />
Sincerely,<br />
Linda Larson<br />

Urien, father of Owain mab Urien, was a historical king of Rheged innorthern England and southern Scotland during the 6th century. He becamethe King Urien of Gore of Arthurian legend.<br />
 <br />
Little of Urienʼs history is known for sure, but it seems that Urien fought against the rulers of the Angle kingdom Bernicia. Early on the relationship between Rheged and its neighboring British kingdoms was erratic, but Urien joined with other northern princes and defeated the rising Angles in several battles. His victories are celebrated in the Book of Taliesin, the supposed author of which served as his bard.<br />
 <br />
According to early Welsh writings he was assassinated at the command of his ally Morcant who was jealous of his success.<br />
 <br />
He had four sons, named Owain, Riwallawn, Run and Pascen, the eldest of which succeeded him.<br />
 <br />
The Legend<br />
Urien remained a popular figure in Wales over the centuries, and he and his son Owain were incorporated into Arthurian legend as it spread from Britain to continental Europe. His kingdom was eventually transferred to the mythical land of Gore, and Kings Lot of Lothian and Auguselus of Scotland are sometimes said to be his brothers. During the reign of Uther Pendragon he marries Arthurʼs sister (often Morgan le Fay, but sometimes another sister is named). He, like the kings of several other lands, initially opposes Arthurʼs ascendance to the throne after Utherʼs death. Urien and the others rebel against the young monarch, but upon their defeat, the rebels become Arthurʼs allies and vassals.<br />
 <br />
His wife is usually Morgan le Fay. His marriage is not a happy one, however, as in one story Morgan plots to take Excalibur, kill Urien and Arthur, and place herself and her lover on the throne.<br />
 <br />
He is always said to be the father of Yvain (Owain), and many texts give him a second son, Yvain the Bastard, fathered on his seneschal's wife. The Welsh attribute to him a daughter named Morvydd.<br />
