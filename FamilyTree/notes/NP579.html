<h2>Notes</h2>
Ethelwulf of WESSEX
<p>
<a name ="I005174"><b>[I005174]</b></a><br />
From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia.<br>
<br>
Ethelwulf was the elder son of King Egbert of Wessex. He was born some time around 800 AD, and succeeded his father as King of Wessex in 839. He fought the invading Danes, whose raids had increased considerably. A major victory for Ethelwulf was archived at "Acleah", probably Ockley. Ethelwulf also defeated Cyngen ap Cadell of Wales together with Mercia. In 855, after his wife's death, he went in a pilgrimage to Rome with a younger son, Alfred. In the return journey in 856, he was deposed by his eldest son, Ethelbald. He died January 13, 858 and was buried first at Steyning and then later transferred to Winchester. The image here is an imaginary portrait drawn by an unknown artist in the 18th century, who probably was the same artist who did many other portraits of other Saxon kings.<br>

Godwin of WESSEX
<p>
<a name ="I015175"><b>[I015175]</b></a><br />
From Wikipedia<br>
<br>
Godwin (sometimes Godwine) (c.1001 - April 15, 1053), was one of the most powerful lords in England under the Danish king Canute the Great and his successors. Canute made him the first Earl of Wessex. Godwin was the father of Harold II and of Edith of Wessex, wife of Edward the Confessor.<br>
<br>
Biography<br>
Godwin was a seventh generation descendant of King Ethelred of Wessex, the elder brother of Alfred the Great. His descendants were passed over in the royal succession, but became prominent nobles in the kingdom. Godwin's father was Wulfnoth Cild (c.983-1015) who was Thegn of Sussex. Wulfnoth led a section of the royal fleet into piracy and as a consequence had his lands forfeited, and was exiled. It was left to his young son, Godwin, to improve the family fortunes after his father's death in 1014.<br>
<br>
Godwin was a major supporter of Edmund Ironside, the son of King Aethelred the Unready. While Edmund was in rebellion against his father, Canute and his army invaded England. Edmund was killed, along with many of his supporters, but Godwin survived and pledged his loyalty to Canute. He became one of Canute's advisors, and accompanied him to Denmark to suppress a rebellion there. In 1022 he married Thyra Sveinsdóttir, Canute's sister. She died soon afterwards, but Godwin continued to gain prestige and in 1023 he was the most powerful earl in England.<br>
<br>
Godwin married again to another Danish noblewoman, Gytha Thorkelsdóttir, granddaughter of the legendary Viking Styrbjörn Starke and great-granddaughter to Harold Bluetooth. The marriage resulted in the birth of many children:<br>
   1. Sweyn Godwinson, Earl of Mercia (c. 1025-1052). At some point he declared himself an illegitimate son of Canute the Great but this is considered to be a false claim.<br>
   2. Harold II of England (c. 1025-October 14, 1066)<br>
   3. Tostig Godwinson, Earl of Northumbria (c. 1026-September 25, 1066).<br>
   4. Edith of Wessex, (c. 1030-December 19, 1075), queen consort of Edward the Confessor<br>
   5. Gyrth Godwinson (c. 1030-October 14, 1066)<br>
   6. Gunhilda of Wessex, a nun (c. 1035-1080)<br>
   7. Ælfgifu of Wessex (c.1035)<br>
   8. Leofwine Godwinson, Earl of Kent (c. 1035-October 14, 1066)<br>
   9. Wulfnoth Godwinson (c.1040)<br>
<br>
On November 12, 1035, Canute died. His kingdoms were divided among three rival rulers. Harold Harefoot, illegitimate son by Aelgifu of Northampton, usurped the throne of England. Harthacanute, legitimate son by Emma of Normandy, reigned in Denmark. Norway rebelled under Magnus the Noble. On 1037, the throne of England was reportedly claimed by Alfred of Wessex, son of Emma of Normandy and Ethelred the Unready and half-brother of Harthacanute. Godwin is reported to have either captured Alfred himself or to have deceived him by pretending to be his ally and then surrendering him to the forces of Harold Harefoot. Either way Alfred was blinded and soon died.<br>
<br>
On March 17, 1040, Harold Harefoot died and Godwin supported the accession of Harthacanute to the throne of England. When Harthacanute himself died (June 8, 1042), Godwin supported the claim of his half-brother Edward the Confessor to the throne. Edward was another son of Emma and Ethelred, having spent most of the previous thirty years in Normandy. His reign restored the native royal house of Wessex to the throne of England. Despite his alleged responsibility for the death of Edward's brother Alfred, Godwin secured the marriage of his daughter Edith (Eadgyth) to Edward in 1045. Godwin soon became the leader of opposition to growing Norman influence as Edward drew advisors, nobles and priests from his former place of refuge.<br>
<br>
Exiled from the kingdom in September 1051 for refusing to punish the people of Dover for a violent clash with the visiting Eustace II, Count of Boulogne, Godwin returned the following year with an armed force, compelling Edward to restore his earldom.<br>
<br>
On April 15, 1053, Godwin died. His son Harold succeeded him as Earl of Wessex, an area then covering roughly the southernmost third of England. Harold later succeeded Edward the Confessor and became King of England in his own right.<br>
</p>
Gytha of WESSEX
<p>
<a name ="I015173"><b>[I015173]</b></a><br />
Gytha of Wessex was one of several daughters of Ealdgyth Swanneck by Harold II, the last Anglo-Saxon king of England.<br>
<br>
According to Saxo Grammaticus, two of Harold's sons and a daughter escaped to the court of their uncle, king Sweyn Estridsson of Denmark. They were treated by Swein with hospitality, while their sister was married to Waldemar, king of Ruthenia. This could be no other prince than Vladimir Monomakh, one of the greatest rulers of Kievan Rus.<br>
<br>
Gytha was the mother of Mstislav the Great, the last ruler of united Kievan Rus. In the Norse sagas, Mstislav is called Harald after his grandfather. The pateric of St Pantaleon Cloister in Cologne says that "Gytha the Queen" died as a nun on the 10th of March. It is assumed that she followed Godfrey of Bouillon in the first Crusade and died in Palestine, most likely in 1098, as a year later Vladimir Monomakh married another woman.<br>

"Being a single man, Francis was invited by a Mr. Thomas of Marshfield to come to new England. He left the toen of Salisbury, Old England and settled in Duxbury where he married Margery by whom he had 5 children." So wrote Hon.  Judge Zebulon West (1707-1770), a grandson of the immigrant in Duxbury, who probably learned these facts from his father, also named Francis (1669-1731), who lived with his father in Duxbury until he grew up. He is spoken of as a carpenter in the Duxbury records, and the Plymouth Colony Records show that he made a pair of stocks for the town of Duxbury in 1640. In 1640 & 1642 he was a member of the Grand Jury. In 1642 he bought a house and land in Duxbury (Millbrook). In 1643 he was on a list of those able to bear arms. He was admitted a Freeman in Plymouth Colony in 1656. In 1658 he was Surveyor of Highways in Duxbury; Constable in 1661; and in 1662, '69, '74, '78, '80 & '81 was a member of the"Grand Inquest". During the last years of his life his son, Peter, took care of him. His estate, which amounted to only 16 pounds, 15 shillings, was given to Peter by the Probate Court.<br>

He was a man of great skill and ability and was the first known physician on Martha's Vineyard.
