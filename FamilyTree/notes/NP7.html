Robert ALLYN
<p>
<a name ="I003944"><b>[I003944]</b></a><br />
"The Great Migration Begins", in its entry on William Allen (migrated in 1624), states on page 32 & 35 that William was probably brother of Robert Allen, of Salem, Manchester, and New Londond, CT. Undoubtedly this is the Robert Allen/Allyn referred to by TGMB. TGMB states that many sources have William born in Manchester, Lancashire in England, but that this is a mistaken association with his residence in Manchester, MA. Since William came over with the Dorchester Company, he was probably from Dorchester in England. The same origin in England would apply to Robert, his brother.<br>

Robert Allyn b. in 1616 in England, d. before Sept. 20 1683 at New London, CT, m. Sarah GAGER, daughter of William, b. in England d. Dec. 5 1685.<br>
<br>
Robert came to America in 1632 going first to Salem, MA where he was admitted to the Church. His brother William had come with him to the New World and they settled in a part of Salem which later became the town of Manchester. He was Constable in 1648 and sworn freeman in 1649. In 1651 he and other members of Manchester and Gloucester emigrated to Pequot (now New London) CT. In 1653, lots were laid out and Robert moved to these quarters in 1656. In 1658, Robert and John Gager were released from their fine for not attending ordinary town training, probably because they lived at such a distance from the center. He was still young enough for military training, this was not usually granted to men under 60. The country in the rear of these hardy pioneers was desolate and wild in the extreme. It was here that the Indian reservation Mashantucket was laid out.<br>
<br>
Robert Allyn and John Gager were so far removed from the town lots as to scarcely be able to take part in its concerns, or share in its privileges, but they appeared, however to still attend the Sabbath meetings, probably coming down the river in canoes. Robert became an original proprietor in Norwich CT and was Constable in 1669. He was in the deeds of Norwich until 1674 when he removed with his family back to "Allyn's Point:, his home about a mile above Gale's Ferry, the Headquarters of the Yale racing crews on the Thames River. Robert conveyed lands to his son John in 1681.<br>
Children probably born in Salem, MA.<br>

<br>
Robert Allyn was in Salem, Massachusetts by 1636. He became a member of the church in 1642 and two of his children, John and Sarah, were baptized a few days later. I think Sarah, at least, must have been born a few years earlier. He moved to Norwich, Connecticut, sometime before 1662, when he was dismissed from the Salem church to the Norwich church. According to Founders and Patriots - Founders of Early American Families, he was in Manchester (formerly Jeffrey's Creek) in 1648, New London in 1651, Norwich in 1660 and back to New London. He was granted land on September 6, 1676, by the town of New London.<br>
<br>
His death occurred sometime before 20 Sept. 1683. His heirs executed a deed on that date saying that they agreed that Thomas Rose should have the property given to him by their father. It appears he only had one son who survived to adulthood. He had at least three daughters and it may be that Thomas Rose was married to another daughter.<br>

<br>
Robert Allyn, the first of that name in this country, was probably born in Manchester, England about 1608. He is known to have lived in Salem. Massachusetts, in 1636, and was admitted to the church there in 1642. He was a proprietor at Jeffery's Creek (now Manchester, Mass.) in 1638 and a constable there in 1648.<br>
<br>
In March, 1651, he emigrated with the Gloucester Company to New London, Connecticut with Rev. Blinman, and was allotted land on Cape Ann Lane. He later, in 1656, obtained a large tract of land on the east bank of the Thames, then called the Pequod river, at a place still called Allyn's Point (about 4 miles above New London on the east side of the river.) This was then in the town of New London but by changes in boundaries it soon became the town of Ledyard. He was one of a company which purchased land in Norwich or "New Norridge" where he was a constable in 1669. He died in 1683 in Ledyard leaving five children by his wife Sarah--a son John, and four daughters--Sarah, wife of George Geer; Mary, wife of Thomas Park; Hannah, wife of Thomas Rose; Deborah, who afterwards married John Gager Jr.<br>
<br>
The farm where Robert Allyn settled and established a trading post is still known as 'Allyn's Point' on the<br>
Thames River, and was still owned and occupied by the Allyn family of the ninth generation.<br>

Secretary of the Connecticut General Court.<br>

<br>
Note: Some say that Robert was son of George Allen who d. 1648 at Sandwich, MA, but George's son Robert, b. abt 1627, died 15 May 1661 (probably unmarried) at his brother's house in Rehoboth, Bristol, MA, age 34.<br>
