"Ed and Lura were married on October 2, 1910 in Fair Grove, MO, north of Springfield, in 'the courthouse the woodchucks ate,' as Ed laughingly put it as we interviewed him Saturday.<br>
Soon after their marriage, the DeGraff's moved to a farm in the Badger area across the state line in Kansas from Carl Junction. They lived there until 1938, when they moved back to Springfield for two years, then returned to this area settling in Asbury for one year. In 1941, they moved to their present. located just west of Stringtown on the Smithfield road.<br>
Nine children were born to Mr. and Mrs. DeGraff, eight of whom are still living. One daughter, Ruby, died in 1954. The other children are: Mrs. Esther Cantrell and Elmer DeGraff of Smithfield; Julius DeGraff of the Mound on Route 1 Carl Junction; Phares DeGraff of Houston, Texas; Mrs. Maxine Richardson of Wichita, Kansas; Mrs. Twyla Dedrickson of Joplin; Harold Dean DeGraff of Seattle, Wisconsin, and Mrs. Alta Barclay of Deming, New Mexico.<br>
Ed spent most of his life on the farm. He said he had one hitch at mining for about four years, but he has always been a farmer at heart. He is now 71 years of age and is confined to his home for the most part as he has suffered from arthritis the past four years. Mrs. DeGraff is now 69 years of age and said Saturday that she reared the family, and for the past 14 years has been employed at the Elder shirt factory here.<br>
One of the biggest events to happen to Mr. and Mrs. DeGraff in recent months was the birth of twin sons to their son and daughter-in-law, Mr. and Mrs. Julius DeGraff. The twins are now two or three months of age."<br>

THE DANCE: JOHANNA BOYCE<br>
<br>
By JENNIFER DUNNING<br>
New York Time, 3 May 1984<br>
<br>
Laws of chance and behavior predicated on them are the subject of ''Facing the Odds,'' a richly textured, funny and poignant performance piece by Johanna Boyce, a leading young post- modernist, that was presented at the Kitchen on Tuesday. Here, for once, was the kind of seamless weave of elements - dance, drama, visual effects and personal history - that performance art is said to be meant to be, and a considered articulation of a whole.<br>
<br>
The piece opens with a formal processional of its five performers, all women and all dressed in nicely tatty evening wear. They walk about a darkened stage as a voice intones fortunes, some of the familiar general kind and some of a quirky specificity very much of this time. In an eerily ritualistic passage, two of the women are helped out of their dresses and are left alone onstage in camisole- style underwear. They engage in a tussling, sensuous duet through which they talk with each other about their fathers and sisters. The offstage voice suggests another question as the dance winds down. ''Annuel, are you close to your sister?'' Cydney Wilkes asks. ''Yeah, I would say so,'' Annuel Dowdell says thoughtfully, and they walk off together arm in arm.<br>
<br>
There follows a very funny sequence in which the voice guides the amusingly forthright Diana McWilliams through a solo that is half card tricks and half storytelling, then nudges Damelia Mujica and Robbyn Scott through a chance-predicting game with toy horses.<br>
<br>
One witty dance passage has its four performers engaged in close- woven, stream-of-consciousness charades. Another is a trio with a curious lack of artifice, as if the performers were engaged in some athletic game for three. Dressed in exotic ragtags designed, imaginatively, by Joan Adele Sweet, the women end the piece in a stately, mysterious formal dance that is much helped by its deceptively simple score by Richard Munson, in which repeated, gently percussive piano tones build to an intricate melodic fabric of sound.<br>
<br>
It is very like Miss Boyce's piece as a whole, on which the performers collaborated. And by the end of the evening, one has a vivid and touching sense of each of the women's personalities. We make the mistake, that backstage voice declares at one point, of thinking that the future depends on the arbitrary past. But the two dissimilar daughter-sisters connect, as do all the women in ''Facing the Odds,'' and make their own history for a few moments.<br>
<br>
The magic effects woven into this purposeful theater-dance piece were created by Michael Canick, and Pat Dignan designed the atmospheric lighting. The program also included ''Bombshells,'' which juxtaposed images of popular dancing with exploding buildings, all filmed from television by Miss Boyce and John Schabel. Like the pair's previous ''Waterbodies,'' the film was a poorly crafted, safely obscure blur.<br>
