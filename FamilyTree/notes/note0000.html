King Edgar (c. 942 - July 8, 975) was the younger son of King Edmund I of England. He won the nickname, "the Peaceable", but in fact was a stronger king than his elder brother, Edwy, from whom he took the kingdoms of Northumbria and Mercia in 958. Edgar was acclaimed king north of the Thames by a conclave of Mercian nobles in 958, but officially succeeded when Edwy died in October 959. Immediately Edgar recalled Dunstan (eventually canonised as St. Dunstan) from exile and made him successively Bishop of Worcester, then of London and finally Archbishop of Canterbury, The allegation that Dunstan at first refused to crown Edgar because he disapproved of his way of life, is a discreet reference in popular histories to Edgar's mistress Wulfthryth, a nun at Wilton who bore him a daughter Eadgyth in 961. Dunstan remained Edgar's advisor throughout his reign, nevertheless.<br />
 <br />
Edgar's reign was a peaceful one, and it is probably fair to say that it saw the Anglo-Saxon kingdom of the English at its height. Although other previous kings have been recorded as the founders of 'England', it was Edgar who consolidated this. By the end of Edgar's reign there was little chance of it receding back into its constituent parts, as it had begun to do during the reign of Edwy.<br />
 <br />
The Monastic Reform Movement that restored the Benedictine Rule to England's undisciplined monastic communities saw its height during the time of Dunstan, Aethelwold and Oswald. However, the extent and importance of the movement is still debated amongst academics.<br />
 <br />
Edgar was crowned at Bath, but not until 973, an imperial ceremony planned not as the initiation, but as the culmination of his reign, a move that must have taken a great deal of preliminary diplomacy. This service, devised by Dunstan himself, and celebrated with a poem in the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle forms the basis of the present-day British coronation ceremony. The symbolic coronation was an important step; other kings of Britain came and gave their allegiance to Edgar shortly afterwards at Chester. Six kings in Britain, including the kings of Scotland and of Strathclyde, pledged their faith that they would be the king's henchmen on sea and land. Later chroniclers made the kings into eight, all plying the oars of Edgar's state barge on the River Dee. Perhaps not, but the main outlines of the "submission at Chester" appear true.<br />
 <br />
Edgar had several children. He died on July 8, 975 at Winchester, and was buried at Glastonbury Abbey. He left two sons, the eldest named Edward, the son of his first wife Ethelfleda, and Ethelred, the youngest, the child of his second wife Elfrida. He was succeeded by his oldest son, King Edward the Martyr.<br />
 <br />
From Edgarʼs death to the Norman Conquest there was not a single succession to the throne that was not contended. Although perhaps a simplification, Edgarʼs death did seem to be the beginning of the end for Anglo-Saxon England that resulted in three 11th century successful conquests, two Danish and one Norman.<br />

Edmund II (c. 989 - November 30, 1016) was King of England for several months in 1016. He was a son of King Ethelred II and Aelgifu of Northampton; Edward the Confessor was his half-brother. He was known as Ironside for his military prowess.<br />
 <br />
He was elected king of England by the population of London following his father's death in April 1016, but his rival, Canute the Great, enjoyed greater support throughout the country.<br />
 <br />
Edmund married Ealdgyth (Edith) of East Anglia (born c. 986), the daughter of Mocar and Edgitha, in 1015.<br />
 <br />
The known children of Edmund and Ealdgyth (Edith) are:<br />
 <br />
    * Edward the Exile "Aetheling" (1016-1057), who was born in Wessex and died in London and who married Agatha around the year 1035.<br />
    * Edmund (born c. 1017 in Wessex). Died young.<br />
 <br />
Edmund II was eventually defeated by the Danes, and was allowed by Canute to keep the kingdom of Wessex, on the understanding that whichever of them survived the other would become ruler of the whole of England.<br />
 <br />
Shortly after making this agreement, Edmund II died, on November 30, 1016, and was buried at Glastonbury. Some say he was stabbed in the bowels while going to the privy.<br />
 <br />
According to legend, Truelove Eyre was King Edmund's grandson, though this is impossible to confirm and many historians doubt that it is true. At the same time, many other historians (and a number of laypeople) say that historical occurences around the time period (the Eyres being awarded lands in Derby by William the Conqueror, supposedly Truelove's cousin) seem to indicate that Truelove was indeed a direct relation of the late king.<br />

 <br />
Elfrida (945-1000, also Ælfthryth or Elfthryth) was the second wife of King Edgar of England.<br />
 <br />
Her father was Earl Ordgar, Alderman of Devon. Before marrying King Edgar, Elfrida was the wife of Ethelbald, Alderman of the East Angles. Edgar had slain Ethelbald, in order to obtain the hand of his widow; and Elfrida appears to have connived at the crime.<br />
 <br />
Elfrida was also party to the murder of her step son Edward the Martyr at her residence in Corfe Castle on March 18, 978. This was to place her 10-year-old son Ethelred on the throne as King Ethelred II of England. Henry of Huntingdon relates:<br />
 <br />
    "[Edward] was treasonably slain by his own family... it is reported that his stepmother, that is the mother of King Ethelred, stabbed him with a dagger while she was in the act of offering him a cup to drink."<br />

 <br />
Edmund I, or Edmund the Deed-Doer (921-May 26, 946) was King of England from 939 until his death. He was a son of Edward the Elder and half-brother of Athelstan.<br />
 <br />
Athelstan died on October 27, 939, and Edmund succeeded him as King. Shortly after his preclamation as king he had to face several military threats. King Olaf I of Dublin conquered Northumbria and invaded the Midlands. When Olaf died in 942 Edmund reconquered the Midlands. In 943 he became the god-father of King Olaf of York. In 944, Edmund was successful in reconquering Northumbria. In the same year his ally Olaf of York lost his throne and left for Dublin in Ireland. Olaf became the king of Dublin as Olaf Cuaran and continued to be allied to his god-father. In 945 Edmund conquered Strathclyde but conceded his rights on the territory to King Malcolm I of Scotland. In exchange they signed a treaty of mutual military support. Edmund thus established a policy of safe borders and peaceful relationships with Scotland. During his reign, the revival of monasteries in England began.<br />
 <br />
Edmund was murdered in 946 by Leofa, an exiled thief. He had been having a party in Pucklechurch, when he spotted Leofa in the crowd. After the outlaw refused to leave, the king and his advisors fought Leofa. Edmund and Leofa were both killed. He was succeeded as king by his brother Edred, king from 946 until 955.<br />
 <br />
Edmund's sons later ruled England as:<br />
 <br />
    * Edwin of England, King from 955 until 957, king of only Wessex and Kent from 957 until his death on October 1, 959.<br />
    * Edgar of England, king of only Mercia and Northumbria from 957 until his brother's death in 959, then king of England from 959 until 975.<br />

Ethelred II (Old English: Æelred) (c. 968 - April 23, 1016), known as the Unready, was a King of England (978 - 1013, and 1014 - 1016).<br />
 <br />
According to William of Malmesbury, Ethelred defecated in the baptismal font as a child, which led St. Dunstan to prophesy that the English monarchy would be overthrown during Ethelred's reign. This story is, however, almost certainly a fabrication.<br />
 <br />
Ethelred succeeded to the throne aged about 10 following the death of his father King Edgar and subsequent murder of his half-brother Edward the Martyr. His nickname "The Unready" does not mean that he was ill-prepared, but derives from the Anglo-Saxon unræd meaning "without counsel" or "indecisive". This is also a pun on his name, Æelræd, which means "Well advised".<br />
 <br />
Ethelred had at least sixteen children from two marriages, the first to Ælfgifu, the daughter of Thored, the ealdorman of Northumbria and the second, in 1002, to Emma of Normandy, whose grandnephew, William I of England, would later use this relationship as the basis of his claim on the throne.<br />
 <br />
England had experienced a long period of peace after the reconquest of the Danelaw in the first half of the 10th Century. However in 991 Ethelred was faced with a Viking fleet larger than any since Guthrum's "Summer Army" a century earlier. This fleet was led by Olaf Trygvasson, a Norwegian with ambitions to reclaim his country from under Danish domination. After initial military setbacks including the defeat of his Ealdorman Birhtnoth at the Battle of Maldon, Ethelred was able to come to terms with Olaf, who returned to Norway to gain his kingdom with mixed success. While this arrangement won him some respite, England faced further depredations from Viking raids. Ethelred fought these off, but in many cases followed the practice of earlier kings including Alfred the Great in buying them off by payment of what was to become known as Danegeld.<br />
 <br />
Ethelred ordered the massacre of the Danes living in England on St Brice's Day (November 13) 1002, in response to which Sweyn Haraldsson started a series of determined campaigns to conquer England. In this he succeeded, but after his victory, he lived for only another five weeks.<br />
 <br />
In 1013, Ethelred fled to Normandy, seeking protection by his brother-in-law, Robert of Normandy, when England was over-run by Sweyn Haraldsson of Denmark and his forces. He returned in February, 1014, following the death of Sweyn Haraldsson. Ethelred died on April 23, 1016, in London, where he was buried. He was succeeded by his son, Edmund II of England.<br />
 <br />
Despite the steady stream of viking attacks, Ethelred's reign was far from the disaster described by chroniclers writing well after the event. Ethelred introduced major reforms of the machinery of government in Anglo-Saxon England, and is responsible for the introduction of Shire Reeves or Sheriffs. The quality of the coinage, always a good indicator of the prevailing economic conditions, remained very high during his reign.<br />

PARYSEK, Elizabeth (Liddy) Ann-- departed this life on November 4, 2002.Born in Washington, D.C. August 27, 1940 to a Navy family, she lived invarious places all over the country until moving to Santa Clara in 1954.She has since considered it to be her home town. She is survived by herhusband of 32 years, Joseph H. Parysek, and their children: Michael JamesParysek (Peggy), Amy Katherine Kelley (Reggie), Ellen Rebecca Rosbrugh(Daniel), Michael Joseph Parysek, Karen Doris Jean Lycett, Linda ReneeCooper (Michael), David Henry Parysek (Barbara), Timothy Paul Parysek(Shirley), 17 grandchildren and 7 great-grandchildren.<br />
Liddy worked at Kaiser Santa Clara for over 25 years, and volunteered and worked for the Santa Clara School District as a substitute librarian for several years. She was an active member of the Santa Clara Church of the Nazarene. Liddy enjoyed gardening, reading, crochet, travel and spending time with family and friends.<br />
After battling breast cancer in 1999 she was again diagnosed with liver cancer in 2001; just a month before her daughters wedding. Despite the bleak outlook, she never let it get her down. She made her time count. Early on, she decided that quality was more important than quantity; and her positive attitude allowed her both.<br />
She astounded her doctors by outliving their expectations by more than a year, and used that time to make as many good memories for those who knew and loved her. She was "mom" to many, her generous spirit touched the lives of all who knew her, and she will be greatly missed.<br />
A memorial service will be held on Saturday, November 9th at Central Church of the Nazarene, 3275 Williams Rd., in San Jose at 1:00 p.m.<br />

Aelgifu (also called Aelfgifu or Elgifu) was the wife of Ethelred the Unready of England in the 10th and 11th centuries.<br />
 <br />
Little is known about her except her marriage to Ethelred. Among their children was the future Edmund II Ironside. She died in 1002, and Ethelred then married Emma of Normandy.<br />
 <br />
Canute the Great, who married Emma when Ethelred was deposed, had a mistress who was also named Elgifu, although she was not the same Elgifu that had been married to Ethelred. With this Elgifu, Canute had a son, Harold, who later became Harold I of England.<br />

"Ed and Lura were married on October 2, 1910 in Fair Grove, MO, north ofSpringfield, in 'the courthouse the woodchucks ate,' as Ed laughingly putit as we interviewed him Saturday.<br />
Soon after their marriage, the DeGraff's moved to a farm in the Badger area across the state line in Kansas from Carl Junction. They lived there until 1938, when they moved back to Springfield for two years, then returned to this area settling in Asbury for one year. In 1941, they moved to their present. located just west of Stringtown on the Smithfield road.<br />
Nine children were born to Mr. and Mrs. DeGraff, eight of whom are still living. One daughter, Ruby, died in 1954. The other children are: Mrs. Esther Cantrell and Elmer DeGraff of Smithfield; Julius DeGraff of the Mound on Route 1 Carl Junction; Phares DeGraff of Houston, Texas; Mrs. Maxine Richardson of Wichita, Kansas; Mrs. Twyla Dedrickson of Joplin; Harold Dean DeGraff of Seattle, Wisconsin, and Mrs. Alta Barclay of Deming, New Mexico.<br />
Ed spent most of his life on the farm. He said he had one hitch at mining for about four years, but he has always been a farmer at heart. He is now 71 years of age and is confined to his home for the most part as he has suffered from arthritis the past four years. Mrs. DeGraff is now 69 years of age and said Saturday that she reared the family, and for the past 14 years has been employed at the Elder shirt factory here.<br />
One of the biggest events to happen to Mr. and Mrs. DeGraff in recent months was the birth of twin sons to their son and daughter-in-law, Mr. and Mrs. Julius DeGraff. The twins are now two or three months of age."<br />

Hugh (1286 - November 26, 1326) was sometimes referred to as "the younger Despenser". He was the son and heir of Hugh le Despenser, Earl of Winchester, by Isabel Beauchamp, daughter of William de Beauchamp, 9th Earl of Warwick.<br />
 <br />
He was knight of Hanley Castle, Worcestershire, King's Chamberlain, Constable of Odiham Castle, Keeper of the castle and town of Dryslwyn, and Cantref Mawr, Carmarthenshire, Keeper of the castle and town of Portchester, Keeper of the castle, town and barton of Bristol. He was also Keeper of the castles, manor, and lands of Brecknock, Hay, cantref Selyf, etc., co. Brecon, and Huntington, Herefordshire.<br />
 <br />
In May 1306 Hugh was knighted, and that summer he married Eleanor de Clare, a granddaughter of King Edward I of England. Her grandfather owed Hugh's father vast sums of money, and the marriage was intended as a payment of these debts. When Eleanor's brother was killed at the Battle of Bannockburn, she unexpectedly became one of the three co-heiresses to the rich Gloucester earldom, and in her right Hugh inherited Glamorgan and other properties. In just a few short years Hugh went from a landless knight to one of the wealthiest magnates in the kingdom.<br />
 <br />
Eleanor was also the niece of the new king, Edward II of England, and this connection brought Hugh closer to the English royal court. He joined the baronial opposition to Piers Gaveston, the king's favorite, and Hugh's brother-in-law, as Gaveston was married to Eleanor's sister. Eager for power and wealth, Hugh seized Tonbridge Castle in 1315. The next year he murdered Llywelyn Bren, a Welsh hostage in his custody.<br />
 <br />
Hugh Despenser became royal chamberlain in 1318. As a royal courtier, Hugh manoeuvred into the affections of King Edward, displacing the previous favorite, Roger d'Amory. By 1320 his tyranny was running free. Hugh seized the Welsh lands of his wife's inheritance, ignoring the claims of his two brothers-in-law. He forced Alice de Lacy, Countess of Lincoln, to give up her lands, cheated his sister-in-law Elizabeth de Clare out of Gower and Usk, and had Lady Baret's arms and legs broken until she went insane. He also vowed to be revenged on Roger Mortimer because Mortimer's grandfather had murdered Hugh's grandfather, and once stated that he regreted he could not control the wind. By 1321 he had earned many enemies in every strata of society, from Queen Isabella to the barons to the common people. There was even a bizarre plot to kill Hugh by sticking pins in a wax likeness of him.<br />
 <br />
Finally the barons prevailed upon King Edward and forced Hugh and his father into exile in 1321. His father fled to Bordeaux, and Hugh became a pirate in the English channel, "a sea monster, lying in wait for merchants as they crossed his path". The pair returned the next year and King Edward quickly reinstated Hugh as royal favorite. His time in exile had done nothing to quell his greed, his rashness, or his ruthlessness. Queen Isabella fled to France, where she formed a liaison with Roger Mortimer and began planning an invasion. Hugh tried to bribe French courtiers to assassinate Queen Isabella. This plan failing, he instead arranged for the death of Mortimer's uncle, Roger Mortimer of Chirk, who was in his custody. When Mortimer and the queen invaded, King Edward was desposed, Hugh's father was executed, and Hugh himself was captured.<br />
 <br />
Hugh tried to starve himself before his trial, but face trial he did on November 24, 1326. He was judged a traitor and a thief, was drawn and quartered, and his testicles were severed and burnt before him. He was beheaded, and his head was mounted on the gates of London.<br />

 <br />
Philip I (French: Philippe Ier) (May 23, 1052 - July 29, 1108) was King of France.<br />
 <br />
A member of the Capetian Dynasty, Philippe was born on May 23, 1052, the son of Henri I (1008-1060) and Princess Anne of Kiev (1024 - 1075). His name (derived from the Greek Philippos, "lover of horses") was rather exotic for Western Europe at the time; it was bestowed upon him by his Russian mother. Although he was crowned king at the age of seven, until 1066 his mother acted as Regent, the first queen ever to do so.<br />
 <br />
Philippe's first marriage was in 1072 to Bertha, daughter of Floris I Count of Holland (1055-July 30, 1094). Their children were:<br />
   1. Constance (1078 - c. 1125) married to Hugh of Troyes (Hugh I, count of Champagne) before 1097 and then, after her divorce, to Bohemund I of Antioch in 1106.<br />
   2. King Louis VI of France (December 1, 1081 - August 1, 1137)<br />
 <br />
Although the marriage produced the necessary heir, Philippe fell in love with Bertrade de Montfort, the wife of Count Fulk IV of Anjou. He repudiated Bertha and married Bertrade on May 15, 1092. In 1094, he was excommunicated by Hugh, bishop of Lyon for the first time; after long silence, Pope Urban II repeated the excommunication at the council of Clermont in November 1095. Several times the ban was lifted as Philippe promised to part with Bertrade, but he always returned to her, and after 1104, the ban was not repeated. In France, the king was opposed by Bishop Ivo of Chartres, a famous canonist.<br />
 <br />
The children of Philippe and Bertrade were:<br />
   1. Philippe, Comte de Mantes (c. 1093 [?] - 1123)<br />
   2. Fleury, seigneur de Nagis (1095 [?] - 1118)<br />
   3. Cécile (1097 - 1145), married Tancred, Prince of Galilee; married secondly Pons of Tripoli<br />
   4. Eustachie (c. 1095-?), married Jean, Comte d'Etampes<br />
 <br />
Philippe appointed Alberic, the first Constable of France in 1060. A great part of Philippe's reign, like his father's, was spent putting down revolts by his power-hungry vassals. In 1077, he made peace with William I of England (Duke of Normandy) who gave up attempting the conquest of Brittany. In 1082, Philippe expanded his empire with the annexation of Vexin, then in 1100, he took control of Bourges.<br />
 <br />
It was during Philippe's time that the First Crusade was launched in 1095 which he at first did not personally support because of his conflict with Urban II. Urban would not have allowed him to participate anyway, as he had reaffirmed Philippe's excommunication at the Council of Clermont before he called for the Crusade. Philippe's brother Hugh of Vermandois, however, was a major participant.<br />
 <br />
King Philippe I died in the castle at Melun on July 29, 1108 and was buried at the monastery of Saint-Benôıt-sur-Loire -- and not in St Denis with almost all Capetian kings. According to Abbot Suger:<br />
 <br />
    "...King Philippe daily grew feebler. For after he had abducted the Countess of Anjou, he could achieve nothing worthy of the royal dignity; consumed by desire for the lady he had seized, he gave himself up entirely to the satisfaction of his passion. So he lost interest in the affairs of state and, relaxing too much, took no care for his body, well-made and handsome though it was. The only thing that maintained the strength of the state was the fear and love felt for his son and successor. When he was almost sixty, he ceased to be king, breathing his last breath at the castle of Melun-sur-Seine, in the presence of the [future king] Louis... They carried the body in a great procession to the noble monastery of St-Benôıt-sur-Loire, where King Philippe wished to be buried; there are those who say they heard from his own mouth that he deliberately chose not to be buried among his royal ancestors in the church of St. Denis because he had not treated that church as well as they had, and because among so many noble kings his own tomb would not have counted for much."<br />
 <br />
He was succeeded by his son, Louis VI whose succession was, however, not uncontested.<br />

Eleanor de Clare (1292 - June 30, 1337) was the eldest daughter of Gilbert de Clare, 7th Earl of Hertford and 3rd Earl of Gloucester, and Joan of Acre. With her sisters, Elizabeth de Clare and Margaret de Clare, she inherited her father's estates after the death of her brother, Gilbert de Clare, 4th Earl of Gloucester.<br />
 <br />
She was born at Caerphilly, Glamorgan, and married, at Westminister, shortly after 14 June 1306, Hugh the younger Despenser, of Hanley Castle, the son of Hugh le Despenser, Earl of Winchester by Isabel Beauchamp, daughter of William de Beauchamp, 9th Earl of Warwick. Her grandfather, King Edward I of England, granted Eleanor a maritagium of 2,000 pounds sterling. Eleanor and Hugh would have ten children:<br />
   1. Hugh le Despenser III (1308-1349)<br />
   2. Gilbert le Despenser, died 1381.<br />
   3. Edward le Despenser, died 1342.<br />
   4. John le Despenser, died June 1366.<br />
   5. Isabel le Despenser (1312-1356), married Richard Fitzalan, 10th Earl of Arundel<br />
   6. Eleanor le Despenser, died after 1351, nun at Semplingham Priory<br />
   7. Joan le Despenser, died 1384, nun at Shaftesbury Abbey<br />
   8. Margaret le Despenser, died 1337, nun at Whatton Priory<br />
   9. Elizabeth le Despenser, born 1325, married Maurice de Berkeley, 4th Baron Berkeley.<br />
 <br />
Eleanor's husband rose to prominence as the new favorite of King Edward II of England, who was also Eleanor's uncle. The king strongly favored Hugh and Eleanor, visiting them often and granting them many gifts. One foreign chronicler even alleged that Edward was involved in a ménage à trois with his niece and her husband. Whatever the truth, Eleanor's fortunes changed drastically after the invasion of Queen Isabella and Roger Mortimer. Hugh le Despenser was executed, and she was imprisoned in 1326. She was confined to the Tower of London and Devizes Castle until she signed away her share of the lucrative Clare inheritance to Queen Isabella's paramour, Roger Mortimer. She was accused of stealing back many of Despenser's confiscated items from the Tower of London. Finally in 1328 Eleanor was allowed possession of her own lands, for which she did homage.<br />
 <br />
The Despenser family's fortunes were ruined with the executions of Eleanor's husband and father-in-law. Her sons lost their inheritance, and three of her daughters were forcibly veiled as nuns. Only the eldest daughter, Isabel, and the youngest daughter, Elizabeth, escaped the nunnery, Isabel because she was already married and Elizabeth on account of her infancy.<br />
 <br />
Eleanor was abducted from Hanley Castle in January 1329 by William de la Zouche. This earned them the ire of Sir John Grey, 1st Baron Grey who was contracted to marry Eleanor. Lord Grey was still attempting to claim Eleanor in 1333. In addition, Eleanor was imprisoned again and fined for marrying without royal permission. Her lands were restored soon thereafter and she was reunited with her new husband, but they never did pay the fine. Eleanor and William had one child:<br />
   1. William de la Zouche, born 1330, died after 1360, a monk at Glastonbury Abbey.<br />
 <br />
Eleanor died at Tewkesbury, Gloucestershire, England.<br />

John de Warenne (June 30, 1286-June 1347), 8th Earl of Surrey or Warenne,was the last Warenne earl of Surrey.<br />
 <br />
He was the son of William de Warenne, the only son of John de Warenne, 7th Earl of Surrey. His mother was Joanna, daughter of Robert de Vere, 5th Earl of Oxford.<br />
 <br />
Warenne was only six months old when his father died, and was 7 years old when his mother died. He succeeded his grandfather as earl when he was 19.<br />
 <br />
He was one of the great nobles offended by the rise of the Edward II's favorite Piers Gaveston, and help secure Gaveston's 1308 banishment. The two were somewhat reconciled after Gaveston's return the next year, but in 1311 Warenne was one of the nobles who captured Gaveston. He was however unhappy about Gaveston's execution at the behest of the earl of Warwick, which pushed him back into the king's camp.<br />
 <br />
The baronial opposition was led by the king's cousin Thomas, Earl of Lancaster, and he and Warenne became bitter enemies. Private war erupted between the two, and over the new few years Warenne lost a good part of his estates to Lancaster.<br />
 <br />
Warenne was one of the four earls who captured the two Roger Mortimers, and in 1322 he was one of the nobles who condemned to death the earl of Lancaster.<br />
 <br />
Warenne and his brother-in-law Edmund Fitzalan, 9th Earl of Arundel were the last two earls to remain loyal to Edward II after the rise to power of Queen Isabella and Roger Mortimer. After Arundel's execution he went over to the queen's side, urging Edward II's abdication in 1327.<br />
 <br />
He was the guardian of his cousin Edward Balliol, and after Balliol lay claim to the Scottish throne, accompanied him on his campaign in Lothian. Balliol created Warenne earl of Strathern, but this was in name only for the properties of the earldom were held by another claimant.<br />
 <br />
On May 25, 1306 Warenne married Jeanne of Bar, daughter of count Henry III of Bar and Eleanor, eldest daughter of king Edward I of England. The two were soon estranged and live apart, and had no children, though the marriage was never dissolved. Warenne instead took up with Matilda de Nerford, by whom he had several illegitimate children, and later with Isabella Holland, sister of Thomas Holand, later earl of Kent.<br />
 <br />
Warenne died in 1347 and is buried at the monastery of Lewes. He was succeeded as earl by his nephew Richard Fitzalan, who was also earl of Arundel.<br />

Sir Hugh (1223-August 4, 1265) was an important ally of Simon de Montfortduring the reign of Henry III. He served briefly as Justiciar of Englandin 1260 and as Constable of the Tower of London.<br />
 <br />
He was summoned to Parliament by Simon de Montfort, and so might be deemed a baron, though the legality of that assembly is doubtful. He remained allied with Montfort to the end, and was present at the Battle of Lewes. He was killed fighting on de Montfort's side at the Battle of Evesham. He was slain by Roger Mortimer, 1st Baron Wigmore; this caused a feud to begin between the Despenser and Mortimer families.<br />
 <br />
By his wife, Aline Bassett, he was father of Hugh the elder Despenser.<br />

Hugh (1262-1326), son of Hugh le Despenser II, sometimes referred to as"the elder Despenser", was for a time the chief adviser to King Edward IIof England.<br />
 <br />
He was created a baron by writ of summons to Parliament in 1295. He was one of the few barons to remain loyal to Edward during the controversy regarding Piers Gaveston. Despenser became Edward's loyal servant and chief administrator after Gaveston was executed in 1312, but the jealousy of other barons led to his being exiled along with his son in 1321, when Edmund de Woodstoke replaced him as Lord Warden of the Cinque Ports.<br />
 <br />
Edward found it difficult to manage without them, and recalled them to England a year later, an action which enraged the queen, Isabella, the more so when Despenser was created Earl of Winchester. When Isabella and her lover, Roger Mortimer, led a rebellion against the king, both Despensers were captured and executed. The elder Despenser was hanged at Bristol on October 27, 1326.<br />

Up in the northern part of Sweden near the Artic Circle there are three large rivers that traverse that country in a southeasterly direction and empty into the Gulf of Bothnia.  Their names are Tornea, Lulea and Pitea.  Three cities of the same names are found where the respective rivers lose their identity in that mighty gulf.<br />
Numerous people from the Lulea district immigrated to the Unites States during the early '70s and settled in the northeastern part of Glenwood township, Clay county, and in the eastern and southern part of Brooklyn township, Lincoln county, across the line from Clay.  The Sundstrom ant the Soderstrom families, who settled there, were all related in one way or another and they in turn intermarried with the Olof Linds, the Norins and Heglin families, and today their descendants number perhaps hundreds.  On last Thursday, March 16, one of the largest funerals took place in the Brooklyn church, northwest of Beresford.  It was that of N. J. Sundstrom, a resident of Brooklyn township since 1888, who died Sunday afternoon, March 12, after an illness of only a couple weeks, pneumonia being the cause of death.  Services were conducted by pastor of the church, Rev. Glen Nelson, assisted by Rev. Fred Nelson, in the Swedish language.  The church was filled to overflowing.  Interment was made in the Brooklyn cemetery.<br />
N. J. Sundstrom was born Oct. 14, 1862, in Lulea district in Sweden, and came to this country in 1880, landing first in Indiana where he remained until in 1883 when a sister and two brothers arrived and they came to Dakota, where the deceased homesteaded in Douglas county.<br />
His father and mother arrived here later, as well as his other sisters, in all seven brothers and four sisters.  In 1886 he purchased the farm where he lived until death.  In 1895 he was united in marriage to Adina Soderstrom of Glenwood township, who with a daughter and three grandchildren besides a host of relatives and friends mourn the snatching away of a man known far and wide in these parts of the country.  N. J. was one of the foremost to organize and promote the Brooklyn congregation of the Swedish Mission church and particularly of the building of the present church edifice, a brick structure in 1917, one of the largest county churches in this part of the state.  He was a man known for his kind and upright dealings with his fellowman, of exemplary habits and friend to all who came within his sphere of influence.  The immediate friends and the community in which he lived will experience a vacant space by his departure.<br />

Henry Plantagenet, 3rd Earl of Leicester (1281 - September 22, 1345) wasan English nobleman, one of the principals behind the deposition ofEdward II.<br />
 <br />
He was the younger son of Blanche of Artois and Edmund Crouchback, 1st Earl of Lancaster, Earl of Leicester, who was a son of Henry III of England and Eleanor of Provence.<br />
 <br />
Henry's elder brother Thomas, 2nd Earl of Lancaster succeeded their father in 1296, but Henry was summoned to Parliament on February 6, 1298/99 by writ directed Henrico de Lancastre nepoti Regis, by which he is held to have become Lord Lancaster. He took part in the siege of Carlaverock in July 1300.<br />
 <br />
Thomas was convicted of treason, executed and his lands and titles forfeited in 1322. But Henry, who had not participated in his brother's rebellion, petitioned for his brother's lands and titles, and on March 29, 1324 he was invested as Earl of Leicester, and a few years later the earldom of Lancaster was also restored to him.<br />
 <br />
On the Queenʼs return to England with Roger Mortimer, 1st Earl of March in September 1326, Henry joined her party against Edward II, which led to a general desertion of the kingʼs cause and overturned the power of Hugh le Despenser, 1st Earl of Winchester and his namesake son Hugh the younger Despenser. He was sent in pursuit and captured the king at Neath. He was appointed to take charge of the King, and was responsible for his custody at Kenilworth Castle.<br />
 <br />
After Edward II's death Henry was appointed guardian of the new king Edward III of England, and was also appointed captain-general of all the King's forces in the Scottish marches.<br />
 <br />
In about the year 1330, he became blind.<br />
 <br />
He was succeeded as Earl of Lancaster and Leicester by his eldest son, Henry of Grosmont, who subsequently became Duke of Lancaster.<br />
 <br />
He married once, to Maud Chaworth, before 2 March 1296/1297. (Some references claim he married Alix de Joinville, but she in fact married Henry's brother John.) With Maud he had seven children:<br />
    * Henry of Grosmont, 1st Duke of Lancaster, (about 1300-1360/61)<br />
    * Blanche of Lancaster, (about 1305 - 1380)<br />
    * Maud of Lancaster, (about 1310-1377)<br />
    * Joan of Lancaster, (about 1312-1345)<br />
    * Isabel of Lancaster, Abbess of Ambresbury, (about 1317-after 1347)<br />
    * Eleanor of Lancaster, (about 1318-1371/72)<br />
    * Mary of Lancaster, (about 1320-1362), who married Henry, 3rd Baron Percy and was the mother of Henry Percy, 1st Earl of Northumberland.<br />
 <br />
He was born in Grosmont Castle, Monmouthshire and died in Leicester, England. He is interred at Newark Abbey, Leicester.<br />

POCASSET - Phyllis was born to parents Charles Marshall Fosgate Sr. andEdna Steele Fosgate in Cambridge. She passed away peacefully Friday,November 19, 2010, at her daughter's home in Charlotte, North Carolina.She was 88 and a native daughter and great-granddaughter of Cambridge.Educated at Cambridge Latin and a graduate of Tufts University, Sheworked one year for the president of Tufts University before marrying herhusband, Delbert Raymond Black of Newton. After the war, they settled inLexington, where they raised three children. Phyllis volunteered in herchildren's schools, as well as the Hancock Church, participating in manycharities. Later, she worked at Lexington High School as a secretary formany years. Phyllis was an excellent seamstress and knitter. She mademany of her own clothes as well as her daughter's and knit many of hergrandchildren's sweaters. After living 44 years in Lexington, whilesummering on Wings Neck, Phyllis and her husband renovated their cottageand retired to Pocasset.<br />
Phyllis loved the ocean and Cape Cod. In her early years, a summer cottage was built on Wings Neck. Swimming, boating, sailing and fishing were the summer rituals. There was always a boat named the Blackmagic and a lifetime of boat trips around Buzzards Bay to the Elizabeth Islands, Martha's Vineyard and Nantucket. With family and friends, they would often venture to the many beautiful harbors, coves and inner ponds that encompass these areas.<br />
Phyllis would often reminisce wonderful stories about her childhood summers at Old Silver Beach. There were summer pranks and all kinds of activities that went on among her beloved friends. Once she saw the promising young actor Henry Fonda, from the Playhouse, now the Sea Crest, swimming at the raft. The family would go to see the New York boat and wave to relatives as it passed through the narrow waters in the old Cape Cod Canal. There were stories about daily walks to the West Falmouth post office to pick up mail, a lengthy walk by today's standards. She felt the presence of youth of eternal summers in those Old Silver Beach stories.<br />
After retiring to the Cape, there were many off-season trips Down Maine to Florida and North Carolina to visit with her daughter and grandchildren. She also discovered that winters on the Cape with the ocean storms and animal life could be just as interesting as the summer.<br />
She is survived and dearly missed by her loving husband Delbert R. Black; her sister Claire Kehn; her three children, Charles Black, Richard Black and Diane Ducey; and her four grandchildren, Erin Stackhouse, Tim Ducey, Jennifer Ducey and Megan Ducey.<br />
A service will be held at Chapman, Cole & Gleason Funeral Home, at 584 West Falmouth Hwy. (Route 28A), West Falmouth, MA, on Saturday, December 4, 2010, at 11 a.m. For those who are interested, memorials may be offered to Hospice and Palliative Care, Charlotte Region, 1420 East 7th Street, Charlotte, NC 28204-2408.<br />

Stephen II Henry (c. 1045 - May 19, 1102), (French, Etienne Henri) Count of Blois and Count of Chartres, was the son of Theobald III, Count of Blois, and Garsinde du Maine.<br />
 <br />
In about 1080, in Chartres, France, Stephen married Adela of Normandy, a daughter of William the Conqueror. Their eldest son, Guillaume, was disinherited, supposedly for mental weakness; he was made Count of Chartres instead. Blois then passed to the second son, Theobald. Their third son Stephen of Blois became King of England after Henry I of England died without a male heir and the English did not think Henry I's daughter Empress Matilda a suitable ruler because of her sex. Stephen and Adela's youngest son was Henry of Blois, bishop of Winchester. A daughter, Lucia-Mahaut de Blois, perished in the White Ship disaster.<br />
 <br />
Count Stephen was one of the leaders of the First Crusade, often writing enthusiastic letters to Adela about the crusade's progress. He returned home in 1098 during the lengthy siege of Antioch, without having fulfilled his crusading vow, which would have been completed only if he had made it all the way to Jerusalem. He was pressured by Adela into making a second pilgrimage, and along with others who faced the same pressures after returning home prematurely, he joined the minor crusade of 1101. In 1102, Stephen was killed in battle at the age of 57, during the Crusader Kingdom of Jerusalem's siege of Ascalon in what is now Israel.<br />

Gwenwynwyn (died c.1216) was the last major ruler of south Wales beforethe completion of the Norman Conquest. He was a grandson of Owain Gwyneddand ruled southern Powys from 1195, having taken control following thedeath of the previous ruler.<br />
 <br />
His possession of a portion of Powys brought him into conflict with Llywelyn the Great, ruler of Gwynedd, who was keen to extend his own jurisdiction over the whole of Wales. King John favoured Gwenwynwyn until a marriage alliance was made between Llywelyn and John's illegitimate daughter. The two native princes then kept their distance until 1208. As a result of Gwenwynwyn's activities, John confiscated his lands and allowed Llywelyn to steal Ceredigion and Powys. Gwenwynwyn did not get his territory back for two years, but his resentment towards the English led him into an alliance with Llywelyn, which lasted from 1212 until 1216, when John restored some of Gwenwynwyn's property and the two princes fell out again. Llywelyn invaded Powys, and Gwenwynwyn is believed to have died or been killed that same year.<br />

HHe is the grandson and successor of Hugh VIII, Lord de Lusignan, by hisfather Hugh, and the nephew of Guy and Amaury II of Lusignan, both kingsof Jerusalem and Cyprus.<br />
 <br />
He was betrothed to marriage to Isabel Taillefer, daughter of the Count of Angoulême, but John Lackland of England charmed to him broke the engagement in 1200. Hugh IX asked upon King of France, but John Lackland of England refused to present himself, which let the King confiscate their possessions in France. However Hugh IX had compromised with John Lackland of England, married Mahaut of Angouleme, daughter of Wulgrin II of Angouleme and cousin of Isabelle. This marriage eventually gave him Angouleme. In 1208, Hugh IX abdicated in favor of his son and finished his days in the Holy Lands. In 1220, his son Hugh X married Isabelle, the widowed of John Lackland of England.<br />

Isabella of Angouleme<br />
From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia.<br />
 <br />
Isabella of Angouleme (c. 1187 - May 31, 1246) was countess of Angoulême and queen consort of England.<br />
 <br />
She was the only daughter and heir of Aymer Taillefer, Count of Angoulême, by Alix de Courtney; her maternal great-grandfather was King Louis VI of France. She became Countess of Angoulême in her own right in 1202, by which time she was already queen of England. Her marriage to King John took place on August 24, 1200, at Bordeaux, a year after he annulled his first marriage. At the time of this marriage Isabella was aged about thirteen, and her beauty was renowned; she is sometimes called the "Helen" of the Middle Ages by historians.<br />
 <br />
Image:iangoulm.JPG<br />
 <br />
It could not be said to have been a successful marriage, as Isabella was much younger than her husband and had a fiery character to match his. Before their marriage, she had been betrothed to Hugh IX de Lusignan, Count of La Marche. As a result of John's temerity in taking her as his second wife, King Philip II of France confiscated all his French lands, and armed conflict ensued.<br />
 <br />
When John died in 1216, Isabella was still in her twenties. She returned to France and in 1220 proceeded to marry Hugh X de Lusignan, Count de la March, the son of her former fiancé.<br />
 <br />
Isabella was accused of plotting against the French king in 1244; she fled to Fontevrault Abbey, where she died on May 31, 1246, and was buried there. Afterwards most of her many children, having few prospects in France, set sail for England and the court of their half-brother King Henry.<br />
 <br />
* With King John: 5 children, all of whom survived into adulthood, including:<br />
   1. the eldest, who became King Henry III of England on his father's death<br />
   2. Richard, Earl of Cornwall<br />
   3. Joan, the wife of King Alexander II of Scotland<br />
   4. Isabella, the wife of Emperor Frederick II<br />
   5. the youngest daughter, Eleanor, who would marry Simon de Montfort<br />
 <br />
* With Hugh X of Lusignan, the Count de la March: 9 children, all of whom survived into adulthood, including:<br />
   1. Hugh XI of Lusignan, Count de la March and Count of Angoulême (1221-1260)<br />
   2. Aymer de Valence, Bishop of Winchester (1222-1260)<br />
   3. Agnés de Lusignan (1223-1269), married William II de Chauvigny<br />

"She had a son, Frank Edwin Brundage, whose name legally was changed to Wood, I believe, but I don't know when.  He was born July 20, 1935 and died July 25 last year in Clearwater, FL.  I don't believe he had any children but I know nothing about his life.  I know he used about 15 aliases in his criminal career and that the bank managing the interest payments from a trust had a terrible time locating him.  Even in prison, he was there under different names!"<br />

Monroe Man Turns 100<br />
C.L. Miller, a long-time resident of Startup who now lives at Merrill Gardens Retirement Center in Monroe, will celebrate his 100th birthday March 28.<br />
 Miller, who remains in good health, shared some of his memories of the last century, including the last three decades in the Sky Valley.<br />
 Before arriving in Washington, Miller, one of 10 siblings and the only boy to graduate from high school, was somewhat footloose, working as a traveling salesman in the Midwest before heading to Los Angeles for work in the airplane manufacturing business.<br />
 "I had an aunt in Los Angeles," he said. "I lost my job, I was out of work, and I had interviewed with (plane builder) Lockheed with a rep. in Minneapolis. They didnʼt call and didnʼt call, so I decided to come out to Los Angeles where they were anyway."<br />
 It worked; he got the job and the career he would pursue until retirement.<br />
 He started out working on the P-38.<br />
 After six years, though, the job ended.<br />
 "Lockheed was going to lay me off, and I had a brother with a dealership in Minnesota," said Miller. "I moved back there and joined that firm." Then came World War II, and Lockheed cranked up production. Back to Los Angeles went Miller, working on the P-38, this time outfit- ting the planes with guns for the war effort. He also worked on the C-69, a large cargo plane. After a while, he became a teacher, which led to his next job.<br />
 "I was teaching about the airplanes," he said. Some people from a company called AirResearch Manufacturing came in to take a class form him. "I asked them if they had jobs in their field service department."<br />
 He switched careers after clearing it with military, as those involved in the war effort were required to do in those days, and continued to teach about airplanes for the rest of his career.<br />
 He also had a large family; he and his wife Dorothy had seven children. Upon retirement, in 1972, he moved to Startup.<br />
 "I built the first house in Startup in two years," he said. "They hadnʼt had any houses built in that long." He and Dorothy bought a manufactured home on two acres and joined the Hillcrest Baptist Church in Sultan.<br />
 After 68 years of marriage, Dorothy died in 2000. Miller moved to Merrill Gardens three years ago, at the age of 97.<br />
 He currently lives there with his second wife, Lois Carpenter Miller. He will celebrate his birthday with his five surviving children at the Northshore Senior Center in Bothell. Many of his 20 grandchildren, 41 great-grandchildren and six great- great-grandchildren are expected to attend.<br />

At Stephen's defeat at Lincoln 2 Feb 1140, he was among those who rallied to Empress Matilda when she recovered London in June, but was at Canterbury when Stephen was recrowned late in 1141. He then joined Geoffrey's plot against Stephen, but when that conspiracy collapsed, he was again adhered to Stephen, being with him at the siege of Oxford late in 1142. In 1147 he rebelled when Stephen refused to give him the castles surrendered by his nephew Gilbert, 2nd Earl of Hertford, whereupon the King marched to his nearest castle and nearly captured him. However, the Earl appears to have made his peace with Stephen before his death the following year. He married Isabel de Beaumont (1112-1172), around 1130, daughter of Sir Robert de Beaumont, Earl of Leicester, Count of Meulan, and Isabel de Vermandois. Isabel had previously been the mistress of King Henry I of England.<br />

James H. (Jim) Potter, 65, of Union Center, Wis., died Tuesday, June 16, 2009, at the St. Joseph's Memorial Hospital in Hillsboro. He was born in Elgin, Ill. on Aug. 9, 1943, to Charles and Ellen (Kahler) Potter.<br />
Most of his growing years were spent on a farm in Kahler Valley outside of Hillsboro and in the city. Jim excelled in sports at Hillsboro High School, graduating in 1961. He completed his bachelor's degree work at University of Wisconsin-La Crosse in 1965 and taught physical education in Mayville until injury altered his life in May 1966.

Jim was married in 1971 to JoAnn Godec Furrh. That union was dissolved when she had to go to a nursing home for care due to her multiple sclerosis in 1977. In 1980 Jim married Althea Mickelson Dwire and they were together until 1991.<br />
Two major accomplishments in his life were: His role in the removal of architectural barriers on the Iowa City campus of the University of Iowa and the completion and publication of his book, "Two Lives: One Autobiography." Of these, he was quite proud.<br />
Survivors include his sister, Shirley (Ray) Manguilli of Wonewoc; brother, Donald C. (Mary) Potter of Hillsboro; two former wives; step-son, Tom Furrh of Oceanside, Calif.; step-daughters, Amy Chaffin and Sharon Chaffin both of New Mexico; five step-grandchildren; one step-great-grandson; aunt, Nina Reynolds of Hillsboro; five nieces; four nephews; many other relatives and friends.<br />

William fitzOsbern (died February 22, 1071) was a relative and close counselor of William the Conqueror who became one of the great magnates of early Norman England. He was created Earl of Hereford in 1067, one of the first peerage titles in the English peerage.<br />
 <br />
He was the son of Osbern the Steward, a nephew of Duchess Gunnor, the wife of duke Richard I of Normandy. Osbern became the steward of his cousin duke Robert I of Normandy, and when Robert left the duchy to his young son William, Osbern was one of duke William's guardians. He was killed defending the person of duke William against an assassination attempt, sometime around 1040.<br />
 <br />
Osbern had married Emma, a daughter of count Rodolf of Ivry, who was a half-brother of Richard I. Through her he inherited a large property in central Normandy, including the honors of Pacy and Breteuil.<br />
 <br />
William fitzOsbern was probably raised at the court of his cousin and namesake duke William, and like his father became one of the ducal stewards. He was one of the earliest and most vigorous advocates of the invasion of England, and tradition holds that he convinced the doubters amongst the Norman barons of the feasibility of the invasion.<br />
 <br />
fitzOsbern's younger brother Osbern was one of Edward the Confessor's chaplains, and possessed the rich church of Bosham in Sussex, and was well-placed to pass along intelligence on the situation in England. He later became bishop of Exeter.<br />
 <br />
As duke William took control of England (becoming William I of England), fitzOsbern was given charge of the Isle of Wight, and then in 1067 was given the status of an earl. He is generally considered earl of Hereford, though his authority may have extended to some of the neighboring shires as well. In any case, that part of England was not yet under Norman control; the understanding must have been that fitzOsbern was to take charge of their conquest when he was able.<br />
 <br />
Also for the central part of 1067 the king returned to Normandy, leaving fitzOsbern (along with Odo of Bayeux) in charge of England. The king was back in England in 1068, and fitzOsbern accompanied him in the subdual of southwest England. He attended the king's Whitsun court in May, and then himself paid a visit to Normandy, where he fell ill for some months.<br />
 <br />
In February or March of 1069 fitzOsbern was given charge of the new castle at York, but he returned south in time to attend the king's Easter court in April. Anglo-Saxon resistance in the west Midlands was subdued later in 1069, and it is likely fitzOsbern played a major part in this, though the details are not certain. During this time fitzOsbern and his followers pushed on into Wales, beginning the conquest of Gwent.<br />
 <br />
As part of the assertion of Norman control over England (and Wales), fitzOsbern was one of the major Norman castle builders. Early castles attributed to him include Carisbrooke, Chepstow, Wigmore, Monmouth, and Striguil, as well as creating or improving the fortifications of the towns of Hereford and Shrewsbury.<br />
 <br />
In 1070 trouble arose in Flanders, where king William's brother-in-law Baldwin VI of Flanders had died, leaving his county and his young sons in the hands of his widow Richilda. Her control of Flanders was challenged by the brother of her late husband, Robert the Frisian. Looking for help, she offered herself in marriage to fitzOsbern. He could not resist the chance to become de facto count of the richest principality in France, and hurried there with a small and hastily gathered force. They were defeated, and fitzOsbern was killed, at the Battle of Cassel in February 1071.<br />
 <br />
fitzOsbern married Adeliza, daughter of Roger I of Tosny (it is also possible that he married Richilda, the dowager countess of Flanders, shortly before his death). He was succeeded in Normandy by his eldest son, William of Breteuil, and in England and Wales by his younger son, Roger of Breteuil. His daughter Emma married Ralph de Gael, earl of Norfolk.<br />

Contains a complete record of all records wherein Robert Bartlett is mentioned. He was one of the group that accompanied Thomas Hooker to America, but there is no record of him in Cambridge. He first appears on record in Hartford in 1639, about the time he married. It is suggested that in 1632 Robert Bartlett was a young, single man, perhaps a servant to one of the other passengers. An inventory of the estate of Robert Bartlett was presented at court on 29 Mar 1676 by his widow, Ann Bartlett. It totalled 658 pounds, 18 schillings, and 6 pence which was sizable for the time. This record also contains records of his wife's will and Samuel Bartlett's request to the court that he be put in charge of his brother, Nathaniel Bartlett's, share since he was not competant to administer them himself.<br />

 <br />
The Lyon left Bristol, England on June 22, 1632 and at that time Robert took the oath of allegiance to the King and government of England before he embarked. After being at sea for twelve weeks, they arrived at Boston Harbor on Sunday evening, September 16, 1632. The passengers on that ship brought with them the Charter which was long afterwards protected from seizure by being hidden in the famous Charter Oak and which gave them a grant of land on which they founded the City of Hartford, Conn. in 1637. When this settlement was made, the name of Robert Bartlett appears as one of the original proprietors and he is known to have been a resident of the place until he moved to Northampton in 1655.<br />
 <br />
There is a Monument in the center of Town commerating this.. Robert was an original proprietor of Hartford, CT. He received 8 Acres in the division 1632 - 1640. He lived on the West side of the highway which is now Layette Street.. (Families of Early Hartford, CT by Lucius Barnes Barbara)& (Families 1620 - 1700 Complied by Frank R. Holmes-Baltimore Genealogical Publishing Co.)<br />
 <br />
Robert was declared a Freeman on 4/10/1645 - Freemen had the right of suffrage, enjoyed advantages in the division of land &, before the representative system started, freeman were members of thn General Court. The principal qualifications for this privilege seem to have been church membership.<br />
 <br />
Fenwick, Mrs. Mary, was slandered by Bartlett, in 1646; for which he was<br />
ordered to stand in the Pillory during Lecture, whipt, fined £5 with six months imprisonment. This was not the day to speak evil of dignitaries.<br />
 <br />
Freeman's Oath: Becoming a freeman in Puritan New England originally meant<br />
becoming a member in good standing of the local church -- in turn meaning that a man had to demonstrate persuasively that he was one of the "elect" (a Calvinist concept essentially meaning that he was predestined to go to Heaven).<br />
 <br />
Then he was inducted as a freeman, meaning he could vote in town meetings and elections. The oath essentially was a swearing of allegiance to the colony.<br />
 <br />
Remember, Mass Bay Colony (and to a lesser extent Conn Colony) were theocracies, except that clegymen generally did not hold civil offices. "The Freeman's Oath" was the first paper printed in New England. It was printed at Cambridge by Stephen Daye in 1639, upon a single sheet, in the form of a handbill and without date."<br />
 <br />
"The Oath was in these words as established in 1634" in Massachusetts:<br />
 <br />
" I, _____, being by God's providence, an Inhabitant and Freeman within the Jurisdiction of this Commonwealth: do freely acknowledge myself to be subject to the Government thereof: And therefore do here swear by the great and<br />
dreadful Name of the Ever-living God, that I will be true and faithful to the same, and will accordingly yield assistance and support thereunto, with my person and<br />
estate, as in equity I am bound! and will also truly endeavor to maintain and preserve all the liberties and privileges thereof, submitting myself to the wholesome Laws and Orders made and established by the same. And further that I will not plot or practice any evil against it, or consent to any that shall so do; but will timely discover and reveal the same to the lawful Authority now here established for the speedy preventing thereof.<br />
 <br />
"Moreover, I do solemnly bind myself in the sight of God that when I shall be called to give my voyce touching any matter of this State in which Freemen are to deal, I will give my vote and suffrage as I shall judge in mine own conscience may best conduce to tend to the public weal of the body. So help me God in the Lord Jesus Christ."<br />
 <br />
Dr. Prescott goes on: It is to be recollected that none but Freemen could vote<br />
at any election, or hold any office, not even that of a juryman. And none could be admitted a freeman unless he was a member of the church. Whenever any person, not a member, was tried for any crime or offence therefore, it was by both judge and jury belonging to the church and entertaining strong predjudices against him.<br />
 <br />
"This," remarked Gov. Hutchinson, "was a most extraordinary order of law," and yet it was continued in force until the dissolution of the colonial governments.<br />
 <br />
Rev. Jonathan Edwards of Northampton, Mass., was one of the first to discard the practice, which act was the cause of so much opposition that it eventually resulted in his dismission in 1750.<br />
 <br />
The main attack by the Indians upon Northampton, came on (King Phillip's War) March 14, 1676 when the Indians assaulted three sides of the stockade at the same time in the early part of the day. Had it not been for the fact that the settlers had most valuable assistance from a company of troops then garrisoned within the town, it would have been completely destroyed and the settlers all massacred or some of them carried away into capacity among the Indians and their French allies in Canada. As it was the Indians broke the stockade near the home of Robert & Ann Bartlett and killed 5 men, but were finally driven out and retreated without further damage. Robert was Slain by the Indians, & was buried in the Public Highway very near the spot where he fell for the reason it was said that it was not thought safe to carry his body to the cemetery. He had an estate valued at 654 pounds or upward of $ 2000, which was a large estate for a farmer in those days.<br />
 <br />
Since Robert was buried in the Public Highway where he died, then when the Highway "Bartlett Lane" was redone his body was moved to the back yard of his home.. Then when the street was widen the houses were moved a few feet back and it is presently believe that his old home is residing above where he is laid..<br />
 <br />
As early as 1658, the town of Northampton, built a ferryboat for the use of its citizens and placed it in charge of Robert Bartlett. It was reached by a road across the meadows from the lower end or what is now Pleasant St., and presumably was located not far from the ferry at Hockanum. Since Hadley had not been settled, it probably was designed for transporting hay and other farm produce and not for passenger service.<br />

In the Hartford land inventory of February 1639 Robert held four parcels of land; three acres with dwelling house, yards and gardens, two roods of upland, three acres of upland and two acres of swamp on the east side of Great River. On May 18, 1655, Robert bought of William Bloomfield five acres of land.<br />
 <br />
The Ship "Lyon"<br />
 <br />
LYON. This ship was famous in the history of the early emigration to Massachusetts, and her Master was equally noted for his skillful seamanship and his sympathy with the policy of the Puritan leaders. In 1630, 1631, and 1632 she made four voyages hither in quick succession under his command with the regularity and safety of a ferry, and on one of them saved the new settlement from starvation and death by her timely arrival with provisions and anti - scorbutics. The official connection of the Lyon with the Winthrop Fleet is of the same character as related of the Mary and John, as both were doubtless approved by the Governor and Assistants. In his letter of March 28, 1630, to his wife, written from the Arbella, off the Isle of Wight, after noting the sailing of the Mary and John, Winthrop wrote: 'and the ship which goes from Bristowe (Bristol) carrieth about eighty persons', This was the Lyon and she probably sailed from that port to accommodate passengers living In the West Counties -- Lancashire, Cheshire, Warwick, Gloucestershire, and Somerset. That they were authorized to settle in the limits of the Bay Patent seems assured as there is no evidence to the contrary following their arrival. The date of her departure is not known (probably in March) but her arrival at Salem is reported `in the latter part of May' some time before the Arbella reached that port. The identity of this ship is not established as there were several of her name in existence at that period. In view of her valuable services to the Colony it is to be hoped that the necessary search may be made to fix her home port, previous history, tonnage, and ownership. Of Captain William Peirce, her Master, more particulars are known. He had sailed to Plymouth in 1623 as Master of the Anne of London, bringing the last lot of passengers to the Pilgrim settlement. He was then a resident of Ratcliffe, parish of Stepney, London, and at that date was about thirty-one years old. He made a voyage to Salem in 1629 as Master of the Mayflower (not the Pilgrim ship) and thereafter he was in constant traffic in passengers and merchandise across the Atlantic. He took up his residence in Boston in 1632 and was admitted freeman May I4, 1634. His wife, Bridget, joined the church February 2, 1632/3; perhaps a second wife, as a William Peirce, mariner of White chapel, was licensed in 1615 to marry Margaret Gibbs. White chapel and Stepney are adjoining parishes. He became a Town and Colony official and was engaged In coast wise shipping thereafter. He compiled an Almanac for New England which was the second issue in 1639 from the Daye press at Cambridge. In 1641 he was killed by the Spaniards while on a voyage to the island of New Providence, Bahamas Group, whither he was taking passengers for settlement.<br />
 <br />
This was the last voyage of the Lyon. On the following November, while returning to England, it was wrecked on a shoal a few miles from the mouth of the Chesapeake River.<br />

Note:<br />
Dissent continued to plague Massachusetts and Connecticut authorities. In 1656 a party of dissatisfied Puritans left Connecticut to establish Northampton still further north of Springfield. The upper Connecticut Valley saw the settlement of Hadley (1661), Hatfield (1670), Deerfield (1670), Northfield (1673), and Greenfield (1686).<br />

Since his retirement from Eckerd in 1978, he had written several other books of poems, including No Chance Encounter.<br />
He was appointed a professor of history at Florida Presbyterian College in 1962, four years after the liberal arts school was founded. Its name was changed in 1972 to Eckerd College.<br />
The son of a pediatrician, Mr. Brundage was born in Buffalo, N.Y. A frail boy, he became familiar with this area when his mother brought him to Pass-a-Grille and St. Petersburg in the 1920s to escape Buffalo's winters.<br />
""The streets were brick then, with no curbing, and there were turkey buzzards every place,'' he said in the 1986 interview. ""There was an old wooden bridge to Pass-a-Grille, and the beach there stretched out about a mile. I used to climb on the girders of the Don (CeSar Beach Resort) when it was being built. When I was 8 years old, I went through every book in the Mirror Lake Library.''<br />
Traveling later with his family to Europe, he spent much of his time at the British Museum, visiting the Egyptology room virtually every afternoon and laying the groundwork for the direction of his education.<br />
An honors graduate in history from Amherst College, he was working on his doctorate in Egyptology at the University of Chicago's Oriental Institute when World War II began unfolding. As he got his degree in 1939, top-ranked German archaeologists fled to this country to escape Hitler and took most of the jobs in the discipline.<br />
Dr. Brundage had concentrated on Spanish in college and shifted to Latin American history, specializing in pre-Columbian American Indian History.<br />
In addition to Spanish, he spoke French and could read Italian, German, Latin, Egyptian hieroglyphic (old, middle and new kingdoms), Demotic, Hebrew, Coptic, and Quechua, the language of the Incas, and Nahuatl, the language of the Aztecs.<br />
His books included The Empire of the Inca (1963), Lords of Cuzco (1967) and A Rain of Darts (1972). He also wrote Gian Carlo, published in 1975 by Valkyrie Press, about his Siamese cat, and The Juniper Palace (1951), a book of poems.<br />
He began his teaching career at MacMurray College in Jacksonville, Ill. He also taught at Carleton College in Northfield, Minn. Before joining Florida Presbyterian, he was History Department chairman at Cedar Crest College at Allentown, Pa.<br />
During World War II, he worked in the Office of Coordinator of Inter-American Affairs and as political desk officer for Chile at the U.S. State Department.<br />
A mountain was named after him at the base of Palmer Peninsula in Antarctica. He once said it was done in recognition of work he did for the cause of polar exploration while working for the government.<br />
Survivors include his wife, Virginia; a daughter, Christina Brundage, St. Petersburg; and a granddaughter, Anya Clancy-Brown, Clearwater.<br />

From Wikipedia<br />
 <br />
Known as "de Bienfaite", "de Clare", and "de Tonbridge". Accompanied his kinsman William the Conqueror into England, and was rewarded with no less than one hundred and seventy six lordships and large grants of land in England, including the right to build the castles of Clare and of Tonbridge, in return for his service at the Battle of Hastings, and general assistance in conquering the Saxon. Served as Joint Chief Justiciar in William's absence, and played a major part in suppressing the revolt of 1075.<br />
Richard took the name Earl of Clare from one of his lordships in Suffolk, where Clare Castle still exists. The modern Irish county of County Clare was historically part of the North Munster Gaelic kingdom of Thomond, dominated by the O'Briens, Kings of Thomond. The region was granted to the De Clare family in 1275 and they became Lords of Thomond. When the boundaries of the modern County Clare were fixed by Sir Henry Sidney in 1565, it was named after the De Clares.<br />
His parents were Gilbert "Crispin", Count of Brionne and his mistress Constance de Eu. Gilbert was married to Gunnora d'Aunou, and some sources list her as Richards mother. Richard's father is also sometimes listed as Robert I "the Devil", father of William the Conqueror. Sources as far back as the Annals of the Four Masters claim that Richard's great grandson, Richard "Strongbow", was the direct descendant of Robert "the Devil". Gilbert "Crispin" is a descendant of Robert's cousin, but not Robert himself. One thing can be sure, Richard was a close and trusted friend of the King.<br />

First wife: Sopia S. Rouse - wed 2 NOV 1874 in Gaines, Kent, MI<br />
Father:     Edward Cartwright<br />
Mother:    Almira Hotchkiss<br />
 <br />
Burr E. Cartwright is a native of Buffalo, N. Y., born October 26, 1850. a son of Edward and Elmira (Hotchkiss) Cartwright, residents of near Buffalo, former a native of Wales, and latter of Connecticut. The subject of our sketch attended the common schools until fifteen years of age, at which time he entered the Hethcote school, where he remained until his nineteenth year. The first commercial experience of Mr. Cartwright was in the lumber business in Buffalo, when, in 1879, he removed to Ridgway, Elk Co., Penn., as purchasing agent, in the lumber trade, for the firm of Scatchard & Son, in whose employ he remained until 1881. In that year he and W. W. Mattison formed a partnership in the lumber business, which organization resolved itself, in 1883, into the Ridgway Lumber Company, the several members thereof being Burr E. Cartwright, D. C. Oyster, Alfred Short and W. W. Mattison. In the fall of 1885 Mr. Mattison retired from the firm, W. H. Horton taking his place. In the following year Mr. Cartwright and Mr. Horton withdrew from the Ridgway Lumber Company, and entered into a co-partnership in contracting with the Northwestern Mining & Exchange Company, to cut the lumber and peel the bark on 8,000 acres. In 1888 Mr. Cartwright purchased Mr. Horton's interest in this enterprise, keeping, however, intact the former contract, made under the firm name of Horton & Cartwright. In order to fulfill this contract. Mr. Cartwright has in operation three saw-mills, having a capacity of 200,000 feet per day. He also operates a shingle and planing-mill at Horton City, a place located near the Mead Run school-house, and in the carrying on of the enormous business, 500 men are constantly employed. He has, in all, seventeen miles of standard-gauge railroad in operation, equipped with five locomotives and fifty logging cars. In the spring of 1889, Mr. Cartwright completed a contract with the Northwestern Mining & Exchange Company, for the building of one hundred dwellings at Mead Run. He owns and carries on two general stores, doing an aggregate business of $15,000 per month - one store being located at Horton City for the convenience of his own men, the other, an outside enterprise, being at Mead Run. The Horton City saw-mills are, perhaps, the best equipped mills in the eastern part of Pennsylvania, being provided with circular and gang saws; lath mills are attached, with the latest improved labor-saving appliances, the whole being lighted by electricity. The daily shipments of bark and lumber from the several stations along Mr. Cartwright's line, amount to twenty-five cars. Thus, in his management of his gigantic lumber and bark interests and contracts, together with the necessary saw-mills, adjuncts and appointments; in the conducting of his mammoth stores, and the directing of his army of employees, it may be said of Mr. Burr E. Cartwright, that he stands in the front rank among the lumbermen of Pennsylvania, and, perhaps, of the entire Union.<br />
 <br />
In addition to the above-mentioned enterprises, Mr. Cartwright has, since the writing of this sketch, organized the Brock Coal Company (capital $50,000), of which he is president. It is their intention to fully equip these mines (which are located at Brockwayville, Jefferson Co., Penn.) with electrical mining machinery, and they expect to have a daily output of 1,000 tons. They will commence shipping coal about May 1, 1890.<br />
 <br />
In 1874 Mr. Cartwright was married to Miss Sophia Rouse, of Gaines, Mich., who survived her wedding but ten months, and one son was born to them, Morgan Rouse, now attending Deveaux College, Suspension Bridge, N. Y. In 1877 Mr. Cartwright took for his second wife Miss Alice Jane Higham, who has borne him one daughter: Orrel Higham. Mrs. Cartwright attends the Congregational Church. Mr. Cartwright, who is one of the most active workers in the Republican party, served three years as chairman of the Republican county committee; in the fall of 1888 be was named as the choice of Elk county for congress, and at the congressional conference held at DuBois he was tendered the nomination, but owing to his vast business engagements, the constituency had, reluctantly, to accept his refusal. He is a member of the F. & A. M., Elk Lodge, No. 379; of Elk Chapter, No. 230, R. A. M.; of Knapp Commandery, No. 40, K. T., and of Bloomsburg Consistory.<br />

 <br />
When Robert I, Duke of Normandy died in 1035 his illegitimate son William inherited his father's title. Several leading Normans, including Gilbert of Brionne, Osbern the Seneschal and Alan of Brittany, became William's guardians.<br />
 <br />
A number of Norman barons including Raoul de Gacé would not accept an illegitimate son as their leader. In 1040 an attempt was made to kill William but the plot failed. Gilbert however was murdered while he was peaceably riding near Eschafour. It is believed two of his killers were Ralph of Wacy and Robert de Vitot. This appears to have been an act of vengeance for wrongs inflicted upon the orphan children of Giroie by Gilbert, and it is not clear what Raoul de Gacé had to do in the business. Fearing they might meet their father's fate, his sons Richard and his brother Baldwin were conveyed by their friends to the court of Baldwin, Count of Flanders.<br />

Robert de Beaumont, 3rd Earl of Leicester (died 1190) was an Englishnobleman, one of the principal followers of Henry the Young King in theRevolt of 1173-1174 against his father Henry II. He is also called RobertBlanchemains (meaning "White Hands" in French).<br />
 <br />
He was the son of Robert de Beaumont, 2nd Earl of Leicester, a staunch supporter of Henry II, and he inherited from his father large estates in England and Normandy.<br />
 <br />
When the revolt of the younger Henry broke out in April 1173, Robert went to his castle at Breteuil in Normandy. The rebels' aim was to take control of the duchy, but Henry II himself led an army to besiege the castle; Robert fled, and the Breteuil was taken on September 25 or 26.<br />
 <br />
Robert apparently went to Flanders, where he raised a large force of mercenaries, and landed at Walton, Suffolk, on September 29, 1173. He joined forces with Hugh Bigod, 1st Earl of Norfolk, and the two marched west, aiming to cut England in two across the Midlands and to relieve the king's siege of Robert's castle at Leicester. However, they were intercepted by the king's supporters and defeated in battle at Fornham, near Bury St Edmunds, on October 17. Robert, along with his wife and many others, was taken prisoner. Henry II took away the earl's lands and titles as well.<br />
 <br />
He remained in captivity until January 1177, well after most of the other prisoners had been released. The king was in a strong position and could afford to be merciful; not long after his release Robert's lands and titles were restored, but not his castles. All but two of his castles had been destroyed, and those two (Montsorrel in Leicestershire and Pacy in Normandy) remained in the king's hands.<br />
 <br />
Robert had little influence in the remaining years of Henry II's reign, but was restored to favor by Richard I. He carried one of the swords of state at Richard's coronation in 1189. In 1190 Robert went on pilgrimage to Palestine, but he died in Greece on his return journey.<br />
 <br />
Robert married Pernelle, who was either a granddaughter or great-granddaughter of Hugh de Grandmesnil. They had 5 children:<br />
    * Robert, who succeeded his father as Earl of Leicester;<br />
    * Roger, who became Bishop of St Andrews in 1189;<br />
    * William, who was a leper;<br />
    * Amicia, who married Simon de Montfort, and whose son Simon subsequently became Earl of Leicester;<br />
    * Margaret, who married Saer de Quincy, later 1st Earl of Winchester.<br />

Note: In terms of the death date (25 Oct 1053) at the siege of Arques, Ithink Curt is referring to Enguerrand II, d. 1053 at the siege of Arque,whom I have as the grandson. Maybe the grandson is the Enguerrand who m.Adele in 1333/4, as his 1st wife, before marrying Adelaid, sister ofWilliam I.<br />
 <br />
Note: Curt's source must have Adele marrying Enguerrand as her 2nd husband, and not as her 1st, as I show it. This may be true, but their supposed son Hugh must have been born well before 1033/4 (probably around 1000) because Hugh (Adele & Enguerrand's son) d. 20 Nov 1052. He would have been born in 1333/4 and be 18 or 19 years old, possible however unlikely. However AR & CP have Hugh's son Enguerrand II, dead at a siege in 1053; this is impossible if his father wasn't born until 1033/4, because he could be at most 6 or 7 years old, assuming his father sired him when only 12 or 13 years old. Enguerrand II married Adelaide, the sister of William the Conqueror and had at least one child before his death, which clearly could not have been at the age of 6 or 7.<br />
 <br />
This leaves at least 4 possibilities: (1) Hugh, b. c 997, is not a son of Enguerrand I, maybe his brother; (2) Hugh is the son of Enguerrand by an unknown 1st wife (prior to Adlele); (3) Adele did not marry Enguerrand I, but his grandson Enguerrand II as mentioned above; (4) Curt's or my sources are incorrect (I think least likely of the 4 possibilities). I will use possibility (2) until I can get more information about which of the 4 possibilities are true.<br />

John Webster was born on August 16, 1590 in Cossington, Leicestershire, England to Matthew and Elizabeth (Ashton) Webster. His was a family of some substance. On November 7, 1609, he and Agnes Smith were married at Cossington. They had five children by the time they immigrated to New England, and had two more after they arrived.<br />
 <br />
John Webster and his family settled in Watertown, Massachusetts in the early 1630s and moved to Hartford in 1636, probably with Thomas Hooker's group, which left Newtown, Massachusetts in April 1636. He was one of the original landholders of Hartford, was a member of the committee that sat with the Court of Magistrates of the Colony of Connecticut in 1637 and 1638, and became an Assistant to the General Court of the Colony of Connecticut in 1639. As an Assistant, he was one of a small group of men who were second in power only to the Governor, Deputy Governor, and General Court of Magistrates. He traveled to towns in Connecticut as a judge, helped create criminal laws for the colony, settled land and boundary disputes, helped the New England Congress supply Connecticut towns with soldiers and ammunition for an expedition against the Indians, and surveyed the highway from Hartford to Windsor. He was a Commissioner to the United Colonies of New England in 1654.<br />
 <br />
The Colony of Connecticut elected him as Deputy Governor in 1655, with Thomas Welles as Governor. The next year, 1656, John Webster was elected as Governor. Elections were annual, and prior to 1659 it was believed that no person should serve a term of more than one year. In 1657 John Winthrop was elected as governor, with Thomas Welles as Deputy Governor and John Webster as Chief Magistrate.<br />
 <br />
John Webster was one of the leading members of the First congregational Church of Hartford, whose minister, the Rev. Thomas Hooker, was the dynamic leader of the first settlers that came to Hartford. When Hooker died in 1647, a controversy arose as to who should become his successor. The Rev. Samuel Stone, Hooker's assistant, was supported by a majority of the church members. However, Rev. Stone wanted to change some aspects of church procedures, including liberalizing the eligibility requirements for infant baptism and admission to communion, while limiting the autonomy of each congregation. A significant number of the parishioners disagreed with Stone and wanted Michael Wigglesworth as Rev. Hooker's successor. A religious dispute arose, and the congregation became split. Church and state were not separate at that time, so this became a political as well as a spiritual crisis for Hartford.<br />
 <br />
The dissenting group, of which John Webster was a prominent member, wanted to withdraw from the Hartford church and move to Massachusetts, but Rev. Stone and his followers would not release them from their church covenant. The dissenters attempted to get other Congregational Churches in nearby towns to accept them, but none would. The principles disputed in Hartford were introduced in the General Assembly as the Half-Way Covenant in August 1657 and became points of conflict for Congregational Churches throughout New England for over a decade. A key provision allowed Congregational churches to baptize children of parents who had themselves been baptized but who had never professed conversion and had consequently never been fully admitted to the Church. The Half-Way Covenant was approved by a New England church synod in 1662 and finally passed by the Connecticut legislature in May 1669. On February 12, 1669/70 some members of the First Church of Hartford left to form the Second Church.<br />
 <br />
Meanwhile, on April 18, 1659, through the arbitration of some Massachusetts Congregational Church leaders, many of the initial dissenters and Rev. Stone's faction signed an agreement for the former group to move to Massachusetts. The Hadley Company, as it was known, left Hartford shortly after that, with John Webster as one of its leaders. He was given the responsibility of laying out the roads for the company. He and his family went first to Northampton, Massachusetts, and later to Hadley, where he was made a magistrate in May 1660. He died there, of a fever, on April 5, 1661 and is buried in Hadley. His wife Agnes died in Hartford in 1667. His most famous descendant was Noah Webster, who was born in Hartford in 1758 and who died May 28, 1843, in New Haven.<br />
 <br />
John Webster's home lot in Hartford, Connecticut was on the east side of what became Governor Street (the present Popieluszko Court).<br />

From Wikipedia<br />
 <br />
Gunther (in Latin Gundaharius and in Anglicized Old Norse Gunnar) was a king of the Burgundians west of the Rhine from at least 411 to his death in 437. Legendary tales about Gundaharius appear in Latin, medieval German, Old Norse, and Old English texts, especially concerning his relations with Siegfried (in Old Norse Sigurd) and the death of Gunther from treachery in the hall of Attila the Hun.<br />
 <br />
History<br />
According to Olympiodorus, in 411 Jovinus was proclaimed tyrannos of Moundiakon in Germania Secunda through the support of the Alan Goar and of Guntiarios who was called commander of the Burgundians.<br />
 <br />
After the defeat of Jovinus in 413, the Burgundians were permitted by Rome to settle in Gaul, on the Rhine and it may have been then that Gundaharius first established the Burgundian Kingdom west of the Rhine with Worms as its capital.<br />
 <br />
In 435 the Burgundians attempted to thrust farther westward but were defeated by the Roman general Aetius. In 437 the Huns (perhaps with the support of Aetius) attacked and destroyed the Burgundian kingdom. Gundaharius met his death and the surviors were allowed by the Romans to settle in Savoy. Attila himself seems to have had no part in this since, at least according to Priscus, in 435 Attila was negotiating peace with Romans at Margus in upper Moesia and until 439 was occupied with subduing the nations of Scythia and warring on the Sorosgi.<br />
 <br />
Gundaharius' successor was Gundioc, whose relation to Gundaharius is unknown.<br />
 <br />
In the Lex Burgundionum', issued by the Burgundian king Gundobad (c. 480-516), it is decreed that those who were free under the kings Gibica, Gundomar, Gislaharius, and Gundaharius will remain free. In later Germanic legend Gunther appears directly as the son of Gibica or Gibeche/Gjúki. In German accounts his brothers are named Gernot and Giselher (all three called kings in the Nibelungenlied). Norse tradition knows of a younger brother named Gotthorm (Gotormr) which might dervie from Gundomar. This suggests that historically the king Gibica of the Bungrundian Laws might have been the father of three kings Gundomar, Gislaharius, and Gundaharius who shared the kingdom, presumably with Gundaharius being the high king. But if so, the order of the names here is puzzling. One would expect Gundaharius to be named immediately after Gibica.<br />

Edward the Exile (1016- February 1057), son of King Edmund Ironside and of Ealdgyth, gained the name of "Exile" from his life spent mostly far from the England of his forefathers. When only a few months old, he was sent by the usurper Canute to be murdered in Denmark, rather than on English soil. Instead, he was secretely brought to Kiev and then made his way to Hungary. On hearing the news of his being alive, Edward the Confessor recalled him to England and made him his heir. However, Edward the Exile died shortly after his return, causing a succession dispute that ultimately led to the Norman Conquest of England.<br />
 <br />
The paternity of his wife Agatha is debated: the medieval sources agree that she was a sister of Hungarian Queen, and disagree as to other details. The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle and Florence of Worcester's "Chronicon ex chronicis" describe Agatha as a blood relative of the Henry III, Holy Roman Emperor. Her rare Greek name was recently interpreted in favour of a different version, expounded by Geoffrey Gaimar and Roger of Howden, that her father was a "Russian king", i.e., Yaroslav the Wise. Their children included Edgar Ætheling and Saint Margaret of Scotland.<br />

History of the Randall House<br />
Chapter Six<br />
Charles Patriquin, 1927 - 1932<br />
1927 June 27:   W.C.B. Harris conveyed the land to Charles Patriquin, farmer. [Book 146 page 647]<br />
1927 July 28:   The Acadian noted the death of Eardley Randall at the home of Mr. and Mrs. Thomas Sutherland in Lower Wolfville. He and his sister Annie had been living there. He was 70 years old. According to the obituary, "In recent years his health had been failing and some time ago he suffered a shock from which he never recovered."<br />
1931 February 19:   The Acadian noted the death of Miss Annie B. Randall, at the Sutherlands' home. "For a long period Miss Randall, a gentle and beautiful Christian spirit, was confined to the house and much of the time to her bed, seen by but few."<br />
      Charles Patriquin, a descendant of Jean Patriquin, was among the Foreign Protestants who emigrated from Rotterdam and nearby ports to Halifax during May and June, 1752. Many of them were from the city and vicinity of Montbeliard, a semi-autonomous enclave in eastern France, under the jurisdiction of the House of Warttenberg. The Patriquins were part of the migration of Foreign Protestants to the province following the establishment of Halifax. To counter-balance the Acadian Catholics, the British intended to populate the colony with Protestants who owed allegiance to the British Crown.<br />
      James Graham Patriquin was born in Tatamagouche in 1837 and in 1863 married Matilda Pick in Wolfville. They lived on Gaspereau Avenue and had five children - Charles Aubrey, George Harvey, Ella May, Flora Belle, and Grace. James was a harness maker and died in 1882. In 1899 Charles, age 35, fruitgrower, married Sarah N. Craig, 28, daughter of Thomas and Susan Craig.<br />
      In a letter in 1992, Graham wrote:<br />
My parents lived first in a house my father built at the corner of Willow Street and Gaspereau Avenue. For about ten years they lived on Long Island North Grand Pre while Dad operated Evangeline Beach as a resort. They lived in Lower Wolfville from 1910 to 1927 and then in the Randall House from 1927-1947. I spent each summer in Wolfville. Dad died in April, 1947.<br />
We four children grew up on the farm in Lower Wolfville. While my youngest sister, Flora, lived with our parents in the Randall House until her marriage in 1932, the rest of us knew it only as visitors.<br />
My mother had yearned to live in that house for years, while Eardley and Sister Annie were occupants. When it became available, she had her way, with the quiet determination that was one of her characteristics. We children were happy about it; Dad was quickly enthusiastic once he got inside.<br />
      When the Patriquins lived in the house, Charles and Sarah used the room to the rear of the parlour as the dining room. The north east room was used for dining if there were more than four present. In the kitchen, Sarah used a wood-burning stove for cooking and heating. The family was puzzled by the origins of the mortar and whitewash in the north west section of the cellar. The kitchen chamber was for overnight visitors or small children who loved its convenience. The finished and unfinished rooms in the attic were unused. Although the house had running water, the electricity and the bathroom were installed by the Patriquins.<br />
      In her letter of 17 November 1992, Vernita Murphy remembered Charles Patriquin:<br />
I only knew him as a afrmer in Lower Wolfville. After he retired he purchased the Randall House. He kept ducks on the pond. At one time he had two lovely swans which drew a lot of admiration ... I was saddened some years ago on visiting Wolfville to see what a change was made to the beloved pond where the children of Wolfville and adults too spent happy hours. It was truly a favourite spot for all.<br />
      Glen Hancock grew up in Wolfville. He recalls his visits to the house when it was owned by the Patriquins.<br />
When I was a boy, the old house on the corner of Main Street and Victoria Avenue was known as the Patriquin House. All houses in Wolfville were named after the residents. The only manner in which we used the word "Randall" was in respect to the woods up on the hill.<br />
The Patriquins were an old Wolfville family for which the community had great affection. There were one or two pretty girls in the family as I remember, and a boy - Graham - whom I befriended and still maintain contact with him.<br />
C.A. Patriquin was a stocky man with strong hands. He can be remembered pushing a wheelbarrow laden with fresh vegetables to the Wolfville grocery store. He managed a fertile slope of early land leading from the house down almost to the edge of the duck pond. The garden plot has now been sodded over and the duck pond transformed into an artifical pool. This was in Mr. Patriquin's later years, of course, as he had in his early career been a harness maker. But we knew him more for his involvement in the Boy Scout movement. He was an ardent "ornithologer", a man with a great sensitivity for the welfare of wild creatures. Whenever an injured bird was found in the bush it was promptly taken to Mr. Patriquin where a splint was quickly fashioned for a broken wing or leg. There was always a clutter of cages and pens behind the house, containing an assortment of birds, squirrels, and other small animals, recuperating from various injuries.<br />
Not to deny the influence of renowned Robie Tufts on local youth with a bent for the natural sciences, Mr. Patriquin urged more boys into ornithology and biology than anyone else - boys like Earl Godfrey, Sherman Bleakney, Merritt Gibson, Ron Smith and Austin Rand, whose names are known widely.<br />
I had a warm and pleasant relationship with the Patriquins, and many a Sunday supper I enjoyed in their dining room - creamed asparagus in season, prepared by Mrs. Patriquin, a tall rather quiet woman. It always intrigued me when Mr. Patriquin would start up the stairs after supper, saying to Mrs. Patriquin, "Call me in five minutes". And in exactly five minutes she would call him from a refreshing five-minute nap.<br />
The interior of the house does not seem to have been very much changed from those days of the mid-thirties.<br />
Mr. Patriquin was an enthusiastic proponent of the temperance movement, but he had a broadminded attitude toward human frailities. People of my vintage will remember seeing Charlie Patriquin and B.O. Davidson (the publisher of The Acadian and an enemy of the demon rum) taking their constitutionals together, arm in arm, as Mr. Davidson was blind. They were the butt of many local jokes, but in retrospect it was a charming relationship and is now remembered with respect.<br />
Many old Wolfville boys still refer to the museum as the "old Patriquin place", but it has now been given the name of the Randalls who occupied it longer than any other family.<br />
      By the time the Patriquins owned the house there were few women available to work as hired girls. Between 1861 and 1901, approximately 250,000 people emigrated from the Maritime Provinces which had a population of 893,953 in 1901. Many of these were young people who went to New England looking for adventure, an opportunity to earn good wages, and a measure of independence.<br />
      As the labour force was reduced, women who had large families or large households were interested in modern conveniences which could be used for unimaginative and repetitious tasks. These new inventions saved time and labour.<br />
      By introducing electricity into the house, the Patriquins opened the door on the new world of technology. Now, if they chose, they could have an electric sewing machine, an electric vacuum cleaner, or an electric iron.<br />
      Consider that remarkable innovation - the electric iron. Until now, every woman used a flatiron which weighed between three and twelve pounds [about one to five kilograms] and which was heated on top of the wood-burning kitchen stove. Ironing was done close to the hot stove even in the summer. Now, however, an inexpensive electric iron could be purchased which weighed less than three pounds [less than one kilogram], did not require the lighting of a wood stove and gave the woman the summertime option to iron in a cool room.<br />
1932 January 28:   Charles A. Patriquin, farmer, of Wolfville, and Sarah Patriquin conveyed the land to J. Graham Patriquin, teacher, of Wolfville. [Book 157 page 6]<br />

Dr. John Henry Runstrom, 80, passed away on Tuesday, March 1, 2011, inhis home. Family and friends called him Dad or Grandpa, Jack or Doc.<br />
Jack was born on June 6, 1930, to Fannie and Albin Runstrom in Gary, Ind. He grew up in Sheboygan. He served on a destroyer in the U.S. Naval Reserve. He attended Lakeland College and Northern Illinois College of Optometry. On July 11, 1953, he married his high school sweetheart Patricia Jane Diers.

Dr. Runstrom served Ladysmith as an optometrist from 1962 to 1992. He was an active member of the Ladysmith Congregational-UCC Church, Jaycees and Kiwanis.<br />
Jack lived life to the fullest. His experiences often became wonderful stories. As many remember, Jack would be the center of attention as he told these stories at family reunions, in the hunting or fishing camp, as well as at daily meetings with his coffee shop buddies.<br />
He is remembered for calling "a spade a spade" when involved in some rather heated political discussions.<br />
Jack was an avid outdoorsman supporting conservation efforts and spending many days hunting, fishing and recreating in the forests, lakes, streams, marshes and fields.
