Mom has followed Dad into eternal rest, after a long and well-lived life here with us. Predeceased by her husband, George Klein, in 2009, Mom almost made it to her 60th Mothers' Day. Mom is survived by her children, Peg (Gary) Blackman, Bob (Faith) Klein, and Patty (Doug) Farro; and her grandchildren, Val (Dave) Ambrosh, Matt (Becky) Blackman, Steve (Kayla) Blackman, Angela (Stanley) Trela, Amanda & Amy Farro. She had three great-granchildren, Tyler and Addy Ambrosh and Alivia Blackman, and she missed the upcoming birth of two little boys in May and July, Amanda and Garrett's wedding in July, and Amy becoming Dr. Amy in 2016. Mom taught us to cook everything from scratch, knit & sew, and if you didn't have it in your garden, you went to a U-Pick and got your own - and a lot of it! We all have at least one of her beautiful hand-made quilts. Mom filled in on our softball team at the age of 50, and enjoyed playing pinochle, cribbage and double solitaire on the family room floor. She was an enthusiastic golfer at the IBM Country Club and Homestead, and we pretended to know what hole she was talking about. She never had dogs as pets growing up, but she made up for it later, with Eloise, Ruby and Penny. Mom loved spending summers at Cayuga Lake, where she kept the dock free of weeds and seagulls. In honor of Mom's wishes, there will be no services. Memorial contributions may be made to the Carly Fund at Vestal Veterinary, 2316 Vestal Parkway East, Vestal, NY 13850, or to the charity of your choice .<br>
