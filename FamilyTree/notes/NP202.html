<h2>Notes</h2>
Richard Howard GILMAN
<p>
<a name ="I003437"><b>[I003437]</b></a><br />
He and Leila were missionaries in Cameroon, West Africa for five years after his graduation from Seminary.  After that they served churches in Toronto, SD, Canton, SD, Pipestone, MN, Windom, MN and Beresford, SD.<br>
-------------------------------<br>
Richard Howard Gilman passed away on Tuesday evening, December 1, 2020, reaching the age of 92 years. After a three month diagnosis with cancer, he died peacefully at home with his beloved wife, Leila and his family by his side.<br>
Richard was born on November 8, 1928, in Sioux Falls, SD to Howard and Helen (Lund) Gilman. As a child and young man, he was involved in music, high school drama and college choir. He graduated from Washington High School, Sioux Falls, in 1946. Richard attended Augustana College from 1946-1950, during which time he met the love of his life, Leila Soderstrom. Married on May 17, 1953 at Skrefsrud Lutheran Church, rural Beresford, they were happily married for over sixty seven years.<br>
After graduating from Augustana College with a degree in Business, Richard worked for Nash Finch for the next year. It was during that year that he felt the call into Christian Ministry. Richard graduated from Luther Seminary, St. Paul, MN, in 1954. His calling led him to the mission field in Cameroon, W. Africa for four years, preceded by a year of language study in Paris, France. His work in Africa brought many diverse experiences, including such endeavors as building a church from brick, reaching remote villages by foot; crossing rivers by night (losing his much-needed glasses in the river in pitch dark, only to be found by Africans who braved the crocodile infested waters).<br>
To Richard and Leilaʼs union came four children: Susan, who was the youngest passenger on the Queen Mary as they departed for Africa; Mari and Tom, born during their years in Cameroon, and Dan, born after their return to the states. Upon their arrival in the states in 1959, Richard served several Lutheran parishes in South Dakota and Minnesota over a period of 61 years. His stateside ministry began in Toronto, SD, followed by parishes in Canton, SD, Pipestone, MN, Windom, MN, Beresford, SD, Sioux Falls, SD and Brandon, SD. His final call, in Fairview, SD, was completed in August of 2020.<br>
Richard was a gifted preacher, known for his commanding voice; and dedicated his life to teaching the message of the Gospel of Jesus Christ. He loved spending any time he could with family, whether at home, at the lake cabin (where many fishing legends were born), or on family trips. His subtle sense of humor was often more pronounced during family gatherings, and will always be fondly remembered by family members. His personality and ministry made a lasting impact on every community in which he served, and he is widely and fondly remembered as a pastor and friend.<br>
Preceding Richard in death were parents, Howard and Helen Gilman; sister, Mildred Gilman; and daughter, Susan Norton.<br>
Surviving and grateful for sharing his life are his wife, Leila Gilman; daughter, Mari Schwarting; son, Thomas (Patty) Gilman; son, Daniel (Sheila) Gilman; grandchildren, Olivia, Angelyn, Jacob, Benjamin, Sara, Matthew, Laura, Austin, Braelyn, Zachary and Jackson; and eight great-grandchildren; and numerous other relatives and friends who will dearly miss him.<br>
A service to celebrate Richardʼs life and home-going will be held at Redeemer Free Lutheran Church in Canton, SD, on Monday, December 7, at 11:00 a.m., with burial following at the Skrefsrud Lutheran Cemetery, rural Beresford. Visitation will be at the church, one hour before the service.<br>

Susan Renee GILMAN
<p>
<a name ="I003438"><b>[I003438]</b></a><br />
Service: A Memorial services will begin at 2:00 p.m. Sunday, March 10th at Redeemer Free Lutheran Church, Canton, SD. Family will greet visitors one hour prior to the service.<br>
Susan Renee Gilman was born September 6, 1954, in Sioux Falls, South Dakota to Richard and Leila Gilman. At the age of six weeks she accompanied her parents to Paris, France, and lived there while her parents studied the French language in preparation for ministry in French Cameroon, West Africa. Soon after her first birthday the family moved to Africa to fulfill a five-year commitment of missionary work. During the next four years Susan learned to speak fluently in both English and the native language of the people in that area and enjoyed playing with her little African friends.<br>
After returning to the United States she attended school, first in Toronto, SD, then Canton, SD, and graduated from Augustana Academy in 1971. After graduation she attended the Lutheran Bible Institute, Seattle, WA, for one semester, followed by a semester at Wayne State University, Wayne, Nebraska, and a semester at SD State University, Brookings, SD.<br>
On December 27, 1973, she was married to Edwin Norton in Pipestone, MN. The couple lived and worked in Springfield, MO, for a while, then returned to Sioux Falls. During the next four years they became parents to two daughters, Olivia Dawn and Angelyn Mari. In search of more job security Susan enrolled and graduated from Stewart's School of Hair-Styling and began her career with all the skills needed to satisfy both women and men in their choices of hair styles. As a change of pace in the midst of this career she worked at Citibank for four and one-half years and also one year at Dakota Abilities. Returning to her career of choice her schedule was quickly filled, often extending into evening hours. Her entire family benefitted from her skills; she especially enjoyed meeting the requests of her nephews who requested a haircut in the style of whatever role model they held in admiration at that time.<br>
Susan loved animals and could rightfully be called the "cat whisperer". She insisted that her cats understood every word she spoke to them and it was obvious that she understood them. During the final days of her illness "Woody" lay beside her on her bed, day and night.<br>
November 20, 2018, Susan was diagnosed with advanced cancer already spread throughout her body. She accepted this diagnosis with peace, expressing her willingness to be used for whatever purpose God may choose. On Feb. 28, 2019, her family stood by her bed as Jesus welcomed her into her home in heaven. She will be greatly missed by her loving family, her loyal co-workers and clients and many other friends. Survivors include her parents, Pastor Richard and Leila Gilman, daughters Olivia Ubersteigen (Schwei) and Angie Gobar (Sean); one granddaughter Mya Renee Gobar; one sister, Mari Schwarting; two brothers, Pastor Tom Gilman (wife Patty); and Dan Gilman (wife, Sheila); Ed Norton and five nieces and six nephews.<br>
