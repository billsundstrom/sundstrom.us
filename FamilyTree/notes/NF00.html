On November 1, 1938, Paul Creel and Nellie Rowe were married at the Tal- ent Community Hall. It was a simple service. They lived and worked on a ranch in Dufur, Oregon, for about six years. There Nellie fed a dozen ranch hands and Paul plowed the fields with a team of eight horses. When the war broke out they moved to Seattle where Paul worked at the Boeing Air Field. Along the way Nellie gave birth to two lovely daughters.<br>
After the war they moved to Eastern Oregon and eventually to the Rogue Valley. In 1949 the Creels moved to the house on Creel Lane (named after them). Dennis was born while they lived there. Paul served on the Talent/ Phoenix school board in the 70s and retired from Boise Cascade Sawmill in the 70s. Nellie was a stay at home mom, ready with a hot breakfast & cookies after school. They have 3 chil- dren, 8 grandchildren and 13 great grandchildren.<br>
Paul and Nellie have been members of this church for over 55 years. They have served as leaders in about every area of church life. Nellie is a vital part of the Piece Corp and Paul is an Elder Emeritus. We salute these two wonderful be- lievers and thank them for modeling the Christian life. May God richly bless you both and grant you even more years of love and harmony. Praise the Lord!<br>

Nellie and Paul Creel arrived in Talent in 1949 to find work in one of the many sawmills around here at that time. Their little girls were only 9 and 3 years old, a son was born here two years later. Neighbors with the last names of Pancake, Tycksen and Denomas lived in the same section of town, but the street had no name. When Mae Lowe, a coauthor of the famous paper Talent News Flashes, delivered the newspaper to the Creels, she became frustrated by the lack of a name for the road. Mae didnʼt want to call it Pancake Lane, so she went down to the county offices and had the name of Creel Road put down on the map. The first time Creels knew there was a road named for them was when the sign went up. They have lived there ever since.<br>

Raymond & Marjorie METZGER<br>
It was love at first sight in a Louisville, KY soda shop, and then she moved to Seattle. After only a few letters and 6 weeks, he traveled cross-country to marry her! That was August, 1938. After 71 years of marriage, he still sang her love songs daily and neither could stand to be apart for more than a few hours. Marjorie passed away in October 2009 at the age of 89, and Ray was totally lost without her. He followed just three months later at the age of 94. Thanks to the wonderful salvation found in Jesus Christ, they are together again! Ray & Marge enjoyed living in the Puget Sound area since 1941 where they owned and operated Ray's Custom Meats for over 30 years, mostly in the West Seattle area. They loved their four children, seven grandchildren and five great-grandchildren. They last resided in Edmonds.<br>
