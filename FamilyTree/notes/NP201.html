<p>
<a name ="I006663"><b>[I006663]</b></a><br />
SIR JOHN GIFFARD, of Brimpsfield, Badgeworth, Stonehouse, Stoke Gifford, and Rockhampton, co. Gloucester, Elston, Orcheston St. George,Sherrington, Ashton, and Broughton Gifford, Wilts, son and heir of Sir Elis GIFFARD, of Brimpsfield, &c. (who died shortly before 2 May 1248)(c1), by his 2nd wife, Alice, sister of Sir John MAUTRAVERS, of Lytchet Matravers, Dorset (a). He was aged 16, or 16 and more, at his father's death (b1). With several other barons, he seized the Bishop of Hereford,11 June 1263, and took him to Eardisley Castle. On 18 August following, he was among those who made a treaty with Edward, the King's son. He had just been appointed, 7 August, by the advice of the Magnates of the Council, Keeper of the castle of St. Briavel and the forest of Dean, during pleasure, and he was pardoned, 18 September following, for all trespasses committed by reason of non-observance of the Provisions of Oxford. He was appointed joint Keeper of the counties of Gloucester,Worcester, and Hereford, 24 December 1263. In 1264 he belonged to the baronial party, and in April, being in command at Kenilworth, he surprised and destroyed Warwick Castle, taking the Earl and Countess prisoners. On 14 May following he was at the battle of Lewes, where he was taken prisoner early in the day, but he had already captured Williamla Zuche. He was one of those prohibited, 16 February 1264/5, from taking part in the tournament at Dunstaple, and ordered to attend a Council on the morrow of Ash Wednesday [19 February] following. He changed sides together with the Earl of Gloucester and others, and was in the King's army at the battle of Evesham, 4 August 1265. In consideration of his services at this battle, he was pardoned, 9 Oct. 1265, for having adhered to Simon de Montfort at the battle of Lewes, and for all other trespasses committed up to the said 9 October. He was one of the commissioners empowered, 24 April 1274, to make a truce at the ford of Montgomery, in a month from Easter [29 April], between Llewelyn ab Gruffyd, Prince of Wales, and Humphrey de Bohun of Brecknock. On 6 November 1281 he had licence to hunt wolves, with his own hounds, throughout all the King's forests in England. He was appointed Keeper of the castle of Llandovery, co. Carmarthen, 9 April 1282, and of that of Builth, co. Brecknock, 14 October following, both during pleasure. On 18 November 1283 the King granted him, in fee, the commote of Is-cennen, co. Carmarthen, to hold by the service of a knight's fee: and, on 8 February 1289/90, the castle of Dynevor in that county, for life, as a refuge for himself and his men: he was ordered to deliver this castle to Walter de Pederton, 29 July 1297.He was present at the assemblies held at Berwick in October and November1297, to discuss the various claims to the Crown of Scotland. He was Captain of Podensac in Gascony, which town he surrendered to the French, in 1294/5. He was summoned for Military Service from 18 July 1257 to 7May 1299, to attend the K ing at Shrewsbury, 28 June 1283, to attend theKing at Salisbury, 26 January 1296/7, to a Military Council, 20 August 1297, and to Parliament from 24 June 1295. to 10 April 1299, by writs directed Johanni Giffard, or Gyffard, occasionally with the addition de Brimmesfeld', whereby he is held to have become LORD GIFFARD.<br>
<br>
He was affianced, at the age of 4 years, to Aubrey DE CAUMVILLE (who was about the same age), but he did not marry her (b2). He married, 1stly,Maud [c2], widow of Sir William LUNGESPEE, of Amesbury, Aldbourne, and Trowbridge, Wilts, Canford, Dorset, Bicester, Oxon; Brattleby, co.,Lincoln, &c. (who died between 23 December 1256 and 3 January 1256/7], and daughter and heir of Sir Walter DE CLIFFORD, of Clifford co.Hereford, Cortham, Salop, &c., by Margaret, daughter of Llewelyn abI ORWERTH, PRINCE OF NORTH WALES. She, who was living 1 December 1281,died s.p.m., not long afterwards. He married, 2ndly, in 1286, Margaret,widow of Sir John DE NEVILLE, of Hallingbury, Wethersfield, Great Totham, Great Wakering and Langharn, Essex, Alphington, Devon, &c. who died shortly before 20 May 1282. He died at Boyton, Wilts, 29 May, and was buried 11 June 1299 in Malmesbury Abbey. His widow's dower was ordered to be assigned, 1 August 1299, and on 5 August she was assigned the manors of Stonehouse, Stoke Gifford, Elston, and Broughton Gifford. She died shortly before 13 December 1338. [Complete Peerage V:639-44, (transcribedby Dave Utzinger)]<br>
<br>
(c1) In 1221 this Elis stated that "Osbertus Giffard, antecessor suus quivenit ad conquestum Angl' tenuit manerium de Bimesfeld' . . . et post eumElias flius suus . . . et post eum Elias filius illius Elie et patersuus." At least one generation is here omitted. The Elis living in 1221 was son and heir of Elis III, by Maud, daughter of Morice fitz Robertfitz Hardinge, of Berkeley: which Elis III owed 100 marks 'pro fine terresue' in 1166 and died before Michaelmas 1190, when William le Mareschalowed 140 marks for the custody of the lands of Elis Giffard. Elis III wasson and heir of Elis II (who became a monk in Gloucester Abbey), by Berta(living 1167), sister of Walter de Clifford, of Clifford and Glasbury,and daughter of Richard fitz Ponce. In 1130 Elis II rendered account of100 marks of silver for the relief of his father's lands, being son and heir of Elis I, by Ala, his wife. Before 1096 Elis I had succeeded his father Osbern Giffard, the Domesday tenant of Brimpsfield, Stoke, Rockhampton, Elston, Orcheston, etc.<br>
<br>
(a) John Mautravers gave the manor of Ashton and the advows on of thechurch of Saint Peter at Codford, Wilts, to Elis Giffard in free marriage with Alice his sister, to hold to them and their heirs of their bodies, by the service of a knight's fee.<br>
<br>
(b1) "Elias Giffard". He held the manor of Winterburne (now Elston), ofthe King in chief, as the head of his barony; the manor of Sherringtonpertaining to that barony; and that of Ashton, held of John Mautravers in free marriage. Heir [name cut away] his son aged 16 [rest cut away]. Theproof of age of this heir, John Giffard, is undated and defective, but it states that he was born on the day of St. Wulstan (19 Jan).<br>
<br>
(b2) So the proof of age mentioned above. She was probably the Aubrey deCanville, a nun of Polesworth, who was elected Abbess in Dec 1276 or inthe following month. The marriage was contracted at Arrow, co. Warwick,and she must have been a daughter of Thomas de Camville, of Arrow, and a descendant of Aubrey Marmion, Lady of Arrow, wife of William deCaumville.<br>
<br>
[c2] Maud Lungespee notified the King that John Giffard had abducted her from her manor of Canford, Dorset, and taken her against her will to his castle of Brimpsfield, and there detained her. John appeared before the King, and professed himself ready to prove that he did not abduct her against her will, and offered a fine of 300 marks for the marriage already contracted, as it was said, between them, provided she made no further complaint against him. On 10 March 1270/1 the King ordained thatif she were not content, the said fine should be void, and John should stand his trial at a month from Easter. And as she was too unwell toappear before the King, commissioners were sent to inquire into the truth of the matter, and to certify the King thereof. John and Maud, and her Ist husband, William Lungespee, were all descended from Richard fitzPonce. Why John Giffard should have referred to himself as being of therace of Le Lungespee as in the proof of age mentioned above he is said to have done-is not explicable; unless, indeed, the so briquet was derived from the family of Clifford.<br>

Donald James Gillespie went home to be with the Lord on Tuesday, December 3, 2013. He was 92. He passed away peacefully at his Selma area farm where he had lived since the age of six. A native of Kingsburg, Donald was born in the old Kingsburg Sanitarium to Nathanial and Dorothea Gillespie. The first six years of his life were spent on his family's farm in Caruthers. In 1928, they moved to a ranch near Selma and lived in a home built by his grandfather, Jens Petersen. They farmed grapes and made raisins. Donald graduated from Selma High School and attended Reedley College. He married his high school sweetheart, Gola May Brown, in 1942, a union of 71 years. They made their home on the family farm he had known since his youth. Donald earned his A&E license and worked as an airplane mechanic for the United States Air Force in Sacramento and San Bernardino before being drafted into the United States Navy toward the end of World War II. After an honorable discharge, he returned to Selma. He worked on planes at the Visalia Airport and ran his own airplane repair business near a makeshift landing strip on the family's Selma farm. In the late 1940's, Donald and longtime friend, Warren Rasmussen, started Mountian View Body Shop. That business was also located on the Gillespie farm. Eventually, he expanded the business to include Don's Auto Wrecking at the same location. In the 1960's, Donald started farming and bought several vineyard and business properties in the Selma and Hanford area. Donald was baptized in the Methodist Church in Caruthers and was a member of Pella Lutheran Church of Selma and confirmed there as a youth. Later he was a member of the United Presbyterian Church of Fowler, which merged with Fowler Presbyterian Church. Donald enjoyed the love and laughter of frequent family gatherings. As a young man, Donald loved to fish the streams of the Sierras and the family spent many good times at their small cabin in Wilsonia and hiking through Converse Basin. He was an avid reader and bird watcher.

Walter Scott GILLETTE
<p>
<a name ="I023519"><b>[I023519]</b></a><br />
Walter Scott Gillette, my grandfather, was born in Wisconsin, the youngest of 5 brothers. My grandmother, Ellen McKeown, was born in Moyarget, Co Antrim, Northern Ireland. I believe they met when Walter got a job keeping house for Uncle Jim (James Norris Gillette). Ellen was only 16 and Walter was about the same age.<br>
The Gillettes came to California about 1892. James Norris Gillette, Walter's brother, came to California first. He was an attorney and had apprenticed in Wisconsin. Upon arriving in California, he opened a law office and then sent for his parents and younger brothers. James became a state senator, then the governor of California from l907 to l911. He was the one who used to watch out for my grandpa Walter. He got him several jobs, the last of which was at San Quentin as, I believe, a disbursement officer.<br>
Prior to this, Walter had worked in the woods, in Eureka, then became Depot Master at the train station there. After that, he became a Federal Marshall and the family moved to San Francisco. He didn't like the traveling, that his job entailed, and being away from his family, so, in 1907, they moved to San Quentin. In those days they operated under the "spoils" system, so whoever got in could oust the "outs"! He moved my grandfather's family to San Quentin.<br>
Walter and Ellen Gillette had four children: Gertrude Ellen Gillette (White), Royal Walter Gillette, Dorothy Lydia Gillette (Morey) and John McKeown Gillette, who was born in San Quentin.<br>

An interview with Dorothy White Cowan & Phil Zubler<br>
By Jana McPherson Black<br>
Jason D. White and Mary Frances Baltic White were Dorothy's paternal grandparents. Her grandfather had come to San Quentin from Folsom in 1899. Dorothy's father, Walter was born at San Quentin in a two story house next to teh old McGuirk Store that still stands today in the village. Additionally, Dorothy's mother's parents, Walter Scott Gillette and Ellen McKoewn (an Irish woman) came to live at San Quentin in 1907.<br>
Dorothy's mother, Gertrude Ellen Gillette and her father, Charles Baltic White, married after growing up together on the Prison grounds. Charles had lived outside the gates as a young man and had gone to school with Gertruse. Once married, the newly weds first lived together at the Bay View Hotel during the 1920s and 30s. Charles worked at the Jute Mill initially, then as a guard up on the wall at Post #4.<br>
Dorothy recalls going to McGuirk's store where Mr. McGuirk got barrels of beans down form way up high.<br>
Phil  Zubler, son of  Ernest  Zubler moved to San Quentin in 1913. His mother, Grace Jennie Duffy has moved to live on prison grounds in 1895. Ernest Zubler worked first as a guard then in 1915 as a sack inspector, then in 1919 as Supervisor at the Jute Mill.<br>
Walter Gillette was the prison Distribution Officer who ran the clothing factory in the days when inmates wore stripes. <br>

George (Larry) Gillick , sheriff of Butte County for 32 years, died Thursday night at a World War II veterans' reunion in Long Beach, county officials reported. He was 77.<br>
Friends told officials that Gillick , a resident of Chico, was watching the World Series telecast when he was stricken, apparently by a heart attack, aboard the New Orleans, on which he had served with a Marine Corps detachment during the war.<br>
Gillick also served as president of the California Peace Officers' Association and the California State Sheriffs' Association.<br>
Wood said he served 24 years under Gillick in the Butte County Sheriff's Department, beginning in 1959. Gillick was sheriff from Jan. 8, 1951, to Jan. 3, 1983, having been elected eight times and opposed only twice.<br>
He was known for never carrying a gun. On one occasion, he felled a fleeing suspect with a well-aimed rock.<br>
"Being an ex-baseball player, he felt he was more proficient with a handful of rocks than with a gun," Wood said.<br>
Gillick , a graduate of Sacramento High School, played professional baseball in the 1930s. He pitched for Sacramento, Oakland and San Diego in the Pacific Coast League until a sore arm spoiled his major league prospects in 1936, Wood said.<br>
Later, Gillick became a leader in youth sports activities, including Little League baseball and Pop Warner football. He was also active in toy and bicycle drives for youngsters during holidays.<br>
He inaugurated pancake breakfasts in the department, and at the request of civic groups, would bring a truck trailer with a kitchen to serve the meals for various charities.<br>
Gillick is survived by his wife, Sue, and two sons: Pat, general manager of the Toronto Bluejays baseball team, and Mitch, of Sacramento.<br>
Funeral arrangements are pending.<br>
