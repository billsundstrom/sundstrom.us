<h2>Notes</h2>
Igor of KIEV
<p>
<a name ="I005551"><b>[I005551]</b></a><br />
Igor Riurikovich, or Ingvar RÃ¶reksson, ruled Kievan Rus from 912 to 945. Very little is known about him from the Primary Chronicle. It has been speculated that the chroniclers chose not to enlarge on his reign, as the region was dominated by Khazaria at that time. That he was Rurik's son is also questioned on chronological grounds.<br>
<br>
He twice besieged Constantinople, in 941 and 944, and concluded with the Emperor a favourable treaty whose text is preserved in the chronicle. Igor was killed by Drevlians in 945 and revenged by his wife, Olga of Kiev.<br>

Iziaslav Yaroslavich of KIEV
<p>
<a name ="I007807"><b>[I007807]</b></a><br />
Iziaslav Yaroslavich (1024-1078), Prince of Turaw, Grand Prince of Kiev (since 1054), the oldest son of Yaroslav I the Wise. Iziaslav was one of the authors of "Pravda Yaroslavichey" - a part of the first Russian legal code called Russkaya Pravda.<br>
<br>
In 1043 his father Prince Yaroslav made an agreement with King Casimir I of Poland that recognized Cherven as part of Kiev. The agreement was sealed with a double marriage-Casimir to Dobronega, Yaroslav's sister; and Iziaslav to Gertrude, Casimir's sister. From this marriage was born Iziaslav's son Yaropolk. His other son, Sviatopolk, was illegitimate.<br>
<br>
As a result of the popular uprising in 1068, Iziaslav was deposed and fled to Poland. In 1069 he retook Kiev with the help the Polish army, however, he was ousted again by his brothers in 1073. Iziaslav turned to German emperor, Polish king and the Pope for help on several occasions. In 1077 he succeeded in retaking Kiev once again, but soon died in an internecine war against princes Oleg Svyatoslavich and Boris Vyacheslavich.<br>

Mstislav I Vladimirovich of KIEV
<p>
<a name ="I015169"><b>[I015169]</b></a><br />
From Wikipedia<br>
Mstislav I Vladimirovich the Great  (June 1, 1076 - April 14, 1132), was the Grand Prince of Kiev (1125-1132), the eldest son of Vladimir Monomakh by Gytha of Wessex. He figures prominently in the Norse Sagas under the name Harald, taken to allude to his grandfather, Harold II of England.<br>
St Nicholas Cathedral, built by Mstislav I near his palace at Yaroslav's Court, Novgorod, contains 12th-century frescoes depicting his illustrious family<br>

<br>
As his father's future successor, Mstislav reigned in Novgorod the Great from 1088-93 and (after a brief stint at Rostov) from 1095-1117. Thereafter he was Monomakh's co-ruler in Belgorod-on-the-Dnieper, and inherited the Kievan throne after his death. He built numerous churches in Novgorod, of which St. Nicholas Cathedral (1113) and the cathedral of St Anthony Cloister (1117) survive to the present day. Later, he would also erect important churches in Kiev, notably his family sepulchre at Berestovo and the church of Our Lady at Podil.<br>
<br>
Mstislav's life was spent in constant warfare with Cumans (1093, 1107, 1111, 1129), Estonians (1111, 1113, 1116, 1130), Lithuanians (1131), and the princedom of Polotsk (1127, 1129). In 1096, he defeated his uncle Oleg of Chernigov on the Koloksha River, thereby laying foundation for the centuries of enmity between his and Oleg's descendants. Mstislav was the last ruler of united Rus, and upon his death, as the chronicler put it, "the land of Rus was torn apart".<br>
<br>
In 1095, Mstislav wed Princess Christine of Sweden, daughter of King Ingold I. They had many children:<br>
   1. Ingeborg of Kiev, married Canute Lavard of Jutland, and was mother to Valdemar I of Denmark<br>
   2. Malmfrid, married (1) Sigurd I of Norway; (2) Eric II of Denmark<br>
   3. Eupraxia, married Alexius I Comnenus<br>
   4. Vsevolod of Novgorod<br>
   5. Maria, married Vsevolod II of Kiev<br>
   6. Iziaslav II of Kiev<br>
   7. Rostislav of Kiev<br>
   8. Sviatopolk of Pskov<br>
   9. Rogneda, married Yaroslav of Volinya<br>
  10. Xenia, married Briachislav of Izyaslawl<br>
<br>
Christine died on January 18, 1122; later that year Mstislav married again, to the daughter of Dmitry Zavidich, a nobleman of Novgorod. Their children were:<br>
   1. Vladimir II Mstislavich (1132-1171)<br>
   2. Euphrosyne of Kiev, married King Geza II of Hungary<br>
</p>
Olga of KIEV
<p>
<a name ="I005552"><b>[I005552]</b></a><br />
Olga (also called Olga Prekrasa, or Olga the Beauty, Old Norse: Helga) (died July 11, 969 in Kiev) was a Pskov woman of Varangian extraction who married the future Igor of Kiev, arguably in 903.<br>
<br>
The Primary Chronicle gives 879 as her date of birth, which is rather unlikely, given the fact that her only son Svyatoslav was probably born some 65 years after that date. She spent great effort to avenge her husband's death at the hands of the Drevlians, and succeeded in slaughtering many of them. After Igor's death, she ruled Kievan Rus as regent (945-c.963) for their son, Svyatoslav.<br>
<br>
She was the first Rus ruler to convert to Christianity, either in 945 or in 957. The ceremonies of her formal reception in Constantinople were minutely described by Emperor Constantine VII in his book De Ceremoniis. After her baptism she took the Christian name Yelena, after the reigning Empress Helena Lekapena.<br>
<br>
Olga was one of the first people of Rus to be proclaimed saint, for her efforts to spread the Christian religion in the country. However, she failed to convert Svyatoslav, and it was left to her grandson and pupil Vladimir I to make Christianity the lasting state religion.<br>
</p>
Sviatoslav I of KIEV
<p>
<a name ="I005549"><b>[I005549]</b></a><br />
From Wikipedia<br>
<br>
Sviatoslav I, Prince of Kiev (c.945 - 972) was the warrior Varangian prince of Kiev, who carved out for himself the largest state in Europe and finally moved his capital to Pereyaslavets in Bulgaria in 969.<br>
<br>
We have no information about Svyatoslav's minority and youth, which he spent reigning in Novgorod. His mother, Saint Olga, ruled as Kievan regent until his majority (c.963). Sviatoslav was notorious as a stubborn pagan who rejected the Christianity, which had been embraced by his mother ca 945.<br>
<br>
Svyatoslav's life was spent with his druzhina in permanent warfare against neighbouring states. During his reign, he created an empire that stretched from the Volga to the Danube. His greatest success was the conquest of Khazaria, which for centuries had been one of the strongest states of Eastern Europe. By 965 he also defeated the Volga Bulgars, thus bringing under Kievan control the entire area of the Volga River. Then, as an ally of the Byzantine Empire, which was at war with the Bulgars, Sviatoslav decisively defeated the Bulgars of the Danube (968), thereby paving the way for victories of Basil the Bulgar-Slayer.<br>
<br>
In moving his capital to Bulgaria, Svyatoslav intended to make it the center of his extensive empire. He was forced to give up the Balkan lands (971), however, in a war with the Byzantine Emperor John I. His unorthodox appearance was noted by the Greeks, who described him as having shaved one side of his head, and having a single large gold earring. During his return from the abysmal Byzantine campaign, Sviatoslav was ambushed and killed by the Pechenegs (972). According to the Primary Chronicle, his skull was made into a chalice by the Pecheneg khan.<br>
<br>
Edward Gibbon upon Svyatoslav's war with Byzantium<br>
The Russian traders had seen the magnificence, and tasted the luxury of the city of the Caesars. A marvellous tale, and a scanty supply, excited the desires of their savage countrymen: they envied the gifts of nature which their climate denied; they coveted the works of art, which they were too lazy to imitate and too indigent to purchase; the Varangian princes unfurled the banners of piratical adventure, and their bravest soldiers were drawn from the nations that dwelt in the northern isles of the ocean. The image of their naval armaments was revived in the last century, in the fleets of the Cossacks, which issued from the Borysthenes, to navigate the same seas for a similar purpose. The Greek appellation of monoxyla, or single canoes, might justly be applied to the bottom of their vessels. It was scooped out of the long stem of a beech or willow, but the slight and narrow foundation was raised and continued on either side with planks, till it attained the length of sixty, and the height of about twelve, feet. These boats were built without a deck, but with two rudders and a mast; to move with sails and oars; and to contain from forty to seventy men, with their arms, and provisions of fresh water and salt fish.<br>
<br>
Yet the threats or calamities of a Russian war were more frequently diverted by treaty than by arms. In these naval hostilities, every disadvantage was on the side of the Greeks; their savage enemy afforded no mercy: his poverty promised no spoil; his impenetrable retreat deprived the conqueror of the hopes of revenge; and the pride or weakness of empire indulged an opinion, that no honour could be gained or lost in the intercourse with Barbarians.<br>
<br>
At first their demands were high and inadmissible, three pounds of gold for each soldier or mariner of the fleet: the Russian youth adhered to the design of conquest and glory; but the counsels of moderation were recommended by the hoary sages. "Be content," they said, "with the liberal offers of Caesar; it is not far better to obtain without a combat the possession of gold, silver, silks, and all the objects of our desires? Are we sure of victory? Can we conclude a treaty with the sea? We do not tread on the land; we float on the abyss of water, and a common death hangs over our heads."<br>
<br>
The memory of these Arctic fleets that seemed to descend from the polar circle left deep impression of terror on the Imperial city. By the vulgar of every rank, it was asserted and believed, that an equestrian statue in the square of Taurus was secretly inscribed with a prophecy, how the Russians, in the last days, should become masters of Constantinople. In our own time, a Russian armament, instead of sailing from the Borysthenes, has circumnavigated the continent of Europe; and the Turkish capital has been threatened by a squadron of strong and lofty ships of war, each of which, with its naval science and thundering artillery, could have sunk or scattered a hundred canoes, such as those of their ancestors. Perhaps the present generation may yet behold the accomplishment of the prediction, of a rare prediction, of which the style is unambiguous and the date unquestionable.<br>
<br>
By land the Russians were less formidable than by sea; and as they fought for the most part on foot, their irregular legions must often have been broken and overthrown by the cavalry of the Scythian hordes. Yet their growing towns, however slight and imperfect, presented a shelter to the subject, and a barrier to the enemy: the monarchy of Kiow, till a fatal partition, assumed the dominion of the North; and the nations from the Volga to the Danube were subdued or repelled by the arms of Swatoslaus, the son of Igor, the son of Ruric. The vigour of his mind and body was fortified by the hardships of a military and savage life. Wrapped in a bear-skin, Swatoslaus usually slept on the ground, his head reclining on a saddle; his diet was coarse and frugal, and, like the heroes of Homer, his meat (it was often horse-flesh) was broiled or roasted on the coals. The exercise of war gave stability and discipline to his army; and it may be presumed, that no soldier was permitted to transcend the luxury of his chief.<br>
<br>
By an embassy from Nicephorus, the Greek emperor, he was moved to undertake the conquest of Bulgaria; and a gift of fifteen hundred pounds of gold was laid at his feet to defray the expense, or reward the toils, of the expedition. An army of sixty thousand men was assembled and embarked; they sailed from the Borysthenes to the Danube; their landing was effected on the Maesian shore; and, after a sharp encounter, the swords of the Russians prevailed against the arrows of the Bulgarian horse. The vanquished king sunk into the grave; his children were made captive; and his dominions, as far as Mount Haemus, were subdued or ravaged by the northern invaders.<br>
<br>
But instead of relinquishing his prey, and performing his engagements, the Varangian prince was more disposed to advance than to retire; and, had his ambition been crowned with success, the seat of empire in that early period might have been transferred to a more temperate and fruitful climate. Swatoslaus enjoyed and acknowledged the advantages of his new position, in which he could unite, by exchange or rapine, the various productions of the earth. By an easy navigation he might draw from Russia the native commodities of furs, wax, and hydromed: Hungary supplied him with a breed of horses and the spoils of the West; and Greece abounded with gold, silver, and the foreign luxuries, which his poverty had affected to disdain. The bands of Patzinacites, Chozars, and Turks, repaired to the standard of victory; and the ambassador of Nicephorus betrayed his trust, assumed the purple, and promised to share with his new allies the treasures of the Eastern world. From the banks of the Danube the Russian prince pursued his march as far as Adrianople; a formal summons to evacuate the Roman province was dismissed with contempt; and Swatoslaus fiercely replied, that Constantinople might soon expect the presence of an enemy and a master.<br>
<br>
Nicephorus could no longer expel the mischief which he had introduced; but his throne and wife were inherited by John Zimisces, who, in a diminutive body, possessed the spirit and abilities of a hero. The first victory of his lieutenants deprived the Russians of their foreign allies, twenty thousand of whom were either destroyed by the sword, or provoked to revolt, or tempted to desert. Thrace was delivered, but seventy thousand Barbarians were still in arms; and the legions that had been recalled from the new conquests of Syria, prepared, with the return of the spring, to march under the banners of a warlike prince, who declared himself the friend and avenger of the injured Bulgaria. The passes of Mount Haemus had been left unguarded; they were instantly occupied; the Roman vanguard was formed of the immortals (a proud imitation of the Persian style), the emperor led the main body of ten thousand five hundred foot; and the rest of his forces followed in slow and cautious array, with the baggage and military engines. The first exploit of Zimisces was the reduction of Marcianopolis, or Peristhlaba, in two days; the trumpets sounded; the walls were scaled; eight thousand five hundred Russians were put to the sword; and the sons of the Bulgarian king were rescued from an ignominious prison, and invested with a nominal diadem.<br>
<br>
After these repeated losses, Swatoslaus retired to the strong post of Drista, on the banks of the Danube, and was pursued by an enemy who alternately employed the arms of celerity and delay. The Byzantine galleys ascended the river, the legions completed a line of circumvallation; and the Russian prince was encompassed, assaulted, and famished, in the fortifications of the camp and city. Many deeds of valour were performed; several desperate sallies were attempted; nor was it till after a siege of sixty-five days that Swatoslaus yielded to his adverse fortune. The liberal terms which he obtained announce the prudence of the victor, who respected the valour, and apprehended the despair, of an unconquered mind. The great duke of Russia bound himself, by solemn imprecations, to relinquish all hostile designs; a safe passage was opened for his return; the liberty of trade and navigation was restored; a measure of corn was distributed to each of his soldiers; and the allowance of twenty-two thousand measures attests the loss and the remnant of the Barbarians.<br>
<br>
After a painful voyage, they again reached the mouth of the Borysthenes; but their provisions were exhausted; the season was unfavourable; they passed the winter on the ice; and, before they could prosecute their march, Swatoslaus was surprised and oppressed by the neighbouring tribes with whom the Greeks entertained a perpetual and useful correspondence. Far different was the return of Zimisces, who was received in his capital like Camillus or Marius, the saviours of ancient Rome. But the merit of the victory was attributed by the pious emperor to the mother of God; and the image of the Virgin Mary, with the divine infant in her arms, was placed on a triumphal car, adorned with the spoils of war, and the ensigns of Bulgarian royalty. Zimisces made his public entry on horseback; the diadem on his head, a crown of laurel in his hand; and Constantinople was astonished to applaud the martial virtues of her sovereign.<br>

Svyatopolk II Izyaslavich of KIEV
<p>
<a name ="I007805"><b>[I007805]</b></a><br />
Svyatopolk II Izyaslavich (1050-April 16, 1113) was a supreme ruler of Kievan Rus for 20 years, from 1093 to 1113. He was not a popular prince and his reign was marked by incessant rivalry with his cousin Vladimir Monomakh. Upon his death the Kievan citizens raised a rebellion against the Jewish merchants and Varangian officials who speculated in grain and salt.<br>
<br>
Svyatopolk was the illegitimate1 son of Izyaslav Yaroslavich by his mistress. During his brother Yaropolk's life, Svyatopolk was not regarded as a potential claimant to the Kievan throne. In 1069 he was sent to Polotsk, a city briefly taken by his father from the local ruler Vseslav, and then he spent ten years (1078-88) ruling Novgorod. Upon his brother's death he succeeded him in Turov, which would remain in possession of his descendants until the 17th century.<br>
<br>
When Vsevolod Yaroslavich died in 1093, Svyatopolk was acknowledged by other princes as a senior Grand Duke's son and permitted to ascend the Kievan throne. Although he participated in the princely congresses organized by Vladimir Monomakh, he is sometimes charged with encouraging internecine wars among Rurikid princes. For instance, he sided with his cousin David of Volynia in capturing and blinding one of Halychian princes. He also sided with Vladimir Monomakh in several campaigns against the Kypchaks but was defeated in the Battle of the Stugna River (1097).<br>
<br>
Svyatopolk's Christian name was Michael, so he encouraged embellishment of St Michael's Abbey in Kiev, which has been known as the Golden-Roofed up to the present. The history now known as the Primary Chronicle was compiled by the monk Nestor during Svyatopolk's reign.<br>
<br>
Svyatopolk married twice; to a Bohemian princess and then in 1094 to a daughter of Tugor Khan of the Kypchaks. By his first wife he had two daughters, Zbyslava, whom he married to king Boleslaw III of Poland, and Predslava to Prince Ãlmos of Croatia. His son Yaroslav reigned in Volynia and was married three times - to Hungarian, Polish, and Kievan princesses. In consequence of Yaroslav's early death, his descendants forfeited any right to the Kievan throne and had to content themselves with Turov and Pinsk.<br>
</p>
Vladimir I of KIEV
<p>
<a name ="I007742"><b>[I007742]</b></a><br />
Saint Vladimir Svyatoslavich the Great (c.958-1015) was the grand prince of Kiev who converted to Christianity in 988, and proceeded to baptise the whole Kievan Rus. His name is known in three traditions: in Old East Slavic and modern Ukrainian as Volodymyr, in Old Church Slavonic and modern Russian as Vladimir, and in the Norse and modern Scandinavian languages as Valdemar.<br>
<br>
<br>
Bloody way to the throne<br>
Vladimir was the youngest son of Svyatoslav I by his slave girl Malusha, described in the Norse sagas as a prophetess who lived to the age of 100 and was brought from her cave to the palace to predict the future. Hagiographic tradition of dubious authenticity connects his childhood with the name of his grandmother, Olga Prekrasa, who was Christian and governed the capital during Svyatoslav's frequent military campaigns.<br>
<br>
Transferring his capital to Pereyaslavets in 969, Sviatoslav designated Vladimir ruler of Novgorod the Great but gave Kiev to his legitimate son Yaropolk. After Sviatoslav's death (972), a fratricidal war erupted (976) between Yaropolk and his younger brother Oleg, ruler of the Drevlians. In 977 Vladimir fled to his kinsmen in Scandinavia, collecting as many of the Viking warriors as he could to assist him to recover Novgorod, and on his return the next year marched against Yaropolk.<br>
<br>
On his way to Kiev he sent ambassadors to Rogvolod (Norse: Ragnvald), prince of Polotsk, to sue for the hand of his daughter Rogneda (Norse: Ragnhild). The well-born princess refused to affiance herself to the son of a bondswoman, but Vladimir attacked Polotsk, slew Rogvolod, and took Ragnhild by force. Actually, Polotsk was a key fortress on the way to Kiev, and the capture of Polotsk and Smolensk facilitated the taking of Kiev (980), where he slew Yaropolk by treachery, and was proclaimed konung, or kagan, of all Kievan Rus.<br>
<br>
Years of pagan rule<br>
In addition to his father's extensive domain, Vladimir continued to expand his territories. In 981 he conquered the Cherven cities, the modern Halychyna; in 983 he subdued the Yatvyags, whose territories lay between Lithuania and Poland; in 985 he led a fleet along the central rivers of Russia to conquer the Bulgarians of the Kama, planting numerous fortresses and colonies on his way.<br>
<br>
Though Christianity had won many converts since Olga's rule, Vladimir had remained thorough going pagan, taking eight hundred concubines (besides numerous wives) and erecting pagan statues and shrines to gods. It is argued that he attempted to reform Slavic paganism by establishing thunder-god Perun as a supreme deity. It is probable that he instituted the practice of human sacrifices as well.<br>
<br>
In the year 987, as the result of a consultation with his boyars, Vladimir sent envoys to study the religions of the various neighboring nations whose representatives had been urging him to embrace their respective faiths. The result is amusingly described by the chronicler Nestor. Of the Muslim Bulgarians of the Volga the envoys reported there is no gladness among them; only sorrow and a great stench; their religion is not a good one, as they don't drink wine and eat pork. In the temples of the Germans they saw no beauty; but at Constantinople, where the full festival ritual of the Orthodox Church was set in motion to impress them, they found their ideal: We no longer knew whether we were in heaven or on earth, nor such beauty, and we know not how to tell of it. If Vladimir was impressed by this account of his envoys, he was yet more so by political gains of the Byzantine alliance.<br>
<br>
In 988, having taken the town of Chersones in Crimea, he negotiated for the hand of the emperor Basil II's sister, Anna. Never had a Greek princess married a Barbarian before, as matrimonial offers of French kings and German emperors had been peremptorily rejected. In short, to marry the 27-year-old princess to a pagan Slav seemed impossible. Vladimir, however, was baptized at Chersones, taking the Christian name of Basil out of compliment to his imperial brother-in-law; the sacrament was followed by his marriage with the Roman princess. Returning to Kiev in triumph, he destroyed pagan monuments and established many churches, starting with the splendid Church of the Tithes (989) and monasteries on Mt. Athos.<br>
<br>
He now formed a great council out of his boyars, and set his twelve sons over his subject principalities. With his neighbors he lived at peace, the incursions of the savage Pechenegs alone disturbing his tranquillity. After Anna's death, he married again, most likely to a granddaughter of Otto the Great.<br>
<br>
He died at Berestovo, near Kiev, while on his way to chastise the insolence of his son, Prince Yaroslav of Novgorod. The various parts of his dismembered body were distributed among his numerous sacred foundations and were venerated as relics. One of the largest Kievan cathedrals is dedicated to him. The University of Kiev has rightly been named after the man who both civilized and Christianized Kievan Rus. Eastern Orthodox churches celebrate the feast day of St. Vladimir on 15 July.<br>
<br>
His memory was also kept alive by innumerable folk ballads and legends, which refer to him as Krasno Solnyshko, that is, the Fair Sun. With him the Varangian period of Eastern Slavic history ceases and the Christian period begins.<br>
</p>
Vladimir Monomakh of KIEV
<p>
<a name ="I015172"><b>[I015172]</b></a><br />
Vladimir Monomakh (Russian Christian name Vasiliy, or Basil) (1053 -- May 19, 1125) was undoubtedly the best loved prince of Kievan Rus. He was the son of Vsevolod I by an anonymous daughter of Emperor Constantine IX Monomachos, from whom he takes his nickname of Monomakh ("One who fights alone").<br>
<br>
In his famous Instruction to his own children, Monomakh mentions that he conducted 83 military campaigns and 19 times made peace with the Polovtsi. At first he waged war against the steppe jointly with his cousin Oleg of Chernigov, but after Vladimir was sent by his father to rule Chernigov and Oleg made peace with the Polovtsi to retake that city from him, they parted company. Since that time, Vladimir and Oleg were bitter enemies who would often engage in internecine wars. The enmity continued among their children and more distant posterity.<br>
<br>
From 1094, his chief patrimony was the Southern town of Pereyaslav, although he also controlled Rostov, Suzdal, and other Northern provinces. In these lands he founded several towns, notably his namesake, Vladimir, the future capital of Russia. In order to unite Russian princes in their struggle against the Great Steppe, Vladimir initiated three princely congresses, the most important being held at Lyubech in 1097 and Dolobsk in 1103.<br>
<br>
When Sviatopolk II died in 1113, the Kievan populace revolted and summoned Vladimir to the capital. The same year he entered Kiev to the great delight of crowd and reigned there until his death in 1125. As may be seen from his Instruction, he promulgated a number of reforms in order to allay the social tensions in the capital. These years saw the last flowering of Kievan Rus, which was torn apart 10 years after his death.<br>
<br>
Vladimir was married three times: firstly to Gytha of Wessex, then to a Byzantine noblewoman and finally to a daughter of Kypchak khan. By his first marriage he had Mstislav, his illustrious heir. Among the children by second wife were Yury Dolgoruky, the founder of Moscow, and two daughters: Eufemia who married King Coloman of Hungary and Maria, married to the Byzantine pretender who called himself Leon Diogenes. Vladimir's only sister Praxedis is notorious for her divorce with Emperor Henry IV on the ground that he had attempted a black mass on her naked body.<br>
<br>
Vladimir Monomakh is buried in the Saint Sophia Cathedral in Kiev. Succeeding generations often referred to his reign as the golden age of that city. Numerous legends are connected with Monomakh's name, including the transfer from Constantinople to Rus of such precious relics as Our Lady of Vladimir and the Muscovite crown called Monomakh's Cap.<br>
</p>
Vsevolod I Yaroslavich of KIEV
<p>
<a name ="I005548"><b>[I005548]</b></a><br />
Vsevolod I Yaroslavich (1030 - 13 April 1093) ruled as grand prince of Kiev from 1076 until his death. He was the fourth and favourite son of Yaroslav I the Wise by Ingigerd Olafsdottir. To back up an armistice signed with the Byzantine Empire in 1046, he married a daughter of the Emperor Constantine IX and had by her a son, the future Vladimir Monomakh.<br>
<br>
Upon his father's death in 1054, he received in appanage the towns of Pereyaslav, Rostov, Suzdal, and Beloozero which would remain in possession of his descendants until the end of Middle Ages. Together with his elder brothers Izyaslav and Svyatoslav he formed a sort of princely triumvirate which jointly waged war on the steppe people and compiled the first East Slavic law code. In 1067 Vsevolod's Greek wife died and he presently married a Kypchak princess. She brought him another son, who drowned after the Battle of the Stugna River, and two daughters, one becoming a nun and another Empress of Germany.<br>
<br>
Upon Svyatoslav's death in 1077 he inherited the Kievan throne, but ceded it to the banished Izyaslav in return for his patrimony of Chernigov. Izyaslav died next year and was succeeded by Vsevolod. He was versed in Greek learning and spoke 5 languages. Last years of his reign were clouded by grave illness, and Vladimir Monomakh actually presided over the government.<br>
</p>
Yaroslav I of KIEV
<p>
<a name ="I005539"><b>[I005539]</b></a><br />
From Wikipedia,<br>
<br>
Yaroslav I the Wise (978?-1054) (Christian name: Yury, or George) was thrice prince of Novgorod and Kiev, uniting the two principalities for a time under his rule. During his lengthy reign, Kievan Rus' reached a zenith of its cultural flowering and military power.<br>
<br>
His way to the throne<br>
Early years of Yaroslav's life are enshrouded in mystery. He was one of the numerous sons of Vladimir the Great, presumably his second by Rogneda of Polotsk, although his actual age (as stated in the Russian Primary Chronicle and corroborated by the examination of his skeleton in the 1930s) would place him among the youngest children of Vladimir. It was speculated that he was a child begotten out of wedlock after Vladimir's divorce with Rogneda and his marriage to Anna Porphyrogeneta. Yaroslav figures prominently in the Norse Sagas under the name of Jarisleif the Lame; his legendary lameness (probably result of an arrow wound) was corroborated by the scientists who examined his relics.<br>
<br>
In his youth, Yaroslav was sent by his father to rule the northern lands around Rostov the Great but was transferred to Novgorod the Great, as befitted a senior heir to the throne, in 1010. While living there, he founded the town of Yaroslavl (literally, Yaroslav's) on the Volga. His relations with father were apparently strained, and grew only worse on the news that Vladimir bequeathed the Kievan throne to his younger son, Boris. In 1014 Yaroslav refused to pay tribute to Kiev and only Vladimir's death prevented a war.<br>
<br>
During the next four years Yaroslav waged a complicated and bloody war for Kiev against his half-brother Sviatopolk, who was supported by his father-in-law, king Boleslaus I of Poland. During the course of struggle, several other brothers (Boris and Gleb, Svyatoslav) were brutally murdered. The Primary Chronicle accused Svyatopolk of planning those murders, while the Saga of Eymund is often interpretated as recounting the story of Boris's assassination by the Varangians in the service of Yaroslav. However, the victim's name is given there as Burizlaf, which is also a name of Boleslaus I in the Scandinavian sources. It is thus possible that the Saga tells the story of Yaroslav's struggle against Svyatopolk (whose troops were commanded by the Polish king), and not against Boris.<br>
<br>
Yaroslav defeated Svyatopolk in their first battle, in 1016, and Svyatopolk fled to Poland. But Svyatopolk returned with Polish troops furnished by his father-in-law King Boleslaus of Poland, seized Kiev and pushed Yaroslav back into Novgorod. In 1019, Yaroslav eventually prevailed over Svyatopolk and established his rule over Kiev. One of his first actions as a grand prince was to confer on the loyal Novgorodians (who had helped him to regain the throne), numerous freedoms and privilegies. Thus, the foundation for the Novgorod Republic was laid. The Novgorodians respected Yaroslav more than other Kievan princes and named a veche square after him. It is thought that it was at that period that Yaroslav promulgated the first Russian code of laws, called Yaroslav's Justice.<br>
<br>
His reign<br>
Leaving aside the legitimacy of Yaroslav's claims to the Kievan throne and his postulated guilt in the murder of brothers, Nestor and later Russian historians often represented him as a model of virtue and styled him the Wise. A less appealing side of his personality may be revealed by the fact that he imprisoned his younger brother Sudislav for life. Yet another brother, Mstislav of Tmutarakan, whose distant realm bordered on the Northern Caucasus and the Black Sea, hastened to Kiev and inflicted a heavy defeat on Yaroslav in 1024. Thereupon Yaroslav and Mstislav divided Kievan Rus: the area stretching left from the Dnieper, with the capital at Chernihiv, was ceded to Mstislav until his death in 1036.<br>
<br>
In his foreign policy, Yaroslav relied on the Scandinavian alliance and attempted to weaken the Byzantine influence on Kiev. In 1030 he reconquered from the Poles Red Rus, and concluded an alliance with king Casimir I the Restorer, sealed by the latter's marriage to Yaroslav's sister Maria. In another successful military raid the same year, he conquered the hypothetical Estonian fortress of Tarbatu, built his own fort in that place, which went by the name of Yuriev (after St George, or Yury, Yaroslav's patron saint) and forced the surrounding province of Ugaunia to pay annual tribute (possibly until 1061).<br>
<br>
In 1043 Yaroslav staged a raid against Constantinople led by his son Vladimir. Although the Rus army was defeated, Yaroslav managed to conclude the war with a favourable treaty and prestigious marriage of his son Vsevolod to the emperor's daughter.<br>
<br>
To defend his state from nomadic tribes threatening it from the south he constructed a line of fortifications near the towns of Chersones, Kanev and Pereyaslav. To celebrate his decisive victory over the Pechenegs (who thereupon disappear from history) he sponsored the construction of the Saint Sophia Cathedral in 1037. Other celebrated monuments of his reign, such as the Golden Gates of Kiev, have since perished.<br>
<br>
Yaroslav was a notable patron of book culture and learning. In 1051, he had a Russian monk Ilarion proclaimed the metropolitan of Kiev, thus challenging old Byzantine tradition of placing Greeks on the episcopal sees. Ilarion's discourse on Yaroslav and his father Vladimir is frequently cited as the first work of Old Russian literature.<br>
<br>
Family life and posterity<br>
In 1019, Yaroslav married Ingegerd Olofsdotter, daughter of king of Sweden, and gave Ladoga to her as a marriage gift. There are good reasons to believe that before that time he had been married to a woman named Anna, of disputed extraction.<br>
<br>
In the Saint Sophia Cathedral, one may see a fresco representing the whole family: Yaroslav, Irene (as Ingigerd was known in Rus), their 5 daughters and 5 sons. Yaroslav married three of his daughters to foreign princes who lived in exile at his court: Elizabeth to Harald III of Norway (who had attained her hand by his military exploits in the Byzantine Empire); Anastasia to the future Andrew I of Hungary, and the youngest daughter Anne of Kiev married Henry I of France and was the regent of France during their son's minority. Another daughter may have been the Agatha who married Edward the Exile, heir to the throne of England and was the mother of Edgar Atheling and St. Margaret of Scotland.<br>
<br>
Yaroslav had one son from the first marriage (his Christian name being Ilya), and 6 sons from the second marriage. Apprehending the danger that could ensue from divisions between brothers, he exhorted them to live in peace with each other. The eldest of these, Vladimir of Novgorod, best remembered for building the Saint Sophia Cathedral in Novgorod, predeceased his father. Three other sons - Izyaslav, Svyatoslav, and Vsevolod - reigned in Kiev one after another. The youngest children of Yaroslav were Igor of Volynia and Vyacheslav of Smolensk.<br>

Born In: Woodville, Nova Scotia, Canada<br>
Born: May 3rd, 1913<br>
Passed in: Bridgewater, Nova Scotia, Canada<br>
Passed on: February 2nd, 2012<br>
Joyce Carman Barkhouse, CM, ONS. Born May 3, 1913, in Woodville, Kings County, Nova Scotia, Joyce died February 2, 2012, of heart disease in Bridgewater, Lunenburg County, Nova Scotia. She is predeceased by her husband, Milton Joseph Barkhouse (1915-1968) and all in her immediate Killam family: her father, Harold Edwin Killam, a medical doctor, and her mother, Ora Louise (nÃ©e Webster); sisters Margaret Dorothy (Carl) Atwood, and Kathleen Eleanor (Laverne) Cogswell; brothers Frederick William (Gardy) and Harold Edwin (Edna). She is survived by her son Murray Roy (Eileen), her daughter Janet Louise (Greg Howard), five grandchildren and six great-grandchildren. She will be profoundly missed by them, and by many loved and loving nieces and nephews and their families. After graduating from Kings County Academy at the age of 17, Barkhouse attended the Provincial Normal College in Truro and became an elementary school teacher. She worked in various places in the Maritimes, and later in Montreal. While teaching, she became aware of a lack of Canadian reading material for children, and wrote short stories, poems, and plays to fill this gap. So began a passion that was to earn her national recognition for her pioneer work in the field of Canadian ChildrenÊ¼s Literature. When her husband died after a serious illness, Barkhouse returned from Montreal to Nova Scotia. Her first book, George Dawson: The Little Giant, was published in 1974. Later books for children include Pit Pony, which was made into both a movie and a television series by Cochran Entertainments and aired on CBC, and a childrenÊ¼s picture book, AnnaÊ¼s Pet, which she co-authored with her niece Margaret Atwood. Involved in the formation of the WritersÊ¼ Federation of Nova Scotia (WFNS), and in the early days of The WritersÊ¼ Union of Canada (TWUC), and the Canadian Society of ChildrenÊ¼s Authors, Illustrators and Performers (CANSCAIP), Barkhouse served on the executives of all these groups. She was a founding member of the WFNS "Writers in the Schools" program. Both TWUC and the WFNS gave Barkhouse honourary life membership; the FederationÊ¼s Atlantic Writing Competition prize for childrenÊ¼s writing bears her name. Barkhouse cared deeply about the writing community in her province and country, and will be sadly missed by many younger writers with whom she sustained lasting friendships. Honoured by both her beloved native Nova Scotia and her country, Barkhouse received the Order of Nova Scotia in 2007, and was named a Member of the Order of Canada in 2009. Cremation has taken place; a memorial service for family and friends will be held at a later date. Donations may be made to the WritersÊ¼ Federation of Nova Scotia for their Writers in the Schools program, their Atlantic Writing Competition, or their fund to help support indigent writers; the Harbourville Restoration Society; or charity of choice.<br>

<br>
Joyce Carmen Barkhouse (nee Killam) was born in the Annapolis Valley town of Woodville, Nova Scotia, on 3 May 1913. She was the middle of five children born to Harold Edwin, a rural family physician, and Ora Louise Killam. Barkhouse attended the small rural school in Woodville until grade eleven when she transferred to the KingÊ¼s County Academy in Kentville to complete grade twelve. In 1932, Barkhouse earned her TeacherÊ¼s License from the Provincial Normal College in Truro and began teaching in Sand Hill, Nova Scotia. In 1939, Barkhouse began teaching in Liverpool where she met Milton Joseph Barkhouse, a teller with the Royal Bank of Canada. They married in 1942 and had two children, Murray Roy, and Janet Louise. MiltonÊ¼s position with the Royal Bank took them from Liverpool to Halifax, Charlottetown, and eventually Montreal. Joyce Barkhouse returned to Nova Scotia in 1968 following her husbandÊ¼s death.<br>
<br>
BarkhouseÊ¼s career as a writer began in 1932, when she was nineteen, with the publication of a short story in the Baptist church paper The Northern Messenger. Her subsequent articles and short stories, primarily written for a younger audience, have appeared in a number of church papers, anthologies, textbooks, and periodicals, while her column "For Mothers and Others" appeared in newspapers throughout Nova Scotia from 1973-1976. In 1974, at the age of sixty-one, Barkhouse published her first novel George Dawson: The Little Giant. She has now published a total of eight books, including Pit Pony which was adapted for television in 1997, and AnnaÊ¼s Pet, a childrenÊ¼s book co-authored with niece Margaret Atwood, which was adapted for a puppet play by Mermaid Theatre.<br>
Barkhouse and her work have received provincial and national recognition. In 1993, the Joyce Barkhouse Writing for Children Award was established by the WritersÊ¼ Federation of Nova Scotia (WFNS). She received the Ann Connor Brimer Award from the Nova Scotia Library Association in 1991; the Valuable Contribution to Children's Literature Award from the Nova Scotia Children's Literature Roundtable in 1990; the Marianna Dempster Memorial Award from the Canadian Authors Association in 1989; the Cultural Life Award for outstanding service to the cultural life of Nova Scotia in 1982; and First prize, Children's Fiction from WFNS in 1979.<br>
<br>
Barkhouse continues to reside in Nova Scotia, dividing her time between Bridgewater and Harbourville. <br>

Joyce Barkhouse, was born Joyce Killam on May 3, 1913, in Nova Scotia.  The daughter of a "horse-and-buggy" doctor, Joyce attended a two-room village school in Woodville, Annapolis Valley and went on to study at the Teachers College in Truro.  Joyce's first teaching job was in the Annapolis Valley community of Sandhill (now called East Aylesford) and she taught all subjects in a one-room school comprised of grades one to eleven. Joyce taught full-time for eight years, until she married, and found that her strength was in teaching the early grades.<br>
Joyce came from a horse-loving family - horses in the Webster-Killam clan included Nellie, Goldie, Blackie, Molly, Mighty Maude, Lil Abner and Gem.  Her older sister Margaret (mother of author Margaret Atwood) was a keen horsewoman - she received riding tack, such as saddle and bridle, on her graduations.  Grandfather Webster was a great horse lover, and Joyce recalls how her grandfather was so furious when he encountered a man beating a horse that he jumped out of his wagon and purchased the abused animal on the spot.  He gave the horse, Blackie, to Margaret, and she nursed the poor broken animal back to glossy good health.  Another horse in the Webster-Killam family was Goldie.  She was caught in the Halifax Explosion of 1917.  Goldie belonged to Joyce's uncle Fred.  Fred's family home and flower nursery business were in the north end of Halifax, and his beloved horse lived in barn next to the house.  When the munitions ship Mont Blanc exploded, Fred's business was "blown to smithereens".  At the time, Fred was sick in bed and his wife Rose was temporarily trapped in the basement, but both survived.  Goldie, however, died in the fire.  Nellie was the first horse ridden by Joyce.  Joyce had to deliver medicine to one of her father's patients, and during the ride she learned the lesson of the "loose girth" familiar to many novice riders.<br>
Following her marriage, Joyce lived in Halifax, Charlelottetown and Montreal, and eventually returned to Nova Scotia.  She now lives in the town of Bridgewater, and continues to spend summer days at her cherished Harbourville cottage overlooking the Bay of Fundy.<br>

COGSWELL, Kathleen Eleanor - 94, Berwick, Kings Co., passed away in Valley Regional Hospital, Kentville, on March 15, 2005. Born on December 30, 1910, in Woodville, Kings Co., she was a daughter of the late Dr. Harold Killam and Ora (Webster) Killam. Kathleen graduated from Grade 12 at the age of 14, leading the Maritime Provinces in the Provincial Exams. She graduated with a B.A., cum laude, from Dalhousie University and received her M.A., magna cum laude, from the University of Toronto at 19 years of age. Her academic career was shortened prematurely when she returned to Nova Scotia to care for her father who was recovering from a serious accident. She taught high school at Kings County Academy, Kentville, and later at Berwick High School and Western Kings District High School. Following her marriage she moved to Berwick. She was a loyal and active member of the United Church of Canada receiving a United Church Women's Life Membership. Kathleen was an Elder in the United Church for many years and later an Elder Emeritus. She was an avid bridge player all her life and played up to the time of her death. She was a member of the Acadia University Women's Club, a group she thoroughly enjoyed. She was a long-time member of the Ladies Auxiliary of Western Kings Memorial Hospital. Her definitive history of the hospital was published in 1982. She was very interested in medicine because she was not only the daughter and wife of physicians, but also the mother of two doctors and the mother-in-law of one. She was predeceased by her husband, Dr. Laverne E. Cogswell, and by brothers, Fred and Harold Killam. She is survived by sisters, Margaret Atwood (Senior) and Joyce Barkhouse; children, David (Heide) Cogswell, Eric (Patricia) Cogswell, Elizabeth (Graham) Pineo, Mary (Denton) Graham, Oliver Cogswell, and Suzanne Cogswell (Capt. Ian Smith); 13 grandchildren; 18 great-grandchildren.<br>

Margaret Dorothy KILLAM

<a name ="I025804"><b>[I025804]</b></a><br />
MARGARET ATWOOD<br>
Margaret Dorothy Killam Atwood Mother, dietitian, outdoorswoman. Born June 8, 1909, in Kinsman's Corners, N.S. Died Dec. 30, 2006, in Toronto, of natural causes, aged 97.<br>
Someone said to me recently, "You must have had an unusual mother." True enough.<br>
Margaret Killam was born in 1909 in the Annapolis Valley of Nova Scotia. Her father was a country doctor, and she grew up as a socially shy but physically brave tomboy. Unlike her academically brilliant sister, Kae, she was not a natural student. Her father refused to send her to university because she was "frivolous," so she taught school, saved the money for her own fees, and won a college scholarship, just to show she could.<br>
In 1935, she married Carl Atwood, who'd fallen in love with the sight of her sliding down a banister. They spent their honeymoon canoeing down the Saint John River in New Brunswick, then headed for northern Quebec, where my father ran an insect research station. They lived in tents, then in a cabin built by my father, where my mother raised two small children without benefit of electricity or running water. The winter months were spent in Ottawa, but my mother preferred the bush. She hated hats, tea parties, and housework - in the woods she "just swept the dirt out the door" - and loved swimming in the cold northern lakes and working in the vegetable garden where they grew much of their food. When we ran short, my mother would go down to the end of the dock and throw in a line for pickerel.<br>
In 1945, my parents moved to Sault Ste. Marie, Ont.; my father established the insect lab there. We spent the warmer months in yet another cabin on the shore of Lake Superior. Our mother set up a mammoth berry-preserving operation, and we were set to picking blueberries at a cent a cup. She did not believe in waste or overspending.<br>
Our father was frequently away on insect-collecting trips, and one of my Lake Superior memories is of my mother waving a broom and yelling "Scat!" to chase away a hungry bear that had just trashed our food cache.<br>
After moving to Toronto, where my father taught zoology at the University of Toronto, my parents acquired a third child, after which they took up Scottish country dancing. This wasn't enough for my mother: She added ice dancing to her list of sports, and kept it up until she was 75. When she was 84, she casually informed me that it was time for her to stop climbing up on the roof to get the leaves out of the eaves troughs. "You've been doing what?" I said. She gave me the same stubborn but pleased look she had when, forbidden to shovel snow, she'd have the driveway cleared before you could get over.<br>
My mother loved to read aloud: All three of her children got the benefit. She was a hilarious storyteller and an alarming mimic, although, unlike her sister Joyce Barkhouse, the children's author, she had no interest in writing. She composed only one poem in her life: It was about flying, the kind with wings, a feat she never accomplished.<br>
She was a believer in doing what you thought was right, seeing things through, buttoning your lip when advisable, and enjoying life as much as possible. She was a permissive mother in many ways - mud pies, frogs in jars, and messy paint held no terrors for her - but she discouraged complaining: Even in her last few years, when she was blind and bedridden, she never did it herself.<br>
Shortly before she died, my Aunt Joyce reminded her - in one of her faithful weekly letters - of how she used to handle the blizzards "back home" in Nova Scotia. "Let's go out and fight the storm!" my mother would say. That's one image her many friends will retain of her: M.D.K.A., striding headfirst into the wind, for the joy that was in it.<br>
Writer Margaret Atwood is the daughter of M.D.K.A.<br>
