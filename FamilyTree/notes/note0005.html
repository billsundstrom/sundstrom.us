Jeanne (or Joan or Johanna) of Navarre (c. 1271 - April 4, 1305), QueenConsort of France, was the daughter of king Henry I of Navarre andBlanche of Artois. In 1274, upon the death of her father, she becameCountess of Champagne and Queen Regnant of Navarre. Her mother was herguardian and regent in Navarre. Various powers, both foreign andNavarrese, sought to take advantage of the minority of the heiress andthe weakness of the female regent, which caused Joan and her mother toseek protection at the court of Philip III of France.<br />
 <br />
At the age of 13, Jeanne married his son and heir Philip IV of France on August 16, 1284, becoming Queen of France a year later. The crowns of Navarre and France were henceforth united for almost half a century. Their children were:<br />
   1. Marguerite (1288-1300)<br />
   2. Louis X of France (October 4, 1289 - June 5, 1316)<br />
   3. Blanche (1290-1294)<br />
   4. Philip V of France (1293 - January 3, 1322)<br />
   5. Charles IV of France (1294 - February 1, 1328)<br />
   6. Isabelle (1296 - August 23, 1358), married Edward II of England<br />
   7. Robert (1297 - July 1308)<br />
 <br />
Their three surviving sons would all become Kings of France, in turn, and their only surviving daughter Queen of England. Jeanne herself died under mysterious circumstances; one chronicler even accused her husband of having killed her.<br />

From Wikipedia<br />
 <br />
Ebalus of Aquitaine or Ebles Manzer (ca.870-935) was Count of Poitiers between 901 and 935 and two times Duke of Aquitaine, first between 890 and 893, second from 927 to his death. In the interval, Aquitaine was ruled by Dukes of the house of Auvergne.<br />
 <br />
Ebles was an illegitimate son of Ranulf II of Poitiers by, possibly, a Jewish woman. Mamzer is a Hebrew word meaning "bastard". He married an Emiliene and by her had two sons, Ebalus (Ebles) bishop of Limoges, and William III of Aquitaine.<br />
 <br />
Ebles was established as Comté de Poitiers in 892 by his father Ranulf II, in the presence of Aymar of Poitiers, and supported by Eudes I of France. Ebles gained the favor of William I the Pious, Count of Auvergne, who placed Aquitaine under his authority.<br />
 <br />
In 902, Ebles launched the conquest of his county with an army lent by his distant relative William the Pious. He took Poitiers in the absence of Aymar and established control of the county. He was investitured as Comté de Poitou by Charles the Simple, with whom Ebles was raised.<br />
 <br />
Comté de Poitou was the only title in which he ever had legitimate investiture. Ebles alloted the Abbey of Saint-Maixent to Viscomte Savary de Thouars who had been his constant supporter. He restructured Poitiers by creating new vicomtés in Aulnay and Melle and dissolved the title and position of Viscomte de Poitou upon the death of its holder, Maingaud, in 925.<br />
 <br />
In 904 he conquered the Limousin. In 911 Ebles was in Chartres with an army that opposed Rollon.<br />
 <br />
In 927, William the Younger, heir to William the Pious, and then his successor, his brother Alfred, died in the space of one year. Alfred, having made Ebles his heir, Ebles thus found himself Duke of Aquitaine, Comté du Berry, d'Auvergne and du Velay.<br />
 <br />
In 929, King Raoul started trying to reduce the power of Ebles Manzer. He withdrew from him access to Berry, then in 932 he transfered the titles of Duc d'Aquitaine and Comté d'Auvergne to the Count of Toulouse Raymond III Pons. Moreover the territory of March which was under the control of the Seigneur de Charroux, vassal of Ebles, was transformed into an independent county.<br />

Rhodri the Great a.k.a. Roderick the Great (in Welsh, "Rhodri Mawr") (c. 820-878) was the first ruler of Wales to be called "Great", and the first to rule most of present-day Wales.<br />
 <br />
The son of Merfyn Frych, he inherited the principality of Gwynedd on his father's death in 844, and Powys from his uncle. He proceeded to marry Angharad, daughter of the ruler of Seisyllwg, which he duly inherited on the accidental death of his brother-in-law in 871.<br />
 <br />
Rhodri succeeded in holding off both Viking and Saxon invaders, offering security to his subjects at a time of great danger and unrest throughout the British Isles. It was, however, the Vikings who drove Rhodri away from his home territory in 877, and he fled to Ireland. Returning the following year in an attempt to regain his kingdom, he was killed in battle against the Mercians of Ceolwulf II. Rhodri slew Gorm, a famous Norse viking leader, during a battlefield duel, and shortly afterwards wiped out his army; the slaying of Gorm sent shockwaves across the contemporary Norse world.<br />

Edward II, (April 25, 1284 - October, 1327), of Caernarvon, was king ofEngland from 1307 until deposed in January, 1327. He is rememberedlargely for the brutal method of his murder, which was itself linked tohis homosexuality.<br />
Prince of Wales<br />
 <br />
The fourth son of Edward I of England by his first wife Eleanor of Castile, Edward II was born at Caernarfon Castle. He was the first English prince to hold the title of the Prince of Wales, which was formalized by the Lincoln Parliament of February 7, 1301. (The story that his father presented Edward II as a newborn to the Welsh as their future native prince is unfounded; the story first appeared in the work of 16th century Welsh "antiquary" David Powel.)<br />
 <br />
Edward became heir to the throne when he was just a few months old, upon the death of his elder brother Alfonso. His father, a notable military leader, made a point of training young Edward in warfare and statecraft starting in his childhood. The prince took part in several Scots campaigns, but "all his father's efforts could not prevent his acquiring the habits of extravagance and frivolity which he retained all through his life". The king attributed his sonʼs problems to his lover Piers Gaveston, a Gascon knight. Gaveston was exiled by the king after the then Prince Edward bestowed upon him a title reserved for royalty. Ironically it was the king who had originally chosen Gaveston to be a suitable friend for his son, in 1298. When Edward I died, on July 7, 1307, the first act of the prince, now King Edward II, was to recall Gaveston. His next was to abandon the Scots campaign on which his father had set his heart.<br />
 <br />
King of England<br />
The new king was physically as impressive as his father. He was, however, lacking in drive and ambition and was "the first king after the Conquest who was not a man of business" (Dr. Stubbs). His main interest was in entertainment, though he also took pleasure in athletics and in the practice of mechanical crafts. He had been so dominated by his father that he had little confidence in himself, and was always in the hands of some favourite with a stronger will than his own.<br />
 <br />
In the early years of his reign Gaveston held this role, acting as regent when Edward went to France, where, on January 25, 1308, he married Isabella of France, the daughter of King Philip IV of France, "Philip the Fair"; she was the sister of three French kings. Although Edward and his wife had children, the marriage was doomed to failure almost from the beginning. Isabella was neglected by her husband, who spent much of his time with the few friends he shared power with, conspiring on how to limit the powers of the Peerage in order to consolidate his father's legacy for himself, and so appearing to prefer the company of his male favourites. This led to considerable rumours of Edward being homosexual, which historians generally agree he was. Their marriage nevertheless produced two sons, Edward, and John of Eltham, Earl of Cornwall (1316-1336), and two daughters, Eleanor (1318) and Joanna (1321-1362), wife of David II of Scotland. Edward had also fathered an illegitimate son, Adam FitzRoy, who accompanied his father in the Scottish campaigns of 1312, and who died shortly after September 18, 1322.<br />
 <br />
Piers Gaveston, Earl of Cornwall<br />
Gaveston received the earldom of Cornwall with the hand of the king's niece, Margaret of Gloucester. The barons grew resentful of Gaveston and twice insisted on his banishment. On each occasion Edward recalled his friend, whereupon the barons, headed by the king's cousin Thomas, Earl of Lancaster, went to war against king and favourite and in 1312 assassinated Gaveston. Edward was not strong enough to avenge his loss.<br />
 <br />
He stood aside, allowing the country to come under the rule of a baronial committee of twenty-one lords ordainers, who, in 1311, had drawn up a series of ordinances, which substituted ordainers for the king as the effective government of the country. Parliament meant to the new rulers an assembly of barons just as it had done to the opponents of Edward's grandfather, Henry III, in 1258. The commons was excluded. The effect was to transform England from a monarchy to a narrow oligarchy.<br />
 <br />
Conflict with Scotland<br />
During the quarrels between Edward and the "ordainers", Robert the Bruce was steadily re-conquering Scotland. His progress was so great that he had occupied all the fortresses save Stirling, which he besieged. The danger of losing Stirling shamed Edward and the barons into an attempt to retrieve their lost ground. In June 1314 Edward led a huge army into Scotland in the hope of relieving Stirling. On June 24, his ill-disciplined and badly led force was completely defeated by Bruce at the Battle of Bannockburn. Henceforth Bruce was sure of his position as king of Scots, and took vengeance for Edward I's activities by devastating the northern counties of England.<br />
 <br />
Political factions<br />
Edward II's disgraceful defeat made him more dependent on his barons than ever. Thomas of Lancaster now had an opportunity of saving England from the consequences of the king's incompetence. He had shown some ability as a leader of opposition, but lacked creativity. He was suspected of having made a secret understanding with Bruce, in hopes of keeping the king weak.<br />
 <br />
Before long the opposition split into fiercely contending factions. Under Aymer of Valence, Earl of Pembroke, a middle party arose, which hated Lancaster so much that it supported the king. After 1318, the effect of its influence was to restore Edward to some portion of his authority. However, the king hated Pembroke almost as much as Lancaster, and now found a competent alternative adviser in Hugh le Despenser, 1st Earl of Winchester, a baron of great experience.<br />
 <br />
His son, Hugh the younger Despenser, became a personal friend and favourite, who effectively replaced Gaveston. The fierce hatred which the barons had for the Despensers was equal to their hatred his previous favourite. They were indignant at the privileges Edward lavished upon father and son, especially when the younger Despenser strove to procure for himself the earldom of Gloucester in right of his wife Eleanor de Clare, daughter of Gilbert de Clare, 7th Earl of Hertford and Joan of Acre and niece of Edward II.<br />
 <br />
Rule of the Despensers<br />
In 1321, the barons met in parliament, and under Lancaster's guidance had Hugh le Despenser and his son banished. This inspired Edward to act. In 1322 he recalled the Despensers from exile, and waged war against the barons on their behalf. Lancaster, defeated at Boroughbridge, was executed at Pontefract. For the next five years the Despensers ruled England. Unlike the ordainers, they took pains to get the Commons on their side, and a parliament held at York in 1322 revoked the ordinances because they encroached upon the rights of the crown. From this time no statute was technically valid unless the Commons had agreed to it. This marks the most important step forward in Edward II's reign. But the rule of the Despensers soon became corrupt. Their first thought was for themselves, and they stirred up universal indignation. In particular, they excited the ill-will of the queen, Isabella of France.<br />
 <br />
Deposition by Isabella of France<br />
Queen Isabella kept silence until 1325, when she went to France in company with her eldest son, Edward of Windsor, who was sent to do homage for Aquitaine to her brother, Charles IV of France. When her business was over, Isabella declined to return to her husband as long as the Despensers remained his favourites. She formed a liaison with Roger Mortimer of Wigmore, one of the baronial exiles, and in September 1326 landed in Essex accompanied by Mortimer and her son, declaring that she was come to avenge the murder of Lancaster, and to expel the Despensers. Edward's followers deserted him, and on October 2 he fled from London to the west, where he took refuge in the younger Despenser's estates in Glamorgan. His wife followed him, put to death both Despensers, and, after a futile effort to escape by sea, Edward was captured on November 6. According to legend, his capture took place at Pant-y-Brâd ("the dell of treachery"), near Llantrisant. He was imprisoned at Kenilworth Castle, and a parliament met at Westminster in January 1327, which chose his son to be king as Edward III. It was thought prudent to compel the captive king to resign the crown, and on January 20 Edward was forced to renounce his office before a committee of the estates.<br />
 <br />
Life in captivity and death<br />
The government of Isabella and Mortimer was so precarious that they dared not leave the deposed king alive. On April 3 he was secretly removed from Kenilworth and entrusted to the custody of two dependants of Mortimer. After various wanderings he was imprisoned at Berkeley Castle in Gloucestershire. Every anti-kingly indignity was inflicted upon him, and he was systematically ill-treated in the hope that he would die of disease. When his strong constitution seemed likely to prevail he was secretly put to death on October 11. According to Thomas de la Moore ca. 1327 AD:<br />
    "On the night of October 11 (1327 AD) while lying in on a bed (the king) was suddenly seized and, while a great mattress... weighed him down and suffocated him, a plumber's iron, heated intensely hot, was introduced through a tube into his secret parts so that it burned the inner portions beyond the intestines."<br />
 <br />
It was considered by his captors as an appropriate punishment for his homosexuality, and one which would show no outward signs of violence. It was announced that he had died a natural death, and he was buried in St Peter's Abbey at Gloucester, now the cathedral, where his son afterwards erected a magnificent tomb.<br />
 <br />
Following the king's death, the rule of Isabella and Mortimer did not last long. As soon as Edward III came of age, he executed Roger Mortimer, but spared his mother on condition that she leave the court. In 1330, Isabella retired from public life; she died, either at Hertford or at Castle Rising in Norfolk, on August 23, 1358.<br />

 <br />
Eleanor of Castile (1241 - 28 November 1290) was the first queen consort of Edward I of England. Eleanor was born in Castile, Spain, the daughter of Fernando III, King of Castile and Leon and his second wife, Jeanne, Countess of Ponthieu. Her given name was Leonor (she was called Eleanor in England). Her birthdate is not certainly known, but it is known that she was the second of the three children born to Fernando and Jeanne. Her elder brother Fernando was born 1239/40 and her younger brother Luis was born 1242/43. For the ceremonies in 1291 marking the first anniversary of Eleanor's death, 49 candlebearers appear, each candle commemorating one year of her life. This would place her birth in 1241.<br />
 <br />
She married Edward, the son of Henry III of England, in October 1254 at Burgos and became queen in 1272 when his father died and he became king. Theirs was one of the most successful royal marriages of all time, and she often accompanied her husband on his military campaigns, giving birth to his fourth son (later King Edward II of England) at Caernarfon in 1284, immediately after the conquest of Wales. She gave birth to fifteen children all told, six of whom survived into adulthood, but only four of whom outlived their parents.<br />
 <br />
Eleanor is remembered warmly by history as the queen who inspired the Eleanor crosses, but she was not so loved in her own time. Her English subjects considered her to be too foreign and greedy. Walter of Guisborough preserves the following poem:<br />
 <br />
    "The king desires to get our gold/the queen, our manors fair to hold..."<br />
 <br />
She and Edward seemed to have been more devoted to one another than to their offspring. Their daughter Joan was left to be raised by her grandmother in Ponthieu for much of her childhood. When their son Henry lay dying at Guildford, neither of his royal parents undertook the short journey from London to see him.<br />
 <br />
Eleanor died on November 28, 1290, at Nottingham (believed actually Harby, Nottinghamshire rather than the city), and her body was returned to London for burial at Westminster Abbey. Such was Edward's devotion to her that he erected memorial crosses at each overnight stop. Three of these "Eleanor crosses" are still landmarks today, although the most famous at Charing Cross (from which its name derives) is a copy. He did not remarry for nine years, to Marguerite of France, in 1299.<br />
 <br />
The locations of the 12 crosses were as follows: Lincoln, Grantham, Stamford, Geddington, Northampton, Stony Stratford, Woburn, Dunstable, St Albans, Waltham, Westcheap, and Charing.<br />

From Wikipedia<br />
 <br />
Isabella of France (c.1295 - August 22, 1358), known as the She-Wolf of France, was the Queen consort of Edward II of England.<br />
 <br />
Isabella was born in Paris in somewhere between 1288 an 1296, the daughter of King Philip IV of France and Queen Jeanne of Navarre, and the sister of three French kings. When she was only a infant, her father arranged a marriage between Isabella and Edward, the son and heir of Edward I of England. The marriage had been under negotiation for several years. Its political intent was to settle the conflicts between the two kingdoms which had arisen over the English continental possessions, namely Gascony but also English claims to Anjou and Normandy as well as larger areas of Aquitaine. Pope Boniface VIII had urged the marriage as early as 1298. In the intervening years there had been a great deal of wrangling over the precise conditions of the marriage contract, and the English king attempted to break this engagement several times. Only after Edward I died in 1307 did the wedding go forward.<br />
 <br />
Her groom, the new King Edward II, looked the part of a Plantagenet king to perfection. He was tall and athletic, and wildly popular at the beginning of his reign. She married Edward at Boulogne-sur-Mer on January 25, 1308. He had ascended the throne the previous year, hence Isabella never was titled only as Princess of Wales, as was wrongly portrayed in the film Braveheart.<br />
 <br />
At the time of her marriage Isabella was about twelve, described by Geoffrey of Paris as "the beauty of beauties...in the kingdom if not in all Europe." This may not merely have been a chronicler's politeness, as Isabella's father and brother were likewise very handsome men. Despite her youth and beauty, King Edward paid little attention to his bride, bestowing her wedding gifts upon his favorite, Piers Gaveston.<br />
 <br />
Despite Edward's homosexuality (perhaps bisexuality), he and Isabella produced four children, and she suffered at least one miscarriage. The itineraries of Edward II and Queen Isabella also show that they were together 9 months prior to the births of all four surviving offspring. Their children were:<br />
   1. Edward, born 1312<br />
   2. John, born 1316<br />
   3. Eleanor, born 1318, married Reinoud II of Guelders<br />
   4. Joan, born 1321, married David II of Scotland<br />
 <br />
Although Isabella produced four children, the king was popularly believed to be homosexual, and lavished his attention on a succession of male favourites, including Piers Gaveston and Hugh le Despenser the younger. He neglected Isabella, once even abandoning her in a dangerous situation in Scotland, at Tynemouth. She barely escaped Robert the Bruce's army, fleeing along the coast to English soil. Isabella despised his favorite, Hugh the younger Despenser, and in 1321, while pregnant with her youngest child, she dramatically begged Edward to banish Despenser from the kingdom. Despenser was exiled, but Edward recalled him later that year, and this act seems to have finally turned Isabella against him all-together. She may have helped Roger Mortimer escape from the Tower of London in 1323.<br />
 <br />
When her brother, King Charles IV of France, seized Edward's French possessions in 1325, she returned to France and gathered an army to oppose Edward, in alliance with Roger Mortimer, 1st Earl of March, who had become her lover. Enraged by this, Edward demanded that Isabella return to England. Her brother, King Charles, replied, "The queen has come of her own will and may freely return if she wishes. But if she prefers to remain here, she is my sister and I refuse to expel her."<br />
 <br />
Isabella and Mortimer left the French court in summer 1326 and went to William III, Count of Hainaut and Holland, who's wife was Isabella's cousin. He provided them with eight men-of-war in return for a marriage contract between his daughter Philippa and Isabella's son, Edward. On September 21, 1326 Isabella and Mortimer landed at Suffolk with their mercenary army. King Edward offered a reward for their deaths, and even carried a knife in his hose with which to kill his wife, and said that if he had no other weapon he would crush her with his teeth.<br />
 <br />
King Edward's few allies deserted him; the Despensers were killed, and Edward himself was captured and abdicated in favour of his eldest son, Edward III of England. Since the young king was only fourteen when he was crowned on January 25, 1327, Isabella and Mortimer ruled as regents in his place.<br />
 <br />
Isabella and Mortimer famously plotted to murder the deposed king in such a way as not to draw blame on themselves, sending the famous order "Edwardum occidere nolite timere bonum est" which depending on where the comma was inserted could mean either "Fear not the killing Edward, it is good" or "No killing of Edward, it is good to fear".<br />
 <br />
When Edward III attained his majority, he remembered their disloyalty, and had both Isabella and Mortimer taken prisoner, despite Isabella's cries of "Fair son, have pity on gentle Mortimer". Mortimer was executed for treason, but Isabella's life was spared and she was allowed to retire to Castle Rising in Norfolk. She did not, as legend would have it, go insane; she enjoyed a comfortable retirement and made many visits to her son's court, doting on her grandchildren. Isabella took the habit of the Poor Clares before she died on August 22, 1358, and her body was returned to London for burial at the Franciscan church at Newgate. She was buried in her wedding dress, with Edward's heart interred with her.<br />

Eustace II, (d. 1093), count of Boulogne, was the husband of Goda,daughter of the English king Æthelred the Unready, and sister of Edwardthe Confessor. He was the son of Eustace I. From his second marriage withIda of Lorraine, Eustace had two sons, Godfrey of Bouillon and Baldwin,later monarchs of Jerusalem in Syria.<br />
 <br />
Eustace paid a visit to England in 1051, and was honourably received at the Confessor's court. A brawl in which he and his servants became involved with the citizens of Dover led to a serious quarrel between the king and Earl Godwine.<br />
 <br />
The latter, to whose jurisdiction the men of Dover were subject, refused to punish them. His lack of respect to those in authority was made the excuse for outlawing himself and his family. In 1066 Eustace came to England with Duke William, and fought at the battle of Hastings.<br />
 <br />
In the following year, probably because he was dissatisfied with his share of the spoil, he assisted the Kentishmen in an attempt to seize Dover Castle. The conspiracy failed, and Eustace was sentenced to forfeit his English fiefs.<br />
 <br />
Subsequently he was reconciled to the Conqueror, who restored a portion of the confiscated lands.<br />
 <br />
Eustace died in 1093, and was succeeded by his son, Eustace III.<br />

Eustace III, was a count of Boulogne, successor to his father CountEustace II of Boulogne. It remains somewhat unclear whether he was also ason of Ida of Lorraine, who certainly was the mother of his two youngerbrothers.<br />
 <br />
He went on crusade in 1096 with his brothers Godfrey of Bouillon (duke of Lower Lorraine) and Baldwin of Boulogne. He soon returned to Europe to administer his domains. He married Princess Mary of Scotland, daughter of King Malcolm III of Scotland, and Saint Margaret of Scotland. Eustace and Mary had one daughter, Matilda of Boulogne.<br />
 <br />
When his youngest brother king Baldwin I of Jerusalem died in 1118, the elderly Eustace was offered the throne. Eustace was at first uninterested, but was convinced to accept it; he travelled all the way to Apulia before learning that a distant relative, Baldwin of Bourcq, had been crowned in the meantime. Eustace returned to Boulogne and died about 1125.<br />
 <br />
On his death the county of Boulogne was inherited by his daughter, Matilda, and her husband Stephen de Blois, count of Mortain, afterwards king of England, and at the death of Matilda in 1151 it was inherited by their son, Eustace IV of Boulogne, later their second son William and ultimately by their daughter Marie of Boulogne, since both sons died without children.<br />

From Wikipedia<br />
 <br />
Maelgwn ap Cadwallon (c.480-c.547, reigned from 520s?) (Latin: Maglocunus; English: Malcolm), also known as Maelgwn Gwynedd and Maelgwn Hir ('the Tall'), was king of Gwynedd, and a character from Celtic mythology.<br />
 <br />
The historical Maelgwn was one of the most influential rulers of 6th century Britain, and has become one of the most famous (or infamous) leaders in Welsh history. The Christian writer Gildas (who referred to him Malgocunus, meaning 'Great Hound') attacked him in De Excidio Britanniae as 'first in evil,' one of the most vicious tyrants in British history, and accused him of having murdered his uncle while still a youth. Geoffrey of Monmouth (calling him Malgo) specifically noted his handsome features, but also claimed that he was homosexual. Other notable misdeeds said to have been performed by Maelgwn include murdering his first wife and his nephew in order to clam his nephew's wife as his own. Maelgwn remained rather unpopular with leading church writers, despite several attempts at patronage, including founding the bishopric of Bangor.<br />
 <br />
He was also said to be a great patron of the arts and a skilled lawgiver, although some attribute this reputation to Maelgwn's own propaganda. He established court at Deganwy, and surrounded himself with an entourage of bards and artisans who wrote glowingly of his achievements. By the time of his death, Maelgwn had established himself as the preeminent ruler of the region, and his sons Rhun and Brude would inherit control over both Gwynedd and the lands of the Picts in southern Britain.<br />
 <br />
Elias Gruffydd preserved the following mythological tradition in a manuscript he wrote in the mid-16th century, although some critics believe this story is much older.<br />
 <br />
    King Maelgwn demanded that a distant son of one of his lords, Elphin, praise him and his court. Elphin refused, claiming his bard, Taliesin was a better bard and his wife a prettier woman than anyone the King had in his court. Taliesin knew what was happening, because he was a seer, and told Elphin's wife. Maelgwn's son Rhun went to Elphin's house to seduce his wife and prove Elphin's claims weren't true. Rhun got her drunk. When she passed out, Rhun tried to take her wedding ring off to prove her unfaithfulness; since the ring wouldn't come off, he cut off her finger. When King Maelgwn attempted to show the finger to Elphin, he pointed out that his wife cut her fingernails more often than the owner of the finger, had servants to kneed dough and never had any under her nails, and her ring was loose on her finger, and that one was tight.<br />
 <br />
    Maelgwn demanded Taliesin come to his court to prove the other claim wrong. Taliesin gave twenty minutes for both himself and the King's bards to come up with an epic. The royal bards couldn't do it. When it came Taliesin's time, he caused a massive wind to rattle the castle. Frightened, Maelgwn sent for Elphin. Taliesin's next song caused Elphin's chains to detach. Maelgwn challenged the pair to a horse race. Taleisin arrived the next day with an old, weak horse. As each of the king's horses passed him at the very start of the race, Taliesin touched its rump with a twig of holly. When they had all passed, he dropped his hat to the ground. When the king's horses came back, right before the finish line, they stopped at the holly twigs Taliesin had laid there, and began to dance. Taliesin's old horse strolled back in quite a bit later and won the race.<br />
 <br />
The 1911 Britannica has this tale to tell of him...<br />
    The first Eisteddfod of which any account seems to have descended to us was one held on the banks of the Conway in the 6th century, under the auspices of Maelgwn Gwynedd, prince of North Wales. Maelgwn on this occasion, in order to prove the superiority of vocal song over instrumental music, is recorded to have offered a reward to such bards and minstrels as should swim over the Conway. There were several competitors, but on their arrival on the opposite shore the harpers found themselves unable to play owing to the injury their harps had sustained from the water, while the bards were in as good tune as ever.<br />
 <br />
Maelgwn 'the Dragon of the Isle' was also a main character in the two trilogies ('The Ancient Future' trilogy and 'The Celestial Triad') written by Australian author Traci Harding. In the books, Maelgwn is portrayed as a fair, kind and loving man, whose childhood tutor was Taliesin. His father Caswallon was imprisoned by his uncle Cadfer, who then raped his mother Sorcha Lawhir (she killed herself rather than live with the consequences of the rape). Maelgwn killed his uncle eventually, and gave the throne back to his father.<br />

Ascending to the throne of what was then the most powerful kingdom of Britain in his twenties upon the death of his father, Maelgwn Hir ap Cadwallon, from plague, Rhun soon found himself embroiled in a dynastic dispute with Elidyr Llydanwyn, king of Rheged. Elidyr had married Rhun's sister, and as a result believed himself to be the proper heir to the throne of Gwynedd. Elidyr's attempted invasion of Gwynedd, proved unsuccessful, and Elidyr himself was killed in the attempt. Elidyr's cousins, however, Rhydderch Hen of Strathclyde, and Clydno Eiten of Lothian, remained bitter rivals of Rhun, and of his half-brother, Brude, leader of the Picts to the south. Rhydderch and Clydno, aided by Elidyr's brother Cinmarc, raided and sacked the town of Arfon (now Caernarfon) in Anglesey.<br />
 <br />
Raising an army from all over northern Wales, Rhun retaliated, marching unopposed through Rheged and across the Pennines to York, effectively seizing control of all of north Wales and northern England and, through alliance with Brude, even stretching south in the lands held by the Picts. Though his authority was recognized by all, Rhun lacked the resources to maintain administrative control over such a large area, and eventually made peace with Peredur of York and returned to Gwynedd, probably towards the mid-560s. Rhun reigned for another two decades, but little else is heard of him.<br />

Early in the 12th Century, Stanton was given by Henry I to his secondwife, Queen Adeliza (or Adela). A large part of it she presented to akinswomen, Millicent de Camville. From the latter it was inherited in1191 by Isabel de Camville, and thus passed to her husband RicharddeHarcourt, from whom it has come down through the Harcourt family to thepresent day and from which circumstance the Manor and the village itselfbecame known as Stanton Harcourt. Queen Adeliza also gave land at Stantonto Reading Abbey, which remained patron of the parish church fill theDissolution of the Monasteries. A close relationship with St MichaelsChurch has been maintained by the Harcourts, and it contains the chapelunder which members of the family have been buried since the 15th century.<br />

Cadwallon ap Einion (c.460-534; reigned from c.500), also known asCadwallon Lawhir ('Long Hand'), was a king of Gwynedd.<br />
 <br />
According to tradition, Cadwallon ruled during, or shortly after, the Battle of Mons Badonicus, and King Arthur's victory over the Saxons (depending on which date you believe, said battle accorded either sometime between the early 490s and the mid 510s). Although it is unlikely that Cadwallon himself was present at the event, he would likely have benefitted from the period of relative peace and prosperity throughout Britain that it augured. The most momentous military achievement of Cadwallon's reign was the final expulsion of Irish settlers on Ynys Mon (Anglesey), and the absorption of that island, which would later become the cultural and political base of the kingdom, into Gwynedd.<br />
 <br />
Cadwallon's second name, Lawhir, referred to an actual physical characteristic of the man: he apparently had unusually long arms. Iolo Goch claims that he could "reach a stone from the ground to kill a raven, without bending his back, because his arm was as long as his side to the ground."<br />
 <br />
According to Gildas, Cadwallon's son, Maelgwn, murdered his uncle to ascend to the throne, which suggests that someone other than Maelgwn himself inherited the kingdom upon Cadwallon's death. No clear evidence exists as to who this "lost king" might be (assuming, of course, that Gildas's account is reliable), but some have suggested the name of Owain Danwyn ('White-Tooth') as the unfortunate heir/victim.<br />

Ferdinand II, king of Leon (d. 1188), was the son of Alfonso VII and ofBerenguela, of the house of the counts of Barcelona. On the division ofthe kingdoms which had obeyed his father, he received León. His reign ofthirty years was one of strife marked by no signal success or reverse. Hehad to contend with his unruly nobles, several of whom he put to death.During the minority of his nephew Alfonso VIII. of Castile he endeavouredto impose himself on the kingdom as regent. On the west he was in more orless constant strife with Portugal, which was in process of becoming anindependent kingdom. His relations to the Portuguese house must havesuffered by his repudiation of his wife Urraca, daughter of Alphonso I ofPortugal. Though he took the king of Portugal prisoner in 1180, he madeno political use of his success. He extended his dominions southward inExtremadura at the expense of the Moors. Ferdinand, who died in 1188,left the reputation of a good knight and hard fighter, but did notdisplay political or organizing faculty.<br />

Iago ap Beli (c. 560-613; reigned from c. 599) (Latin: Iacobus; English: James) was King of Gwynedd.<br />
 <br />
The most notable feature of his reign (of which little information exists) is the growing strength of the nearby kingdoms of Mercia, under the rule of Pybba and his son Penda, and of Bernicia/Northumbria, under Æthelfrith. Some evidence exists to suggest that Iago may have entered into some sort of alliance with Pybba, trading the latter's promise not to attack Gwynedd in exchange for Gwynedd's support against Northumbria, should that support be needed. In 604, after being driven from his throne by Æthelfrith, Edwin, king of Deira, sought refuge at the Iago's court. As a result, Æthelfrith turned his wrath against Gwynedd, slaughtering the monks at a monastery at Bangor, and finally facing the forces of Gwynedd and Powys at the Battle of Caer-Legion (Chester) in 613.<br />
 <br />
It is not known whether or not Iago took part in this battle: he may have done so, perishing amidst the slaughter, or he may have already abdicated his throne in favor of his son, Cadfan, and died later than year in a monastery.<br />

The O'Briens, one of the few native Irish families with a p eerage,descend in the male line from Brian Boroimhe, Princ e of Thomond (NorthMunster or the north part of southwes t Ireland, roughly commensuratewith an area centered on mo dern Co. Clare) and Chief of the Dalgais, whobecame High K ing of Ireland 1002 and was killed at the victory over th eDanes of Clontarf 23 April 1014.  [Burke's' Peerage, p. 1 495]<br />
 <br />
From Wikipedia   -  Brian Boru<br />
 <br />
Brian Bóruma mac Cennétig, known as Brian Boru born probably 941 (near Killaloe in modern County Clare). He was the High King of Ireland from 1002, until he was killed in 1014 after the Battle of Clontarf. He is credited with being a unifying leader who brought the Irish nation together to drive the occupying Viking Danes out of the country.<br />
 <br />
His father was Cennétig mac Lorcáin, King of Thomond who died in 957 and his mother was Bé Binn ingen Aurchada, daughter of the King of West Connacht.<br />
 <br />
His brother Mathgamain suceeded to the leadership of Thomond, and when he died in 976, Brian replaced him, eventually becoming the King of Munster and later High King of Ireland from 1002. He was killed by a lone assassin on Good Friday April 23, 1014 during the Battle of Clontarf against the Norsemen of Dublin. Brian was buried at Ard Macha (Armagh).<br />
 <br />
The origin of his cognomen Boru or Boruma (Tributes) is believed to relate to a crossing point on the river Shannon where a cattle tribute was driven from his sept, the Dal Cais to the traditional larger sept, the Éoganacht. Later legends originated to suggest that is was because he collected monies from the minor rulers of Ireland and used these to rebuild monasteries and libraries that had been destroyed during Norsemen (Viking) invasions.<br />
 <br />
The family descended from him (the O'Briens) subsequently ranked as one of the chief dynastic families of the country (see Chiefs of the Name).<br />
 <br />
Brian was married four times:<br />
    * First to Mór. She was the mother of Murchad, who was slain with Brian at Clontarf.<br />
    * Secondly to Echrad. She was mother of his successor Tadc.<br />
    * Thirdly to Gormflaith. She is the best known of his wives. She was the daughter of Murchad MacFinn, King of Leinster and also widow of Olaf Cuaran, the Viking king of Dublin and York. She was the mother of Donnchad, who succeeded Brian as King of Munster.<br />
    * Fourthly to Dub Choblaig. She was daughter of the King of Connacht.<br />
 <br />
In the 12th century his O'Brien descendents commissioned a dynastic propaganda tract known as Cogadh Gaedhil re Gallaibh (the War of the Irish with the Foreigners) in which he takes the leading role. Uncritical reading of this tract in the past has given rise to the inflated position he holds in the popular imagination.<br />

Mrs. G. B. [Adaline] Carson died at the home of her daughter, Mrs. J[ames] L. Raines, in Perry, at 3:50 o'clock Tuesday morning, death being due to Bright's disease. She had been ill about two months, being confined to the bed most of the time. Mrs. Carson was 72 years of age, and after a long, busy and useful life she died as she had lived--honored, trusted and loved. Two daughters, Mrs. J. L. [Fannie] Raines and Miss Mary Carson, of Perry, and a son, Geo. Carson, of Kansas City, were present when the end came. Funeral services were held at the home at 10 o'clock this morning and largely attended. The Rev. D. A. Shutt conducted the services. Interment was made in Oak Ridge cemetery.<br />

Obituary<br />
Jane Adaline Cole was born near Albany, N.Y., Sept. 10, 1836. She died July 6, 1909, aged 72 years, 10 months, 4 days.<br />
In early childhood she, with a younger sister, was left orphans. They were given a good home by a kind family, with whom she lived until the age of 18, when she was married to G.B. Carson of Knoxville, Mo. In 1858 she, with her husband and two children, moved to Oskaloosa, Kan., making their home there until 1865, when they moved to Perry, Kan., and in 1875 to Joplin, Mo. A few years after the death of her husband, which occurred in 1891, she came back to Perry, where she has since made her home with her daughter, Mrs. J. L. Raines. She passed over the River on the morning of July 6, at 4 o'clock.<br />
Her Christian fortitude and patience in bearing her last affliction was sublime, her principle being to save others trouble and care. She was a model of unselfish devotion to her children, four of whom survive here, three having preceded her to the other shore.<br />
She united with the Cumberland Presbyterian church, remaining a faithful member till her death. Her well-worn and marked Bible is a silent testimony of her devotion to her God. Of a very retiring disposition, she was never heard to censure others' shortcomings, but rather to excuse and uplift.<br />
Gentle, patient mother, yours was a triumphant entrance to the "Glory Land," but you have left sad hearts to battle with life on this side; yet yours is the better part and we should not repine, but try to emulate your sweet example.<br />
The service was conducted by Rev. Shutt at the home Thursday at 10 a.m., and the beautiful thoughts conveyed by him were an inspiration and comfort.<br />
The dear body was laid to rest amid beautiful flowers in the Oak Ridge cemetery.<br />
Her sister, Miss Lizzie Irick, and those of her children, Mrs. J.L. Raines, Geo. B. Carson and Mary Carson, were present at the last.<br />
Card of Thanks<br />
May heaven's choicest blessings rest upon the kind friends and neighbors who so unselfishly assisted us, and for their sympathy in the loss of our dear mother.<br />
Mr. J.L. Raines, Geo. B. Carson & Mary Carson<br />

Alfonso IX of León (August 15, 1171 - September 23 or 24, 1230; ruled from 1188-1230), first cousin of Alfonso VIII of Castile, and numbered next to him as being a junior member of the family, is said by Ibn Khaldun to have been called the Baboso or "Slobberer", because he was subject to fits of rage during which he foamed at the mouth.<br />
 <br />
Alfonso was the only son of King Ferdinand II of Leon and Urraca of Portugal. Though he took a part in the work of the reconquest, this king is chiefly remembered by the difficulties into which his successive marriages led him with the pope. He was first married in 1191 to his cousin Teresa of Portugal, who bore him two daughters, and a son who died young.<br />
 <br />
The marriage was declared null by the pope, to whom Alfonso paid no attention till he was presumably tired of his wife. It cannot have been his conscience which constrained him to leave Teresa, for his next step was to marry Berenguela of Castile in 1197, who was his second cousin. For this act of contumacy the king and kingdom were placed under interdict.<br />
 <br />
The pope was, however, compelled to modify his measures by the threat that if the people could not obtain the services of religion they would not support the clergy, and that heresy would spread. The king was left under interdict personally, but to that he showed himself indifferent, and he had the support of his clergy. Berenguela left him after the birth of five children, and the king then returned to Teresa, to whose daughters he left his kingdom by will.<br />
 <br />
Alfonso's children by Teresa of Portugal were:<br />
   1. Sancha (c. 1192-1270)<br />
   2. Dulce, also called Aldonza (c. 1195-c.1243)<br />
   3. Fernando (1204-August 1214)<br />
 <br />
His eldest daughter, Sancha, was engaged to her cousin King Henry I of Castile, but Henry died in 1217 before the marriage could be solemnized. Wanting to disinherit his eldest son, Fernando, King Alfonso invited John of Brienne to marry his daughter Sancha and thusly inherit the Leonese throne. However, Queen Berenguela convinced John of Brienne to marry one of her daughters instead. Though she was the nominal heiress on her father's death in 1230, Sancha was easily set aside by Berenguela and Fernando. Sancha became a nun at Cozollos, where she died in 1270; she was later beatified. Her sister Dulce-Aldonza spent her life with their mother in Portugal.<br />
 <br />
Alfonso's children by Berenguela of Castile were:<br />
   1. Leonor (1198/99-October 31, 1210)<br />
   2. King Fernando III (1200-<br />
   3. Berenguela (1201-1237), married John of Brienne<br />
   4. Alfonso, Lord of Molina (1203-1272)<br />
   5. Constanza (1205-September 7, 1242), became a nun at Las Huelgas<br />

Daily Hampshire Gazette, Northampton, 1 February 2011<br />

NORTHAMPTON - As a Northampton District Court judge of 25 years, Alvertus Jackson Morse used a common-sense approach in the administration of justice and was remembered here in legal circles as a kind and decent man who brought an old-school, fatherly quality to the bench.<br />
Morse, a Northampton native who also served seven years handling care and protection cases in Franklin County Juvenile Court at the end of his career, died Sunday at his Pelham home. He was 80.<br />
"He's noteworthy in terms of how he went about the business of judging," said Judge W. Michael Goggins, acting presiding judge of Northampton District Court. "He was incredibly patient and also incredibly, genuinely inquisitive about each matter that came before him. The result of that was generally whatever the matter was before him, when it was over, everybody felt that they were well heard. He had a Ward Cleaver quality to him."<br />
Morse, a Republican, whose grandfather Alvertus Jason Morse was mayor of Northampton from 1916-19, was the third generation of his family to practice law in the city, said his son, Richard Morse, of Amherst.<br />
Jack Morse graduated from Amherst College in 1951 and from Cornell Law School in 1954, and served in the Army from 1954-56 before returning to Northampton to practice law with his father, Alvertus Davis Morse. He served two terms on the Northampton City Council and ran unsuccessfully for mayor in 1963.<br />
His ascent in the halls of justice came in 1973 when, after years of closing real estate deals, drafting wills and researching land records with his family law practice, Morse was tapped by former Gov. Francis W. Sargent as a special justice.<br />
Among those who put in a good word for Morse and urged him to apply for the post at the time was Democrat John M. Callahan, Northwestern district attorney from 1971-78, who was well-connected in local political circles.<br />
"Jack was a guy who I respected immensely," Callahan said. "He was made for the district court because he was intelligent and fair and kind to people and he had a respect for the administration of justice. He did it with decency and kindness. He understood the business that was in front of him.<br />
Morse had little to no criminal trial court experience when he was appointed, but he nevertheless would develop into an outspoken and compassionate justice, say attorneys who appeared before him over the years. After six years as a special justice, Morse was named presiding judge in Northampton District Court in 1978 and served until 1997.<br />
"He always tried to do the right thing, which is what you want from a district court judge." said Northampton attorney Stella Xanthakos, who appeared before Morse as both a prosecutor and defense attorney over the course of a decade. "He had a lot of personality. He had a very big heart."<br />
Morse's common-sense approach and respect for the law shone through in one notable case that involved a woman who sprayed glue on pornographic magazines at an Amherst newsstand. Morse had ordered the woman to pay restitution to the newsstand whose magazines she ruined because, as he put it, "it's still legal to sell this garbage." But he also took the district attorney's office to task for lodging a felony charge of malicious destruction of property over $250 against the woman, which carries with it the potential for jail time, instead of a misdemeanor charge. The glue involved, Elmer's in this case, apparently tarnished a book case harboring the magazines.<br />
"He made some comment about having used Elmer's glue for years and years and that one could just wash it off with soap and water," Xanthakos recalled. "He used common sense and that's what he was known for."<br />
Morse was respected by area lawyers who observed him in closed-door care and protection hearings involving parents suspected of abusing or neglecting their children, involuntary commitment hearings for former state hospital patients who sought to be released against the will of hospital officials, and hearings for patients who do not want medication when hospital psychiatrists say it is necessary.<br />
"He cared about the outcome a lot ... when a lot of people weren't caring about these cases in those days," said Northampton attorney Thomas Lesser. "He cared a lot about young people, a lot about what happened to young people."<br />
Shortly after leaving Northampton District Court, Morse was called back to handle care and protection cases in Franklin County Juvenile Court, which he did for seven years.<br />
"Those are emotional and protracted cases," Goggins said. "Not a lot of guys would have done that. That was hard, hard work."<br />
In a Gazette interview in 1989, more than a decade after being named presiding district court judge, Morse said he never let his position of authority get to his head, or as he put it, "a feeling that I'm some kind of God Almighty."<br />
"That's something that I always resented," he said. "When judges put on their robes and forget they are lawyers. Sometimes they forget they are a member of the human race."<br />
Funeral plans were incomplete Monday. Czelusniak Funeral Home is in charge of arrangements.<br />

From Wikipedia<br />
 <br />
Afonso I of Portugal, more commonly known as Afonso Henriques, or also Alfonso, Alphonso or Alphonsus, (Guimarães, 1109, traditionally July 25 - Coimbra, 1185 December 6), also known as the Conqueror ( Port. o Conquistador), was the first king of Portugal, declaring his independence from Leon-Castile, a deed often identifying the Condado Portucalense as the first nation-based state of Europe (however Portuguese of that era were close kin to other tribes of Castile-Leon, their speech differing only at the level of dialect, not being separate languages - Portugal became a separate nation and people mostly due to its independence). Alfonso was the son of Henry, Count of Portugal and Teresa of Leon, the illegitimate daughter of Alfonso VI of Castile. He was proclaimed king in July 26, 1139 and died on December 6, 1185 in Coimbra.<br />
 <br />
At the end of the 11th century, the Iberian Peninsula political agenda was mostly concerned with the Reconquista, the driving out of the Muslim successor-states to the Caliphate of Córdoba after its collapse. With European military aristocracies focused on the Crusades, Alfonso VI of Castile called for the help of the French nobility to deal with the Moors. In exchange, he was to give the hands of his daughters in wedlock to the leaders of the expedition and bestow royal privileges to the others. Thus, the royal heiress Urraca of Castile wedded Raymond, younger son of the Count of Burgundy, and her half-sister, princess Teresa of Leon, wedded his distant kinsman, another French crusader, Henry of Burgundy, younger brother of the Duke of Burgundy whose mother was daughter of Count of Barcelona. Henry was made Count of Portugal, a burdensome earldom in the south of Castile, where Moorish incursions and attacks were to be expected. With his wife Teresa as co-ruler of Portugal, Henry stood the ordeal and held the lands for his father-in-law.<br />
 <br />
From this wedlock several sons were born, but only one, Afonso Henriques (meaning "Afonso son of Henry") thrived. The boy followed his father as Count of Portugal in 1112, under the tutelage of his mother. The relations between Teresa and her son Afonso proved difficult. Only eleven years old, Afonso had already his own political ideas, greatly different from his mother's. In 1120, the young prince took the side of the archbishop of Braga, a political foe of Teresa, and both were exiled by her orders. Afonso spent the next years away from his own county, under the watch of the bishop. In 1123 Afonso became fourteen, the adult age in the 12th century. He made himself a knight on his own account in the cathedral of Zamora, raised an army, and proceeded to take control of his lands. Near Guimarães he overcame the troops under his mother's lover and ally Count Fernão Peres de Trava of Galicia, making her his prisoner and exiling her forever to a monastery in León. Thus the possibility of incorporating Portugal into a kingdom of Galicia was eliminated. He also vanquished Alfonso VII of Castile, another of his mother's allies, and thus freed the county from political dependence on the crown of León and Castile. He had already a dangerously independent mind. On April 6, 1129, Afonso Henriques dictated the writ in which he proclaims himself King of Portugal.<br />
 <br />
Afonso then turned his arms against the everlasting problem of the Moors in the south. His campaigns were successful and, on July 26, 1139, he obtained an overwhelming victory in the Battle of Ourique, and straight after was unanimously proclaimed king by his soldiers. This meant that Portugal was no longer a vassal county of Castile, but an independent kingdom in its own right. Next, he assembled the first assembly of the estates-general at Lamego, where he was given the crown from the bishop of Bragança, to confirm the independence.<br />
 <br />
Independence, however, was not a thing a land could choose on its own. Portugal had still to be acknowledged by the neighbouring lands and, most important, by the Catholic church and the pope. Afonso wedded Mafalda, daughter of Count Amadeo III of Savoy, and sent ambassadors to Rome to negotiate with the pope. In Portugal, he built several monasteries and convents and bestowed important privileges to religious orders. In 1143, he wrote to Pope Innocent II to declare himself and the kingdom servants of the Church, swearing to pursue driving the Moors out of the Iberian peninsula. Bypassing any king of Castile, Afonso declared himself the direct liegeman of the Papacy. Thus, Afonso continued to distinguish himself by his exploits against the Moors, from whom he wrested Santarém in 1146 and Lisbon in 1147 (see Siege of Lisbon). He also conquered an important part of the land south of the Tagus River, although this was lost again to the Moors in the following years.<br />
 <br />
Meanwhile, King Alfonso VII of Castile (Afonso's cousin) regarded the independent ruler of Portugal as nothing but a rebel. Conflict between the two was constant and bitter in the following years. Afonso became involved in a war, taking the sides of the Aragonese king, an enemy of Castile. To ensure the alliance, his son Sancho was engaged to Dulce Berenguer, sister of the Count of Barcelona, and princess of Aragon. Finally, probably in 1143, the Treaty of Zamora established peace between the cousins and the recognition by the Kingdom of Castile and Leon that Portugal was an independent Kingdom.<br />
 <br />
In 1167, Afonso was disabled in an engagement near Badajoz by a fall from his horse, and made prisoner by the soldiers of the king of Leon. Portugal was obliged to surrender as his ransom almost all the conquests Afonso had made in Galicia in the previous years.<br />
 <br />
In 1179 the privileges and favours given to the Catholic Church were compensated. In a papal bull, Pope Alexander III acknowledged Afonso as king and Portugal as an independent land with the right to conquer lands from the Moors. With this papal blessing, Portugal was at last secured as a country and safe from any Castilian attempts of annexation.<br />
 <br />
In 1184, in spite of his great age, he had still sufficient energy to relieve his son Sancho, who was besieged in Santarém by the Moors. He died shortly after, in 1185.<br />
 <br />
The Portuguese revere him as a hero, both on account of his personal character and as the founder of their kingdom.<br />

LONG BEACH - Tedd Thomey, the restaurant critic known for producinglively food columns for the Press-Telegram for 40 years, died Monday. Hewas 88.<br />
Thomey, a native of Butte, Mont., was born on July 19, 1920. He began his journalism career at San Diego State University. He later made his way to the UC Berkeley and graduated with a journalism degree.<br />
While in college, Thomey enlisted in the Marine Corps. During his stint in World War II, he went on to serve at Iwo Jima, where he was injured in battle before the flag-raising at Mount Suribachi. After the war, Thomey traded in his gun for a pen and began a writing career at the San Francisco Chronicle.<br />
He came to Long Beach in 1948 and began working as a reporter for the Long Beach Independent in 1950 - now the Press-Telegram.<br />
For years, it was his two restaurant columns "Stepping Out" and "In Person" that dominated a large section of the paper. "Stepping Out" went on to become a weekly magazine that ran every Thursday.<br />
Pat Thomey, Tedd's wife of 65 years, recalled her husband writing up to 5,000 words for the Press-Telegram on a weekly basis. He retired in 1990.<br />
"Writing was always his first love," she said.<br />
During his career, Thomey also penned 18 books, including "The Big Love," which became a Broadway play in 1991.<br />
In his columns, Thomey included many personal anecdotes about his family, including his daughter, Jill Ford, known to readers as Thomey's "rinky-dink daughter." Ford said she always took pride in her father's term of endearment for her.<br />
Her fondest memories will be of watching her father at work, she said.<br />
"I remember being so proud of going to restaurants with him," said Ford, who often helped her father take photographs. "It was always a joy for me to see his special gifts."<br />
Thomey is survived by his wife and daughter.<br />

Elizabeth's surname has been given as Neil or Tilden/Tilton and inseveral cases, as Seldon. In the parish registers of Tenterden, NathanielTilden's children are given, and there is no Elizabeth. Further, theWilliam Bassett who arrived from Leyden as a widower may not have beenthis particular William Bassett. Charles Banks states that given theprovisions of this William's will and his age at death in 1667, it seemsvery unlikely that the two Williams are one and the same. Years oferroneous attribution of Elizabeth as a daughter of either Nathaniel orThomas Tilden make the confusion murkier, not clearer, and it may not bepossible to sort out. What does appear to be true is that Ruth, daughterof William Bassett married John Sprague and their son married Lydia, LNU,and fathered Irene Sprague, who married, in Connecticut, Aaron Fish. Whatalso appears to be true is that a William Bassett arrived abt 1621, andin 1623 was given a share for himself and for his wife Elizabeth, sowhoever William was, he appears to have married shortly after hisarrival. It seems likely, given the times and hardships, that he may havemarried a widow, but there's evidently no firm evidence of Elizabeth'ssurname.<br />

Ancestry from Kenelm back has been researched but no agreement has been reached by scholars as to the correct ancestry. There seems to be real doubt that Catherine was the mother of Edward who married Magdalene Ollyver. "New Eng Hist & Gen Reg" V. 121 pg 25-29, an article by John G. Hunt, B.S.C. of Arlington, Va., discusses possible Winslow ancestry and says his mother "seems most surely to have been Elizabeth Morgan. Subsequent articles in V. 122 & 124 discusses the various opinions and argue that the strongest evidences favor Elizabeth Folliot<br />

THOMAS TUPPER, son of Henry Tupper and grandson of Richard Tupper of co.Sussex, England, was born in Bury, co. Sussex, 28 Jan. 1578. As a ship'scarpenter and member of the crew, he is believed to have voyaged toAmerica first about 1621, again in 1624, when he remained a year, a thirdtime in 1631 when he stayed at Cape Ann for an uncertain period, finallycoming to Sandwich, Mass., in 1637 where he settled and remained untilhis death 28 March 1676. Thomas Tupper married first in the Parish ofChelmsford, co. Essex, 29 April 1622, Katharine Gator; secondly, inTopsfield, Mass., 25 Jan. 1628, Susan Turner, a widow, who died inTopsfield in 1634; and thirdly, in Ipswich, Mass., 21 Dec. 1634, AnneHodgson, a widow, of Topsfield, who was born about 1588 and died inSandwich 4 June 1676.<br />
Thomas Tupper who had come to Sandwich in 1637 with his daughter aged twelve and a two year old son, became an outstanding citizen of the community and developed exceptional ability. He served in the general court in 1644 and later was deputy for 20 years, from 1647 to 1667; he served on juries, local boards and commissions, was a charter member of the church and for three years from 1667 was selectman of the town. In his later years, when there was no settled minister, Mr. Tupper conducted religious services as a layman and he was deeply interested in religious work among the Indians. He was shrewd trader and invested heavily in real estate and held large holdings at his death.<br />

 <br />
Thomas, b. in Bury, Sussex County on 28 (7) January 1578. Birth date 27 January 1577/78 (16). As a ship's carpenter and member of the crew, he is believed to have voyaged to America first about 1621, again in 1624 when he remained a year, a third time in 1631 when he stayed at Cape Ann for an uncertain period, and finally to Sandwich, Mass. in 1637 where he settled and remained until his death 28 March 1676 (1678 according to (16)). This sequence is from (3) but it does not seem entirely correct: note that he married in January 1627/28 in MA and his wife died in Topsfield, MA in 1634. According to (2), about 1635 he emigrated to Massachusetts to obtain "liberty of conscience", denied to him under the reign of Charles I of England. This seems however like a bit of an embellishment since we know he first came to America as a hired tradesman.<br />
 <br />
Thomas Tupper married first in the Parish of Chelmsford, Essex, 29 April 1622, to Katharine Gator. They had two children, both born in England. It is not clear if his wife ever came to America. Secondly, he was married, in Topsfield, Mass., 25 January 1627/28, to Susan Turner, a widow. Thomas and Susan had two children, both born in England (1628 and 1633), so at least Susan must have returned to England. She must have later returned to the New World because she died in Topsfield in 1634. Thirdly, in Ipswich, Mass., 21 December 1634, Thomas married Anne Hodgson (Thomas would have been about 56). Anne was a widow, of Topsfield, born about 1588 (between 1588 and 1598 in (16) and written "Hodgeson") and who died in Sandwich 4 June 1676. They had one child. If the birthdates are correct, Anne would have been about 49 or 50 when she had her son Thomas; this seems a bit unlikely.<br />
 <br />
Thomas was one of the incorporators (2) of the town of Sandwich, MA and became an outstanding citizen of that town. He served in the general court in 1644 and later was deputy for 20 years, from 1647 to 1667; he served on juries, local boards and commissions, was a charter member of the church and for three years starting in 1667 was Selectman of the town (i.e., a member of a board of officers annually elected to manage various local concerns in a New England town). In his later years, when there was no settled minister, Mr. Tupper conducted religious services as a layman and he was deeply interested in religious work among the Indians. The source (2) adds that he cared especially for the Indians who were "living in spiritual darkness and savagery" and that he built the Indians a place of worship and established a congregation at Herring Pond. He was shrewd trader and invested heavily in real estate and held large holdings at his death.<br />
 <br />
 <br />
My information on the children of Thomas Tupper comes largely from (3) who provides good information on his original sources (which I repeat here). Thomas Tupper and his first wife Katharine [sic] Gator had two children in England:<br />
 <br />
1) Katherine Tupper, b. 31 January 1622/1623 in England. She married 19 October 1640 in Sandwich to Benjamin Nye, b. 4 May 1620 (4) at Biddenden, Kent, England, son of Thomas Nye and Agnes Rye. Benjamin had come to America on the Abigail in 1635 with the Freeman company. He first settled in Lynn, MA, but soon thereafter removed to Sandwich, MA. In (2), the ancestry of Benjamin is traced back a further 10 generations through England and back to the early 1300s in Denmark! Katherine died 4 June 1676 at Sandwich. Benjamin and Katherine had eight children:<br />
 <br />
Nathan Nye, b. after 1640, d. 1747 at Sandwich (sic from (2), but death date highly unlikely unless he was one of the last children). He was married to Mercy and they had 10 children (see (2) for details).<br />
Mary, b. after 1640, married 1 June 1670 to Jacob Burgess. No further information available.<br />
John, b. 29 June 1650. He m. Esther Shed. No further information available.<br />
Ebenezer, b. after 1640. He was m. 17 December 1675 (4) at Sandwich to Sarah Gibbs, daughter of Thomas Gibbs.<br />
Jonathan, b. 29 November 1649, m. Patience Burgess.<br />
Mercy (5), b. 4 April 1652. She married in January 1678/79 to Matthias Ellis, son of John Ellis and Elizabeth Freeman. They had nine children (see (3) for details and for more information on Matthias Ellis). She died after 13 November 1744.<br />
Caleb, b. after 1640. He m. Elizabeth Atwood. No further information available.<br />
Benjamin, b. after 1640. He d. 26 March 1676, killed by Indians at the Battle of Rehoboth in King Phillip's War.<br />
 <br />
2) Robert, b. 1630 in England, died in infancy.<br />
 <br />
The two children of Thomas Tupper and Susan Turner were:<br />
 <br />
3) Thomas Tupper, b. after 1628 in England. He died in infancy.<br />
4) Robert, b. 3 November 1633 in England. As an infant he must have gone to America with his mother, who died the next year in 1634 in Topsfield. Robert m. 9 May 1654 at Sandwich to Deborah Perry. No further information available.<br />
 <br />
Finally, the only child of Thomas Tupper and his third wife Anne Hodgson was:<br />
 <br />
5) Thomas Henry Tupper, b. 16 January 1637/38 at Sandwich, MA.<br />

Obviously there is a great deal of confusion over everything about Maud,but her first name--and that one of her husbands, at least, was John leStrange. Following are what some respected sources state:<br />
 <br />
Ancestral Roots (249-32) merely states "Maud de Walton" (no parents, which at least is the simplest way of dealing with Maud). They cite as source "(CP [Complete Peerage] XII (1) 353, 354; C. L'Estrange Ewen, 'Observations on the LeStranges' (1946), chart opp. p. 1; 'LeStrange Records', 184-254)."<br />
 <br />
Magna Charta Sureties (137-4) states "Maud, perhaps, a de Deyville. (CP XII (1), 352-353; 'Misc. Gen. et Her.', 5th Series, IX 254-8 says she was daughter of Sir John de Wauton of Wauton Deyville. See also 'Pedigree and Progress' (Wagner) ped. 57; 'Le Strange Records, 184-253)."<br />
 <br />
Note: other than a slight difference in page numbers, some commas, and Le Strange with or without a space, they seem to be quoting pretty much the same sources. MCS suggests she is daughter of Deyville, but gives the text of the source that suggests Sir John de Wauton.<br />
 <br />
Burke's Peerage states "Maud, daughter and heiress either of Roger de Deyville, of Walton Deyville, Warwicks, or of Ebles de Montibus, of Ketton, Rutland, leaving (presumably by his 2nd wife, since her putative paternity would account for the unusual forename Ebles being given to the 2nd son)."<br />
 <br />
------------------------------------------------------<br />
It looks like we have 3 choices for Maud: de Walton or Wauton, de Deyville, or de Montibus. I am definitely tilting toward "Maud de Wauton" since I found the following at the Stradling family website "www.stradling.org.uk/docs/Oth_recs.htm", which touches on the matter because Maud de Wauton married John de Stradling as her first husband. The website is quoting material from "VCH - Warwick extract":<br />
------------------------------------------------------<br />
 <br />
Victoria County History of Warwickshire.<br />
 <br />
A) vol 3, page 131<br />
"Certain lands in Losley [Loxley, of Robin Hood fame] were sold with the manor of Walton Mauduit by the Earl of Warwick to Simon de Wauton, Bishop of Norwich (1258-66). The bishop conveyed them to John de Wauton, who was probably his great-nephew. Subsequently John de Wauton received from Walter Giffard, Archbishop of York (1266-79), a grant of the two Walton manors and all his land in Loxley; this was possibly the carucate and 100s. in rents which Henry le Foun and Isabel his wife quitclaimed to the archbishop in 1278. The archbishop was perhaps acting as trustee for John de Wauton whose daughter and heir Maud, was in 1279 a ward of Godfrey Giffard, Bishop of Worcester, Walter's younger brother. Maud married, first John de Stradling by whom she had no issue, and secondly John le Strange. In 1294 it was said that John de Wauton had done homage for his land in Loxley to the Prior of Kenilworth and that John de Stradling had offered to do so, but that, as he had had no issue by his wife, the prior was unwilling to receive it."<br />
 <br />
B) Vol 5, page145,<br />
"The history of the portion of Wellesbourne north and east of the Dene Brook is obscure. Dugdale's assertion that it was granted by one of the ancient Earls of Warwick' to a member of the Hastang family is based only on the fact that in 1279 a very small estate, half a virgate, in Little Wellesbourne was held by Godfrey Giffard, Bishop of Worcester, of William Pacy, who held of Robert Hastang and he of the earl; if there was any such mesne lordship it has left no trace. In January 1246 Mr. Simon de Wauton (or Walton) received a grant of a weekly market on Wednesday and a fair on the eve and day of SS. Peter and Paul at his manor of LITTLE WELLESBOURNE. This Mr. Simon, who bought property in Walton Deyville, became Bishop of Norwich in 1258 and died in 1265. His successor Sir John de Wauton died in or shortly before 1277, leaving a widow Isabel, who married Henry le Foun, and a young daughter Maud. She married Sir John de Strattelinges, or Stradling, and they had a regrant of the market and Fair at Little Wellesboume in 1290. Sir John was dead by February 1293 and Maud married John Lestrange of Knockin, who died in 1309, leaving a son John. As her third husband she married Thomas Hastang, who was returned in 1316 as holding Walton with the hamlet of Wellesbourne, which from this time onwards becomes known as WELLESBOURNE HASTANG, or more often HASTINGS, or WELLESBOURNE LESTRANGE, and descends with the manors of Walton.<br />
 <br />
In 1086 the Count of Meulan held two estates of WALTON. One of these was rated at 5 hides and had been held by Saxi; the other, formerly held by Gida and Saied, was of 10 hides. Both came to the Earls of Warwick and in 1166 Earl William, in the return of his fees, notes that Walton used to render the service of one knight's fee but was then in demesne and held by his mother, the Countess Gundred, in dower. The overlordship continued attached to the earldom and is mentioned as late as 1639.<br />
 <br />
In the time of Henry I one part of Walton seems to have been held by Theodoric, or Tierry, and the other by Spilebert. When the family of Deyville, from whom the manor of WALTON DEYVILLE acquired its name, became enfeoffed here is uncertain, but Walter Deyville gave the tithe of his mill at Walton to the nuns of Pinley, probably about 1230. Robert Deyville was holding a knight's fee here from the Earl of Warwick in 1242 and Walter was granted free warren in his manor of Walton in 1252. His successor, Roger Deyville, became heavily indebted to the Jews and sold the manor to Simon de Wauton, who granted it to his son John. This Simon may have been identical with the Mr. Simon who held the manor of Welles-bourne Hastings (see above) and who in 1240 bought from William Mauduit and Alice his wife 6 acres in Walton called Litlemede lying beside the Portwey. Mr. Simon was elderly when he became bishop and may well have been married when young. John de Wauton died in 1277, and his widow Isabel married Henry le Foun. John's heir, his daughter Maud, was a child, and in 1278 Henry and Isabel conveyed the manors of Walton and other lands to Walter Giffard, Archbishop of York. On the death of Walter in the following year these estates passed to his brother Godfrey Giffard, Bishop of Worcester, who in 1281 conveyed them to Robert Burnel, Bishop of Bath and Wells, for life, with remainder to Maud, whom he undertook to marry to one of the elder sons of either his brother Hugh Burnel or of Sir Robert de Escales. As already mentioned, however, Maud married first Sir John de Strattelinges and secondly John Lestrange of Knockin, and thirdly Thomas Hastang."<br />
