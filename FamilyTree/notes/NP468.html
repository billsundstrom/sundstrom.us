Gadys Ethel RYLANDER
<p>
<a name ="I062976"><b>[I062976]</b></a><br />
Gladys Ethel Rylander Crismier, age 94, was born May 31, 1918, in Detroit, MI, and was promoted to glory November 3, 2012, in Riverside, CA. The third of eight children of Alma (Bjorkman) and John V. Rylander, Gladys thrived in her lively Swedish family and in the Salvation Army Corps where they attended church. Musically gifted as a child, Gladys honed her skills at the piano and in piano pedagogy and choral conducting throughout her life, studying at the St. Louis Institute of Music, Friends University (Wichita, KS) and later at Rio Hondo College. Her artistry as church pianist attracted the attention of a young preacher, Charles ("Cris") Crismier, Jr., whom she married in 1943 and with whom she shared the joys and challenges of Christian ministry for 64 years until his death in 2007. <br>
The epitome of a Proverbs 31 woman, Gladys emulated that model as an active piano and Bible study teacher, choir director, composer and arranger, taking great delight in the publication of one of her arrangements in 1994. Equally at home in a hardware store or at her sewing machine, expertly designing and crafting beautiful clothes or home furnishings, she had a creative flair, do-it-yourself skills and a diligent work ethic that enabled her family to live with grace and elegance on modest means in a series of church pastorates from coast to coast. She and Cris ultimately settled in Riverside in 1987. Gladys sought to do every task, large or small, with integrity, all to the glory of God and in the fear of the Lord. Her children "rise up and call her blessed" (Proverbs 31:28) for the example she set for them in modeling faithful devotion to the Lord and her family. <br>
Preceded in death by her husband and ministry partner, Dr. Charles Crismier, Jr., her beloved daughter, Karin Crismier Padilla, and four siblings, Gladys is survived by son Chuck (Kathie) Crismier, son Ken (Thu Huong) Crismier, daughter-in-law Rose Crismier, son-in-law Ray Padilla, son Bob (Candy) Crismier, and daughter Carolyne (Stephen) Nielson. She is also survived by ten grandchildren: Nicole Crismier (Michael) Akyeampong, Shannon Crismier (Oscar) Venegas, Lisa Crismier (Doug) Talley, Alan (Heather) Crismier, Cherise Crismier (Ryan) Felker, Kendra Crismier (Michael) Daoang, Derek Crismier, Christiana Nielson, Caroline Nielson and Carlton Crismier; 12 great-grandchildren: Daniel, Carissa, Nathanael and Micaiah Akyeampong; Paris, Felicity and Tennyson Talley; Zander, Hayden and Carrington Felker; Tyler and Ali Crismier; sister Doris Rylander Wallstrom, brothers Wesley Rylander and Marvin Rylander, and many nieces and nephews. <br>
Graveside services at 9:00 a.m. on November 14, 2012, Forest Lawn-Covina Hills. A memorial service in celebration of Gladys' life will be held at 11:00 a.m., November 14, 2012, Arlington Avenue Church of the Nazarene, 5475 Arlington Avenue, Riverside, CA, followed by a lunch reception and fellowship. In lieu of flowers, memorial contributions may be made to Arlington Avenue Church of the Nazarene in Gladys' honor.<br>
