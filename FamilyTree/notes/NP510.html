OTTAWA (AP) _ William Watson Southam, a vice-president of the Southam newspaper group for 27 years, has died at the age of 80.<br>
Southam died Wednesday of a heart attack after a game of tennis in Toronto. Southam Inc. is Canada's largest communications and information company and owns 15 daily newspapers.<br>
A third-generation member of the family dynasty, Southam was the son of William James Southam, a former publisher of the Hamilton Spectator.<br>
He began his career as a reporter for the Vancouver Province in 1930 and held various positions in the newsroom. By 1945, he was production manager and moved to Southam's head office in Montreal to become vice-president.<br>
Southam's son Peter, 54, said Thursday his father was most interested in the production of the newspapers.<br>
''He was mostly in the technical side,'' said Southam, manager in the company's department of corporate and technical services at the head office in Toronto.<br>
''He had a deep interest in the presses, in the material things and in the administrative side all along.''<br>
Southam retired in 1972. He travelled widely and played tennis three days a week. He and his wife, Kitten, spent their winters in Florida.<br>

ALFRED - Zoë S. Coombs, 85, passed away Monday (July 23, 2018) at Noyes Memorial Hospital in Dansville following a brief illness.<br>
Mrs. Coombs was born on Aug. 8, 1932 in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada to William Watson and Katinka Raimondi (Young) Southam. In 1955, she married Neal Philip Coombs, who predeceased her on Dec. 16, 1986. She earned her B.A. in History from Alfred University in 1985.<br>
Zoë worked as a secretary for Alfred University for 17 years until her retirement in 1995.<br>
Zoë is survived by one son, Kevin M. (Barbara) Coombs of Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada; one brother, Peter Y. (Elsa) Southam of Toronto, Ontario, Canada; two grandsons, Daniel T. (Sherilyn) Coombs and William M. (Elizabeth Dow) Coombs, both of Winnipeg; two half-brothers, Kenneth Southam and Brian Southan; one half-sister, Brenda Seasons; and several nieces, nephews and cousins.<br>
In addition to her husband, she was predeceased by a daughter, Sherryl Coombs; a sister, Patricia M. Southam O'Sullivan; and a half-brother, Michael Southam.<br>
Zoë lived a busy and very active life. In her early years she was an avid sportswoman, playing basketball in high school, volleyball in college and was an excellent tennis player. She was a voracious reader of all kinds of literature, especially mysteries. She loved food, wine and the next adventure, all of which dovetailed perfectly with her desire to tour the world. Zoë traveled to 44 different countries during her adventures.<br>
Zoë was an accomplished seamstress and enjoyed knitting. In later years she took up weaving, quilting and gardening. It wasn't by accident that she was Co-President of Fortnightly Garden Club of Hornell and was a member of the Knitwits Knitting Group.<br>
Zoë was also very civic minded. She was a member of the Allegany Bird Club, the Alfred Historical Society and the Alfred Wee Playhouse. As a mother, Zoë encouraged this same civic mindedness in her children and nurtured them to grow and develop their own independence and to spread their wings.<br>
