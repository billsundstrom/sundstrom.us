<a name ="I044598"><b>[I044598]</b></a><br />
LILIAN McKEEN Peacefully in her sleep at home, on August 29, 2000, Lilian McKeen passed away. Left to cherish her memory are her children, Jill (Eric), Penny (Ed), Ken (Christina) and Shelley (Richard) grandchildren, Derrin, Kimberly, Corey, Julie and Samantha; brother Arthur and many cousins and their families in England. Mom was predeceased by her husband of 50 years, Norman McKeen (1997), her parents Emily and Horace Hoyle, brother Fred and sister Winnie and her first husband Leslie Tindall (1941). After being widowed during the war, our fiercely independent mom traveled from England to Winnipeg with Jill in hand in the winter of 1947, to marry Norm McKeen. They shared 50 great years together raising their children, camping and traveling and retiring to their cottage at West Hawk Lake. Mom worked at various jobs with Eatons, Thompson caterers and the Pub at West Hawk Lake. Our beautiful mom loved getting dressed up and going dancing with dad. Bingo was her second passion. She was known to have a green thumb. She could play Bridge with the best of them. She was also a great cook. Since Dads passing, she was fortunate in finding friends to socialize with in her apartment block. She looked forward to sitting outside and chatting on hot evenings. Many a Saturday afternoon she could be found roaming the local malls with Penny. Cremation has taken place. A memorial service will be held on Friday, September 1, at 2:00 p.m. at Klassen Funeral Chapel, 1897 Henderson Hwy. In lieu of flowers, if friends so desire, donations may be made to the Humane Society, 5 Kent St., Winnipeg, Man., R2L 1X3. Mom, we love you and will miss you. We hope they are playing Spanish Eyes. Arrangements entrusted to Klassen Funeral Chapel.<br>
