Thelma Gwendolyn BRACY
<p>
<a name ="I118398"><b>[I118398]</b></a><br />
Thelma Gwendolyn (Bracy) Hinckley , widow of Henry R. Hinckley , the founder of The Henry R. Hinckley Co. in Southwest Harbor, ME, died August 17, 2005, in Juno Beach, FL. Gwen was born December 21, 1913, in Portland, ME, the daughter of Ervin Grant Bracy and Margaret (Williams) Bracy. The influenza pandemic of 1919 brought the death of her mother and an infant twin brother. Because her father's work with Socony Mobil kept him away from home, she spent much of her early life, from the age of 6, with her Williams relatives in Salmon Creek New Brunswick. Her high school years were spent in Southwest Harbor with her father's family.<br>
On January 16, 1934, in Portland, Gwen married Henry R. Hinckley II of Southwest Harbor and Northampton, MA. Henry and Gwen made their first home in Bar Harbor, later moving to Southwest Harbor to be nearer to their business, The Henry R. Hinckley Co. As the Hinckley Boatyard thrived, so did their young family. The busy young mother of five played a very active role in the growing of family and business. With few hotels and restaurants available, Gwen's home and hearth were always open to clients, friends, and tradesmen. A roast beef in the oven, or lobsters in the pot, all were welcome. Gwen's open friendly disposition and quick sense of humor won her many friends in the local and yachting communities. Sharing bed and board with the Hinckley family, many yacht owners would come to consider themselves bona fide members of the Hinckley family.<br>
In the late '50s, Henry and Gwen began to spend most of the year in Florida, first settling in Ft. Lauderdale, then later in North Palm Beach at Old Port Cove. Gwen took special pleasure watching the yachting activities beneath the window of their 4th floor condominium. As it became increasingly difficult for her to maintain her home, she relocated to an apartment in the assisted living community at The Waterford in Juno Beach.<br>
Affectionately called Mama Gwen, she is survived by three sons: Robert L. Hinckley and his wife Tina of Southwest Harbor and Wellington, FL, Edward W. Hinckley and his wife Tessie of Palm Beach Gardens, FL, and Henry R. Hinckley III and his wife Theo of Southwest Harbor; two daughters: Ann H. Levy and her husband Melvin of Wellington and Jane H. Hosack of Wellington; 15 grandchildren: Cindy Oliva Andrews, Jill Hinckley Spaulding, Bryan B. Hosack, Benjamin B. Hinckley III, Edward B. Hinckley , George L. Hinckley , Elizabeth H. Foregger, Carol H. DeLacey, Benjamin Oliva, Julie Hinckley , Katherine H. McCleddand, Samuel Hinckley , Amanda H. Jacobs, Sarah Hinckley , and Nathanial Hinckley ; as well as 10 great-grandchildren. Gwen was predeceased by her parents, her husband in 1980, and grandson, Daniel Oliva, in 1993. She is also survived by her brother, Roland Bracy of Portland, and several nieces and nephews.<br>

<p>
<a name ="I111445"><b>[I111445]</b></a><br />
BEVERLY - When the Bradley family lost their only son, 19-year-old Benjamin, in a tragic auto accident in April 2001, they wanted to do something to honor his memory.<br>
So his sisters, Erin and Corey, came up with the idea of hosting an annual beach volleyball tournament in his name. Ben loved to play and was a fixture doing so all summer long at West Beach in the Farms section of the city; he and his friends would play for hours on end. The tournament seemed like a no-brainer.<br>
But now, after 10 years of running what has become one of the hallmark summer sports events in the Garden City, the Bradleys have come to the decision that it's time to end it.<br>
"We decided it's been 10 wonderful years and wanted to go out on a good note," said Sandy Bradley, Ben's mother. "There's only so much you can ask people to donate and contribute and help.<br>
