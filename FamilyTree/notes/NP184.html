PILOT WHO LOVED TO FLY CRASHES AT NIAGARA SHOW<br>
SOUTH SALEM - An entrepreneur who a friend said had "flying in his blood" died Sunday afternoon when his plane crashed into the Niagara River in an air show witnessed by more than 20,000 people.<br>
Gifford "Giff" Foley, 43, of South Salem in Westchester County was flying a World War II A-T6 training plane when the accident occurred in U.S. waters about 800 yards from the Canadian border, according to Petty Officer James Nesselbush of the Coast Guard.<br>
Alone in the sky, Foley's plane "seemed to be going into a turn" but then apparently took a nose dive and plunged into the river, Nesselbush said.<br>
Divers found Foley's body in the cockpit under about 19 feet of water off Buffalo Harbor where the river flows into Lake Erie, he said.<br>
The Federal Aviation Administration is investigating the crash, said Kathleen Bergen, an agency spokeswoman.<br>
Foley was described by friends as an entrepreneur with a soaring spirit who attended all the best schools and loved to race old planes.<br>
"He was a very unique individual," said Ken Wilson of Katonah, who was Foley's roommate at Dartmouth College and the Harvard Business School. "Flying was in his blood."<br>
A former Marine who received numerous decorations for his service in Vietnam, Foley owned four businesses in the Northeast and often commuted to each in one of his private planes, Wilson said. Foley's businesses included a manufacturing company in Massachusetts and a consulting firm in Danbury, Conn., he said.<br>
Foley had been flying for about 15 years and lately had been in the air "two or three days a week," Wilson said. "He used to participate in a lot of air races."<br>
As a pilot, Foley was "very highly skilled and qualified for the low- level flight activity by the appropriate officials," said Garson Fields of Northampton, Mass., who owned several airplanes with Foley and had first known him while they attended Kent School in Connecticut.<br>
"It was his real love in life," Fields said.<br>
His widow, April Foley, said she did not join her husband in Buffalo for the air show because she had taken the couple's three children to visit their grandparents.<br>
At least 20,000 spectators had gathered along the river in Buffalo to watch the show, which was part of the fourth annual International Friendship Festival celebrating good relations between the United States and Canada, Nesselbush said. He said thousands more lined the Canadian shore.<br>
This year was the first time the festival sponsored an air show. At least 10 pilots were scheduled to perform, but the rest of the show was canceled after the crash.<br>

Giff Foley had a profound impact on Kent. A leader in all aspects of school life during his three years here, Giff excelled as a multi-sport athlete, earning seven letters in football, wrestling and crew. His senior year he served as a Prefect, captained the football team and was awarded Pater's Mug as the outstanding male athlete in the School. He attended Dartmouth College where he continued his success as a standout football player. After earning two letters and All-Ivy honorable mention honors, Giff took a leave from Dartmouth to join the U.S. Marine Corps where he served with honor in Vietnam and was awarded a Silver Star. Returning to Dartmouth, he rejoined the football team and anchored the defensive line on the undefeated championship team of 1970 that won the Lambert Trophy as the best team in the east. That year Dartmouth nominated Giff for the "Swede" Nelson Award, recognizing "outstanding achievement in academics, athletics, sportsmanship and citizenship" among the leading football players in New England.<br>
After graduation Giff earned an MBA degree at Harvard Business School. He married April, a classmate at Harvard, and together they raised three children Giff Jr. (Kent '98), Catherine and James. He was invited to join the Board of Trustees and served with distinction when the school embarked on the successful campus consolidation program. He was a true son of Kent who made the School a better place for his having been here. Giff left us far too soon and rests up on Skiff Mountain where his inscription reads:<br>
Soldier, scholar, horseman he. What made us dream that he could comb grey hair?<br>

Elmer Severance FORBES
<p>
<a name ="I070178"><b>[I070178]</b></a><br />
Elmer Severance Forbes was born at Westboro, Massachusetts, on September 12, 1860, of an old New England stock that had been eminently serviceable in Massachusetts for ten generations. He graduated at Amherst College in 1881, and entered the ministry of the Protestant Episcopal Church, becoming one of the staff and later the rector of St. Johnʼs Church in Jersey City. It was a large parish in a location where many and diverse social problems had to be met and the young clergyman was soon absorbed in matters of poor relief, of housing and hygiene, of the adjustments of family life, and of the care of the delinquent and defective. He was a diligent and cheerful worker in both church and community, but gradually he found himself becoming more interested in the social applications of religion than in the theologies and rituals of the church. When he realized that he no longer believed the creeds, he honorably withdrew from the Episcopalian communion and sought admission to the Unitarian ministry. He quickly won the confidence and affection of his new associates while retaining the good will of many of his former comrades. His rare gifts of mind and heart together with his successful experience both as a parish minister and as an expert in social work, all pointed to him as the right man to inaugurate the work of the new Department of Community Service of the American Unitarian Association. For twenty-one years, until his retirement in 1929, he administered that department with diligence and fidelity, efficiently representing the interest of Unitarians in social reforms. It was at first a pioneer service, for the Unitarian communion was the earliest of the Protestant churches to initiate such an enterprise and many people had to be persuaded of its importance. Mr. Forbes traveled far and wide and increasingly convinced ministers and people not only that a collective endeavor for social reforms was possible and practical, but also that there was an essential unity of purpose in the Unitarian churches in regard to the application of religious principles to social problems. He organized and addressed many Conferences, gathered and edited the forty or fifty influential and widely distributed pamphlets published as the "Social Service Bulletins"; prepared the volume on the Social Ideals of a Free Church, counseled with many ministers and committees in regard to their social agencies and activities, represented the Unitarian Fellowship at interdenominational conferences at home and abroad and served on many administrative boards and committees-always judicious, persuasive, attractive. He was not a violent or aggressive reformer, but gentle of speech, courteous and considerate in manner, fraternal in spirit. His judgments were deliberate but no plan for human welfare failed to secure his study and interest, and, if found worthy, his resolute advocacy. He fought error and evil, but always chivalrously.<br>
Elmer Forbes was a man of true spiritual refinement, and at the same time and in the best sense a sensible and practical man of the world. He was eager to apply religious faiths and truths to healthy uses. He was always ready with wise counsel and self-denying service, bold in pleading for unfamiliar reforms and in denouncing popular mistakes and injustices. Kindly and tolerant, he was a charming companion and loyal friend. He died at Plattsburg, New York, July 2, 1933.<br>

Christine FORD
<p>
<a name ="I118025"><b>[I118025]</b></a><br />
BALDWIN -- Christine F. 'Chris' Podlaski, 63, of Cram Road, died on July 23, 2009, at the Maine Medical Center in Portland after a courageous battle with cancer. She was born in Chelsea, Mass., on June 25, 1946, the daughter of Francis and Doris Tibbetts Ford and attended Chelsea schools. At the age of 7, she told Ronald Podlaski that she was going to marry him, and she did on Oct. 25, 1963. They spent the next two decades in Massachusetts. She worked for several years at Poly-Paks in Wakefield, Mass. as a supervisor. She also had worked as a manager at Marshall's Distribution Center in Woburn, Mass. Ron's job moved them to Maine in 1981, and they have lived here happily ever since. She enjoyed many hobbies including, cake decorating, playing bingo and gardening. She also had an amazing talent for sewing. Her latest project was a very special quilt that was made for her daughters. Helping people was perhaps her greatest gift.
