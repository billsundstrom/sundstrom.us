Edward Ernest WESTOVER
<p>

MOBERLY, Mo. - Edward Eugene Westover, 78, formerly from Clear Lake, died on Saturday (May 10, 2003) at his home in Moberly, Mo.<br>
Mr. Westover was born on Dec. 13,1924, at Clear Lake, Iowa, the son of Edward E. and Geneva (Bisgrove) Westover.<br>
He served in the U.S. Navy from 1942-1946.<br>
In 1947, he married Maxine Prescott and she survives at the home in Moberly, Mo.<br>
Mr. Westover farmed and worked in Iowa until his retirement and moved to Clark, Mo., at that time.<br>
Survivors include a son, Larry Westover of Clear Lake, Iowa; two daughters, Judy Anderson and husband, David, of Clear Lake, and Sharon Deling and husband Dan of Moberly, Mo.; three grandchildren, Nicole Lyon and husband, Mike of Sherburn, Minn., Travis Anderson, of Clear Lake, and Tanya Deling of Moberly, Mo.; three great-grandchildren, Ashley and Katelyn of Sherburn, Minn., and Amber of Moberly, Mo.; and a sister, Ellen Mae Ouverson of Clear Lake.<br>
He was preceded in death by his parents; a son, Garry; two brothers, Glenn and George Westover; and one sister, Gertrude Marion.<br>
Ed or Gene we never knew which name to call him. When he farmed and worked at the sugar beet plant he was known as Gene. When he worked at Winnebago and IMT he was known as Ed. But to the family he was known as a loving and caring husband, father, grand-father, and great grandfather.<br>
In our eyes he achieved raising us with many interests, from hunting, trail riding to putting up with 4-H projects with his children and grandchildren.<br>
His most enjoyment was his wood working projects, especially the buggy seats of which more than one has made it to different states. So if you see a buggy seat, then possibly you will see a small piece of what he enjoyed doing the most in his retirement years.<br>
His body will be cremated and no service will be performed as were his wishes. He wanted people to remember him as he was.<br>
