Bela III of HUNGARY
<p>
<a name ="I008428"><b>[I008428]</b></a><br />
From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia.<br>
(Redirected from Bela III of Hungary)<br>
<br>
Béla III of Hungary (Hungarian III. Béla, Slovak: Belo III), born in 1148, was King of Kingdom of Hungary circa 1172-1196. He was the son of King Geza II of Hungary and Euphrosyne (daughter of Grand Duke Mstislav of Kiev).<br>
<br>
As a boy he was sent to Constantinople to be educated in the court of the Emperor, Manuel I Comnenus, who intended Béla to succeed him and betrothed him to his daughter, Maria. However, when a son was born to the Emperor this engagement was broken, but another marriage was arranged between Béla and Agnes de Chatillon, a princess of Antioch. She was also the half-sister of the Empress Maria.<br>
<br>
Béla III succeeded his brother Stephen III of Hungary and was crowned under the influence of the Byzantine Emperor Manuel I Comnenus. As the new king, Béla adopted Catholicism and crowned his son Emeric as his successor. He was a powerful ruler, and his court was counted among the most brilliant in Europe.<br>
<br>
Béla was a warrior by nature and training, and the death of the Emperor Manuel I Comnenus in 1180 left him free to expand Hungarian power in the Balkans. His attempt to recover Dalmatia led Hungary into two wars against Venice, and ultimately faltered. He also aided the Serbs against the Byzantine Empire. At the time of his death Béla was assisting the Emperor Isaac II Angelus in a war against Bulgaria. He was succeeded by both of his sons in turn, Emeric and Andrew.<br>

Béla IV of HUNGARY
<p>
<a name ="I008420"><b>[I008420]</b></a><br />
From Wikipedia<br>
<br>
Béla IV (1206-1270) was the king of Hungary between 1235 and 1270.<br>
<br>
Béla was the son of King András II and Gertrude of Meran. His mother was murdered by Hungarian magnates in 1213, when he was a boy. His father having failed to avenge Queen Gertrude, it was left to Béla to track down and punish his mother's murderers, a campaign which he finally completed some thirty years after her death.<br>
<br>
In 1218 he was married to Maria Laskarina, the daughter of Emperor Theodore I Lascaris Nicaea. Their children were:<br>
   1. Kinga, married King Boleslaus V of Poland<br>
   2. King István V<br>
   3. Erzsébet, married Duke Henry XIII of Lower Bavaria<br>
   4. Margit, later canonized as St. Margaret in 1943. She lent her name to Margaret Island.<br>
<br>
In 1238, Hungary was invaded by Kuman tribes fleeing the advancing Mongol hordes. Béla sought to ally with the Kumans, and so he granted them asylum and betrothed his son and heir Stephen to the daughter of a Kuman khan named Kuthen. The Kumans (originally a pagan shamanist people) converted to Christianity and were baptised. They fought beside the Hungarians against the Mongols.<br>
<br>
Béla tried with little success to reestablish royal preeminence by reacquiring lost crown lands. His efforts, however, created a deep rift between the crown and the magnates just as the Mongols were sweeping westward across Russia toward Europe. Aware of the danger, Béla ordered the magnates and lesser nobles to mobilize. Few responded, and the Mongols routed Bela's army at Mohi on April 11, 1241. His ally Kuthen had been killed by mistrustful Hungarian lords in Pest just prior to the invasion.<br>
<br>
Béla fled first to Austria, where Duke Frederick of Babenberg held him for ransom, then to Dalmatia. The Mongols reduced Hungary's towns and villages to ashes and slaughtered half the population before news arrived in 1242 that the Great Ögedei Khan had died in Karakorum. The Mongols withdrew, sparing Béla and what remained of his kingdom.<br>

Geza I of HUNGARY
<p>
<a name ="I015212"><b>[I015212]</b></a><br />
Géza I (Slovak: Gejza) (c. 1040 - 1077) was the king of the Kingdom of Hungary from 1074 to 1077.<br>
<br>
For his coronation, Géza received a crown from Byzantine Emperor Michael VII Dukas that was incorporated with the ancient crown of King Stephen I. Géza's short rule was characterized by general disorder in the kingdom. He did, however, capture Croatia from his brother-in-law Dmitar Zvonimir. He married twice; first to Sophia von Looz, daughter of the Count of Looz, and secondly to Synadene, a niece of Emperor Nicephorus III. By his first marriage, he had two children:<br>
   1. Coloman of Hungary<br>
   2. Prince Álmos<br>
<br>
Géza died on April 25, 1077 and was succeeded by his brother Ladislaus I. Géza is buried at Vác.<br>
</p>
Geza of HUNGARY
<p>
<a name ="I007825"><b>[I007825]</b></a><br />
Géza of Hungary (born around 940-945, died in 997) (possibly Gyécsa in Old Hungarian, Gejza in Slovak), was the fejedelem (ruling prince) of the Magyars from c. 970 to 997.<br>
<br>
Géza was the son of Taksony, ruling prince of the Magyars and his Cuman wife, and was the great-grandson of Árpád, who gave his name to the ruling dynasty. Although still a pagan when he became ruler, the alliance concluded between the Holy Roman Empire and Byzantium in 972 forced Géza to convert to Christianity in order to secure a lasting peace for Hungary. He turned to the Holy Roman Emperor Otto I, who ordained a Benedictine monk, Bruno of Sankt Gallen, as bishop and sent him to Hungary to baptise Géza (this occurred in 985 according to some sources). However, although he was mainly accepted as a Christian ruler it is doubtful that he was a Christian at heart. According to the Bishop of Merseburg he continued to worship pagan gods.<br>
<br>
Although overshadowed by his son, King Stephen I of Hungary, Géza made considerable achievements during his reign. He established centralised rule over the entire country, except for Transylvania which remained under the separate authority of the gyula. This allowed him to collect taxies and duties far more successfully than his predecessors and thus increase his personal wealth.<br>
<br>
Géza's wife was Sarolt, daughter of Gyula of Transylvania, and who was brought up as a Christian. Géza had a brother named Michael (born in 955 at Esztergom), who became Regent of Poland and died about 978.<br>
</p>
Istvan V of HUNGARY
<p>
<a name ="I008416"><b>[I008416]</b></a><br />
From Wikipedia<br>
<br>
King Stephen V of Hungary (Hungarian: V. István, Slovak: Štefan V) (1239 or 1240 - August 6, 1272), was the eldest son of Bela IV of Hungary, whom he succeeded in 1270.<br>
<br>
As crown prince he had exhibited considerable ability, but also a disquieting restlessness and violence. In 1262 Stephen convinced his father Bela to give him twenty-nine counties as a reward of assistance in the war against Bohemia; hence Hungary was virtually divided into two kingdoms. He subsequently seized the southern banate of Macsó and defeated his father in the ensuing civil war. In 1268 he undertook an expedition against the Bulgarians, penetrating as far as Tirnova and styling himself as king of Bulgaria.<br>
<br>
Stephen's father, attempting to bind the powerful but pagan Cumans tribe more closely to the dynasty, arranged for Stephen's marriage, as a youth (about 1255), to Elizabeth, the daughter of the Cuman chieftain (named Koteny or Kuthens). Though Elizabeth, in preparation for the marriage, had been baptized and remained a Christian, western Europe almost universally considered Stephen as a semi-pagan. This hostility was felt as Stephen declared himself that everyone was his enemy for his accession to the Hungarian throne.<br>
<br>
To secure foreign support, he formed a double matrimonial alliance with the Angevins, chief partisans of the pope. The first of these was the marriage in 1270 of his daughter Maria to Charles II of Naples (they became grandparents of Charles I of Hungary). The second alliance was the marriage of Stephen's infant son Ladislaus to Charles II's sister Elisabeth.<br>
<br>
Byzantine Emperor Andronicus II married Anna, another of Stephen's daughters. Serbian king Stefan Dragutin married Katerina, yet another of Stephan's daughters.<br>
<br>
Adversaries of Stephen, especially Ottokar II of Bohemia, believed that Stephen was too great a friend of the mighty Cumans (who could field 16,000 men) to be a true Catholic. Ottakar endeavoured with the aid of the Hungarian malcontents to conquer the western provinces of Hungary but they were utterly routed by Stephen in 1271 near Mosony. Ottakar relinquished all his conquests the same year in the peace of Pressburg.<br>
<br>
Stephen died suddenly as he was raising an army to rescue his kidnapped infant son Ladislaus from his rebellious vassals.<br>
</p>
Taksony of HUNGARY
<p>
<a name ="I007827"><b>[I007827]</b></a><br />
Taksony (c. 905 - 970) (Slovak: Taksonn) was the fejedelem (ruling prince) of Hungary between 955 and 970. We have few details on his life. His father was Zoltan of Hungary.<br>
<br>
Taksony's policies were a change from the previous habit of the Hungarian leaders of conducting rapid raids on neighbouring countries, as he was probably present at the Battle of Lechfeld, where the Hungarian army was defeated and lost its leader Bulcsú. Relations with the Byzantine Empire progressively deteriorated, possibly due to progaganda from the Holy Roman Emperor Otto who depicted the Hungarians as ungodly. In the second half of his reign Taksony increasingly pursued campaigns against Byzantine Empire. Although Taksony asked the pope to send a bishop to Hungary (a request which was thwarted by Otto), he didn't follow an open policy to the spreading of Christianity within his realm.<br>
<br>
Taksony arranged the marriage of his son Géza to Sarolt, the daughter of the Gyula of Transylvania. He also had a son called Michael.<br>
</p>
Zoltan of HUNGARY
<p>
<a name ="I007830"><b>[I007830]</b></a><br />
Zoltán, also known as Zolta, Zaltas, or Zsolt, is probably the name of the son of Árpád and the father of Taksony and possibly Jutas. Gesta Hungarorum names Zolta as the son and successor of Árpád. Although he ruled Hungary from 900 to 955, his leadership meant much less than with previous leaders, as during his time, tribal leaders had most of the powers.<br>
<br>
In this era, the raids of Hungarians were common in much of Europe.<br>
