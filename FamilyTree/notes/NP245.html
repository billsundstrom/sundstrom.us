<h2>Notes</h2>
Esther Grace HESSE
<p>
<a name ="I065046"><b>[I065046]</b></a><br />
Esther Long, 91, of Everett, left this world as she lived her life, with dignity and grace surrounded by her family at her home on August 19, 2006. She fought a 22 month battle with cancer and was courageous to the end. She will forever be an inspiration to all who knew her.<br>
She was born November 16, 1914, in Brooten, Minnesota, to Carl and Sadie (Westover) Hesse. As the second of 11 children, she was only able to finish 8th grade before she was needed at home to help care for her family which she did so lovingly. At the age of 22 she moved to Spokane, Washington, where she met and later married Bill Long. The Navy brought them to Whidbey Island and they settled in Everett in 1952, to raise their four children.<br>
Ester worked 35 long hard years at the Sports Center Café. She had many fond memories of her time there. After her retirement at 72 she started another chapter in her life. She took cake decorating classes at Everett Community College and along with her daughter-in-law, Kay, made several beautiful wedding and birthday cakes for friends and family. Her last wedding cake was just eight years ago. She was also famous for her yummy chocolate chip cookies, lemon meringue pies, buttermilk hot cakes, and her carrot cake was out of this world. <br>
She started arthritis water classes at the Y in 1995, and continued until March when her health kept her away. She enjoyed immensely and never gave up hope that she someday would return. Her spirit and spunk will remain with her special friends Ione, Jean and all the others who meant so much to her. To know Esther was to love her. She was always upbeat, never lost her sense of humor and always had a good joke for anyone who was willing to listen. She was rarely discouraged and even learned to navigate a computer at the age of 91. She loved to garden and was especially proud of her sweet peas. She was a big fan of the Mariners, Seahawks, and Silvertips and she loved to eat! Among her favorite places were the Olive Garden, Darumas, the Flying Pig and the Strawberry Patch Café. She will be missed by anyone who was fortunate to know her.<br>
She is now in heaven with her parents, her brothers, Don, Lynn, Chuck, James, and Jackie; her sisters, Doris, Gladys, and Pearl.<br>
She is survived by her children and their spouses, Bill and Lotte Long, Bev and Skip Pearson, Joan and Bob Burns, and Kay (Gary) Nieman, who was always a daughter in her eyes. She also leaves her sister Betty Thielen and Lola Berg of Minnesota, along with many nieces and nephews. She will remain forever in the hearts of all her grandchildren and their families, Janet and Dean Anderson (Jamie and Garrett), Kim and George Meritt (Nick), Lisa and Kevin English (Cory, Alicia and Jennifer), Don and Julia Long (Margaret, Katherine, Lauren and Amanda [great-grandchildren of Esther's twins]), Jeff and Trishana Pearson (Micaela and Noah), Mark and Laurie Long (Bobby, Casi, Jeff, and Celine), Dave and Corazon Pearson (Ashley), Chris and Jenni Burns (Aiden, Eamon, and Guenna), Carrie and CJ Vincent (Jazmin), Jared and Tatiana Long, and Megan Long.<br>
Nothing was more important to Esther than family, but once you knew her she considered you family. She will be missed by her long time neighbors Marina and Abraham, Fede and Larry and their families, along with the Adrians who were all so kind and generous to her over the years.* She will be remembered by her good friend Marvel Craig and her "other daughers", Sheralyn Vanassche and Annette Kerber.<br>
Special thanks to everyone at the John Flynn Cancer Center, especially Mark, Mary, and Pam; who always treated her with respect and kindness. And to Drs. Adam, Cole and Miley who provided excellent care.<br>
Please join us for celebration of her life at 2p.m., Saturday, September 9, 2006, at The First Methodist Church, 3530 Colby Avenue, Everett. <br>
Memorials can be made to the John Flynn Cancer Center or Everett YMCA scholarship fund.<br>
She will be missed by anyone who was fortunate to know her.<br>

<a name ="I109747"><b>[I109747]</b></a><br />
Lester Tottenham Hibbard passed away peacefully surrounded by members of his loving family on October 3, 2016. A physician by profession, he was appreciated by all who knew him for his unique sense of humor and relish in telling a good story.<br>
Born in Los Angeles to parents Kathleen and Hudson, Lester received his high school diploma from Harvard School in 1937 (where he was Valedictorian), his undergraduate degree (economics, with distinction) from Stanford University in 1941, and his M.D. from the University of Pennsylvania in 1944. After serving briefly as a Captain in the Army Medical Corp at the end of World War II, Lester returned to Los Angeles and established a private practice in obstetrics and gynecology. In his long and distinguished medical career, Lester served on numerous medical boards and committees; authored or co-authored many peer reviewed articles; wrote the chapter on caesarian section for Obstetrics, Normal and Problem Pregnancies, still a standard reference in the field; and wrote scripts for nearly two dozen medical training films, some of which won awards at medical film competitions and festivals. He also taught obstetrics and gynecology for over three decades at the Keck School Medicine at the University of Southern California, where he became the Vice Chairman of the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology in 1979. As a teacher, he was much beloved. At his last lecture, his students honored him by all wearing red socks-his favorite, and only, sock color.<br>
Lester retired from medical practice and teaching in 1986. The Lester T. Hibbard Award, established in his honor, is awarded annually to the outstanding senior resident at the Women's Hospital, Los Angeles County-USC Medical Center.<br>
