MRS. HUNTOON AT REST.<br>
A Pioneer Who Came to Kansas in 1857<br>
Mrs. Ellen S. Huntoon, whose funeral took place on Wednesday afternoon, was one of the first settlers of Topeka, having come here with her husband, Colonel Joel Huntoon, forty-one years ago. <br>
Mrs. Huntoon whose maiden name was Ellen S. Richardson, was born at Alstead, N. H., December 2, 1823, and was married at the same place to Mr. Joel Huntoon, May 22, 1845, and moved the same year to Lawrenceville, Pa., where they lived until April 1857, when they came to Kansas.<br>
Their journey from Kansas City, Mo., to Topeka was made in a lumber wagon. Soon after arriving in Topeka, Colonel Huntoon preempted eighty acres of land which now forms part of the city of Topeka, and upon which the family home now stands. <br>
There were seven children, one of whom died in infancy, and another, Joel Huntoon, Jr., who was well known here, died in 1895. Of those now living there were present at the funeral, Loudean P., now of Fort Wayne, Ind.; Fred R., living near Topeka; Eva J., wife of Rev. P. M. Griffin, now of Brockton, Mass.; Nellie H., wife of C. Sim, now of Wichita. Another son, Fritz A., now of San Jose, Cal., was not present at the funeral, but there were present several grandchildren and great grandchildren. The sons acted as pallbearers.<br>
Mrs. Huntoon was a member of the Episcopal church and her quiet and lovable disposition was manifest to all about her, and she was especially known and esteemed by all the earlier settlers of Topeka. Her life was one of loving devotion to her children and her love of flowers and little children was her strong characteristic. Her bereaved husband and children have the sympathy of a large circle of friends.<br>
