<p>
<a name ="I040085"><b>[I040085]</b></a><br />
Christopher Avery, the emigrant ancestor and progenitor of the Avery family, was born in England about 1590. He was a weaver by trade, and came to this country and located at Gloucester, Massachusetts, where he was selectman in 1646, 1652 and 1654. At a court in Salem he took the freeman's oath, June 29, 1692, and was chosen clerk of the band, constable, and clerk of the market. His wife did not come to this country. In 1658 he sold lands at Gloucester and removed to Boston, where on the 16th of March, 1658-9 he purchased land, a small lot, about twenty-six by forty-six feet. It was located in what is now the centre of the post-office building, facing on Devonshire street. The famous old spring, which gave the name to Spring Lane and which is now preserved under the post-office, was near. This Avery plot was a part of, or at least adjoined, the site of two notable resorts of later days--the well known restaurant whence first came the famous "Julien soup", and the "Stackpole House," not much less famous. The Winthrop estate was not far away, and near by , in after years, Benjamin Franklin was born. Christoper Avery did not long retain this property, for March 22, 1663, he sold land to Ambrose Dew, for forty pounds. There had evidently been no increase of value in the five years that he had held possession. After being owned by two or three different persons, it was bought by Mr. Stackpole about 1790. Christopher Avery now followed his son James to Connecticut, and August 8 1665, purchased a house, orchard and lot of Robert Burrows in New London. Here he claimed exemption from watching and training, on account of age, in June 1667, and was made freeman of the colony October, 1669. He died March 12, 1670, by Minor diary.<br>
