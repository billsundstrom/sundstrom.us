Some of the workers at the 7UP company came out to see what all the commotion was about. One of the workers was Norman Paul Backes.

She received $500 in compensation from American Ferment for her injury. After her recovery, Gladys returned to American Ferment, but was fired after she was overheard telling a woman she worked with that she was looking for a better job. Mr. Cummings was the one who fired her.<br>
