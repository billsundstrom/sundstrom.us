QUEIROLO, Margaret Born Margaret Hussa in Cedarville, Calif., on April 25, 1917, she lived in Cedarville during her youth and had many fond memories of riding up and down the Surprise Valley with her father in his horse drawn butcher wagon. She graduated from Surprise Valley High School in a class of 12. She left Cedarville to live with two of her friends from Cedarville who had come to Sacramento and attended Heald's Business College. After graduating from Heald's, she worked for the State of California. One of her positions was working for the California Department of Employment as a file clerk and various other clerical positions. Her work with the State left a lasting impression upon her, as she noted to one of her sons thirty years after leaving state service that, "I still have nightmares sometimes about files that I can't find." She married Francis August Queirolo of Sacramento in 1942. When Francis returned from World War II, she left her State job to become a fulltime homemaker with the birth of her daughter Judy. She lived for fifty years at 2714 S Street in Sacramento's Midtown neighborhood. As her health declined, she moved into Trinity House Assisted Living and Mercy McMahon. As a homemaker, she was actively involved in community events at the Newton Booth School. She and Francis were active members of Tehas Dance Club. She worked as a volunteer receptionist at St. Francis Church Rectory and was also active in the Mercy General Hospital Guild. She developed a passion for golf, and was a member of the Cordova Couple's Club and Haggin Oaks Niners. She was preceded in death by her husband Francis Queirolo, her parents Walter and Elizabeth Hussa of Cedarville, and her brother, Walter Hussa of Cedarville. She is lovingly survived by her children Judith Tillinghast of Lodi, James Queirolo of Sacramento, and Gary Queirolo of Pacifica, as well as her grandchildren Shawn Tienken of Redwood City, Shannon Scott of Lodi, and Jovel Queirolo of Pacifica. Private Interment Services will be held at St. Mary's Cemetery under the direction of the GEORGE L. KLUMPP CHAPEL OF FLOWERS.<br>

Walter Oscar HUSSA
<p>
<a name ="I006848"><b>[I006848]</b></a><br />
Memorial services were held Sunday, Oct. 24, at St. James Catholic Church for Walter Oscar Hussa, 89, who passed away Thursday, Oct. 21, 2004 at the Surprise Valley Hospital in Cedarville.<br>
Hussa, a Surprise Valley native, born to W.H. and Elizabeth Donnelly Hussa on April 28, 1915 in Cedarville, was second in a family of three children: the eldest, Frances, died in infancy; Walter; and Margaret Hussa Queirolo of Sacramento.<br>
On Nov. 9, 1938, Hussa and Katherine Gooch, also a native of Surprise Valley, were married in Los Angeles and returned to Cedarville to make their home.<br>
To this union was born son, John, and daughter, Nancy.<br>
Hussa entered the butcher trade after graduating from Surprise Valley High School and completing two years of study at Herald Business College in Sacramento. He continued working alongside his father W. H. Hussa in the plant and behind the retail counter. Years earlier, the company had expanded the retail meat trade with shops in Ft. Bidwell and Alturas, and into cattle ranching as well. Alkali Cattle Company, comprised of P. B. Harris, Lee Heryford and W.H. Hussa, trailed its cattle 60 miles east to summer pasture on Badger Mountain and the surrounding country in Nevada. Alkali Cattle Company held a grazing permit on Sheldon Antelope Range from 1938 until the mid 1980s. The cattle wintered on the home ranches in Surprise Valley.<br>
Hussa was a member of the Cedarville Fire Department for 68 years, a volunteer department founded by his father. He was a charter member of the Surprise Valley Rotary club and honored as a Paul Harris Fellow for active service.  In 1998, he was awarded a jacket and a pin for 60 years of service, and in 2004 Hussa completed his 66th year as a Rotarian. He served the community and region in many capacities and was a member of the school board; Modoc County Cattleman's Association; Modoc County Bull Sale Committee; and the BLM Stewardship Committee. Hussa was also a member and director of the Lassen Production Credit Association, a past president of the North Cal-Neva Resource Conservation District, was a director of the Vya Soil Conservation District, and Federal Land Bank. He gained a life membership into the Society of Range Management and was named Rangeman of the Year.<br>
Older residents of Surprise Valley will remember Hussa playing saxophone and clarinet for local dances and cooking at various community and FFA barbecues for many years.<br>
His beloved wife, Kay, preceded Hussa in death. Surviving are his son John and daughter-in-law Linda of Cedarville; daughter Nancy Bean of Fort Langley, Canada: granddaughter Lynne "Katie" Tims, Cleveland, Miss.; grandsons Michael and Jonathan Bean; great-grandson Nicholas Tims; sister Margaret Queirolo of Sacramento, niece Judy, and nephews Jim and Gary Queirolo.<br>
Father Patrick Henry officiated at the memorial mass at St. James Church of the Sacred Heart Parish. Members of St. James Guild attended the service and served a potluck lunch.<br>

Memories of Walt Hussa by Ron Morgan<br>
I worked in a grocery store, Lowell and Williams, in Alturas in the late thirties, before and after school and all day Saturday. This grocery store also had a meat market within the store. The store was owned by Walter Hussa and was managed by Arthadeus Rachford.<br>
Walt would make about two trips per week from Cedarville to Alturas to keep the store stocked with meat and to assist Mr. Rachford with cutting, packaging and grinding meat for sale. One day he was grinding up a big batch of hamburger meat when he let out quite a howl. Somehow he got his thumb caught in the grinder and of course lost that thumb. To this day I often wonder whether that particular batch of ground beef was sold or thrown out. Money was pretty hard to come by then.<br>
Walt was a large person, not only in size but in personality and capability. I used to think that he was pretty old, but he was only a few years older than I. Perspective is often non-existent when you are young.<br>
In 1937, Alturas suffered a flood. I hooked a ride in a row boat to the Lowell and Williams store and started the clean up with the rest of the employees. When it came time for lunch, nobody had anything prepared. We helped ourselves to some salami from the meat market and bread and mayonnaise from the store and the eight of us, that were there, had quite a feast on Salami sandwiches. I remember Arthadeus trying to explain to Walt that he had no idea what happened to all of the salami that had been stocked in that meat case.<br>
Those were the days that when you accompanied your mom to the meat market you were always given a wiener to eat by the butcher. Also, in those days, beef liver was given to customers, requesting it, for their dogs. A loaf of bread cost a dime, a quart of milk cost a dime, and you could get a Polly Ann Bakery berry pie for 35 cents. On special occasions my lunch consisted of a whole berry pie and a quart of milk. When I spent my money for that lunch, I only earned a nickel for my days work. It was a different time then with different values.<br>
