Charles William Berry, who was, for many years, in charge of thermodynamics instruction, was born in Charleston, Massachusetts in 1872. He attended public schools in Somerville and graduated from the Institute Electrical Engineering Course in 1895. He was awarded the Swett Fellowship and studied for two years at Gottingen under Walter Nernst, the physical chemist, and Felix Klein, the mathematician.<br>
Returning to the Institute, Berry taught mathematics for some time, but in 1899, came to the Mechanical Engineering Department where he taught thermodynamics for the next forty years. He directed the Refrigeration Laboratory from 1916 until his retirement in 1940.<br>
Professor Berry introduced new subjects in Refrigeration, Heat Transmission, and Thermodynamics of Gas Mixtures. He was the author of a text on graphical thermodynamics, "The Temperature Entropy Diagram," and the inventor of the temperature-entropy indicator, a device which draws a chart showing the heat exchanges between the hot gases and the walls of an engine or cylinder. The indicator quickly produced results which would have taken hours of calculation by other methods. Berry also authored a book on "Problems of Heat Engineering".<br>

<p>
<a name ="I034139"><b>[I034139]</b></a><br />
Webb.-At her home, 3d ward of this city, Feb. 8, 1898, Mrs. DOUGLAS WEBB, aged 71 years 8 months and 16 days.<br>
Laura Debora Berry was born in Pompey, Onondaga county, N.Y., May 22, 1826. She was married to Douglas Webb in Hastings, Oswego county, N.Y., Oct 16, 1843. <br>
In the spring of 1844 Mr.& Mrs. Webb removed from their native state to Wisconsin. They located in Waukesha county, where they remained one year. <br>
In May, 1845, they settled upon a farm in the north-west part of Lowell township, Dodge county, Wis. This was their home until 1884 when the farm was sold and they came to this city, where they have since resided.<br>
Mrs. Webb was an earnest, conscientious woman, who exerted an influence for good upon all with whom she associated. <br>
She knew the hardships of pioneer life in Wisconsin, and struggled against poor health the most of her life, but was always deeply interested in the welfare of her neighbors and the good of society. Her sympathies were especially enlisted in religious and temperance work, and their kindred interests. <br>
By forming new acquaintances and acquiring new interests she never lost her concern for the old friends and neighbors of the community where she resided so many years.<br>
Her parents dying while she was quite young, she was raised in the home of devoted grandparents. From the life and teaching of her grandfather Curtiss, she received impressions that had a marked influence on all the years of her life. She was ever fond of dwelling on his wise words and pure example.<br>
During the last fourteen years of her life she was connected with the Free Methodist church of this city. <br>
She leaves her husband, five children and a number of grandchildren to mourn their loss. <br>
Her first child died in its fifth year while the parents were on a visit to their native state. <br>
The living children are Mrs. Martha M. Taylor, of this city, Charles C. Webb, of Fox Lake, Rev. Lynn B. Webb, of Evansville, and Mrs. Minnie M Hughes and Willard B. Webb, of Beaver Dam. <br>
Mrs. Webb endured great physical suffering from a combination of diseases for several years. Consumption of the bowels is supposed to have finally caused her death.<br>
Thus has passed to her eternal home a truly good woman, whose good works to Dodge county for over half a century, have endeared her to a host of warm friends. <br>
The funeral occurred to-day.<br>
