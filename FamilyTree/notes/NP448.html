She is the mother of Nicole (Greg) Kellar and Steven (Katherine Pittman) Reppe and the proud grandmother of four.

Betty started employment at Wight, Comes & Sogn Funeral Chapel in October of 2005 as a management assistant and is very efficient in organizing and helping the office run smoothly.  This includes: writing or helping  family with  the obituary, preparing the beautiful memorial folders, scanning/cropping photos, calling the appropriate people involved with the funeral such as the pastor, organist, soloist and pallbearers and making the preparations of such as easy and comforting for the family as possible.  Other necessary calls are to insurance companies for families, ordering caskets and vaults, and various other clerical and physical duties deemed as to what the needs are.  <br>

Volsung RERSSON
<p>
<a name ="I008199"><b>[I008199]</b></a><br />
From Wikipedia<br>
<br>
In Norse mythology, Volsung was the father of Sigmund. He was murdered by the Geatish king Siggeir.<br>
<br>
Ironically, in Beowulf, when the Geatish warrior Beowulf has killed Grendel, a Danish bard at Hrothgar's court sings about Sigmund and his father Waels.<br>
<br>
Synopsis<br>
<br>
Völsung was the great-grandson of Odin himself, and it was Odin who made sure that Völsung would be born. Völsung's parents who were the king and queen of the Huns could not have any children until Odin and his consort Frigg sent them a giantess named Ljod carrying the apple of fertility. Völsung's father died shortly after this but his wife was pregnant for six years, until she had had enough. She commanded that the child be delivered with a caesarian, an operation that in those days cost the life of the mother. Völsung was a strong child and he kissed his mother before she died.<br>
<br>
He was immediately proclaimed king of the Huns and when he had grown up he married the giantess Ljod. First they had two twins, the girl Signy and her twin brother named Sigmund. After the twins they had nine more sons.<br>
<br>
Völsung built himself a great hall in the centre of which stood a large apple tree. Siggeir, the King of the Geats, soon arrived and proposed to Signy. Both Völsung and his sons approved, but Signy was less enthusiastic.<br>
<br>
A great wedding was held in the hall, when suddenly a stranger appeared. He was a tall old man with only one eye. He went to the apple tree took his sword and stuck it deep into the trunk. Odin told everyone that the sword was meant for the man who could pull the sword from the apple tree. Then he vanished.<br>
<br>
Everyone at the wedding tried to pull the sword but only Sigmund succeeded, and he did so effortlessly. The sword was named Gram and it proved to be an excellent weapon. Siggeir, his father-in-law, offered thrice its weight in gold for the sword, but Sigmund scornfully said no. This greatly angered Siggeir who returned home the next day.<br>
<br>
Three months later, Völsung and his sons were invited to banquet with Siggeir. They were met by Signy who warned them that Siggeir intended to ambush them. They refused to turn back whereupon Signy cried and implored them to go home. Soon they were attacked by the Geats, Völsung fell and his ten sons were taken captive.<br>

Mary Gertrude REWA
<p>
<a name ="I019296"><b>[I019296]</b></a><br />
At eighty-five (sheʼll be eighty-six Feb. 4th) she has limited mobility. She can use a walker for short distances, but other than that - sheʼs either in a wheel chair or her recliner-type chair that elevates at the seat, to help her get up. Her hands are starting to show signs of arthritis and her eye sight is growing dim, yet, even though her body is aging, sheʼs still a wide-eyed-child when it comes to her soul.<br>
With over a hundred and some ought grand-kids she manages to keep track of them all. And all year she sits and knits, spins and weaves some kind of Christmas magic into hats and scarves and baby blankets. And somehow, at Christmas, without even leaving her chair, she manages to have gifts for everyone. She has spent more time making gifts for others than many folks have been alive. She MUST be Mrs. Claus - or related in some kind-of-way, right?<br>
She watches, too. With dimming eyes and one finger at a time she taps at a lap top and - like a mother-hen - she watches her brood banter on face-book.  <br>
Although confined physically, sheʼs a world traveler in her soul. Sit by her side and sheʼll take you places decades from here, with her stories. Like the first time she met the love of her life at Coney Island: Santa. No, just kidding - Henry Joseph DeVlaeminck. Sheʼll walk you through the depression and wade through life on a pig farm. Youʼll ride her words to school with horse and sleigh. Sheʼll tell of the trials and laughter of raising fourteen children - the birth of someand the loss of others. <br>
With a twinkle in her eye and a never fading smile, sheʼll tell of how she saw Jesus in a dream and how she prays for others.<br>
Her house in nothing fancy, but her Home is a mansion. Each day her house fills with family, including ex-husbands, ex-wives, ex-this and ex-that, once in you're IN. Iʼve said itʼs easier to get out of the mob than out of this family.  Sheʼs soft spoken, just above a whisper, but she can move an army of adoring children with a simple word.<br>
Maybe my mother-in-law isnʼt related in any way to Santa. BUT - she IS related to the Greatest Gift Giver of all. And she works for Him. And, maybe her family isnʼt anything like being in the mob with the Godfather and all that stuff. BUT - she is tight with God The Father.<br>
And I am honored to share her with you today. Her kids call her Ma, but everyone else - whether related or not - calls her Gramma Mary. So, if you need a family, you can join ours.<br>
Thanks for stopping by and as Gramma Mary would say; "Gramma misses you, come back and see me again."<br>
If you think you donʼt have a family or a parent to honor - think again, you do.<br>
