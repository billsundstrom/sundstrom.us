John Dean RANDALL
<p>
<a name ="I064428"><b>[I064428]</b></a><br />
JOHN D. RANDALL, now living a retired life in Aurora, has been a resident of Kane county, since June, 1843. He traces his ancestry back to John Randall, who came from England in 1630, locating in Connecticut, where some of the family have always remained. The great-great grandfather of our subject was also named John Randall. His son, Col. William Randall, was in command of a regiment, during the war of 1812, and at Stonington, defended the town and beat off the British. His son, Jedediah Randall, was born in Stonington, New London county, Connecticut, and was the father of our subject. Jedediah Randall married Philura Peckham, of North Stonington, and a daughter of Squire Thomas Peckham of that place. After their marriage they remained for some years in Connecticut, and in 1843, came to Kane county, Illinois, where he purchased a partially improved farm, of one hundred and twenty acres, in Sugar Grove township. After further improving the place, some eight years later he sold and moved to Aurora, but died on a farm near that city in 1860, at the age of sixty years.<br>
Jedediah and Philura Randall were the parents of seven children, who grew to manhood and womanhood - John, our subject; Russell, now in the real-estate business in Georgia; James, for some years an active business man at Batavia and Aurora, was killed by an accident in his stone quarry; Mary A., married Peleg Winslow, and they located in Hinckley, where she died; Dudley was a printer by trade, and died in St. Louis; Cyrus was a soldier in the war for the union, and died in Andersonville prison; and Roswell, who died at the age of eight years.<br>
John D. Randall was born in the town of Stonington, New London county, Connecticut, August 9, 1823, and his boyhood and youth were spent in his native state, where he was reared to farm life, and in its common schools procured a fair education. He was twenty years old when the family came to Kane county, and for several years remained with his father assisting him in farm work. In 1851, he purchased two tracts of government land, lying near Waterman, Illinois, each containing one hundred and sixty acres. He located upon one quarter, and commenced its improvement, and there resided for three years. Renting that farm, he built a residence and moved to the other tract. In 1855 he sold out and returned to Kane county, buying residence property in Aurora. In the fall of the same year he sold his residence property and purchased a farm of three hundred and twenty acres, lying near the city, to which he removed and there engaged in farming for some years. He later sold one-half of the farm and yet retains one hundred and sixty acres, just outside the city limits, and which is a well improved and valuable farm.<br>
In 1851 Mr. Randall was married, in Kane county, to Maria L. Barnes, a native of New York, born in the town of Alexander, Jefferson county, where she remained until the age of fifteen years, when she came with her father, Ira Barnes, to Kane county. This was in 1845, her father being numbered among the early settlers of Sugar Grove township. By this union were three children. Frank grew to mature years. He was a natural mechanic, and invented acorn harvester, which he later sold to William Deering, of Chicago. He died in 1882, leaving a wife and three children. Martha grew to womanhood and married Oscar E. Marlette, a farmer of Kane county. Lew Wallace is married and carries on the home farm.<br>
In 1888 Mr. Randall purchased a lot at No. 18 North Chestnut street, where he built a neat residence, and where he has since continued to reside. He has always been an active and enterprising man, and in 1884 was elected highway commissioner of Aurora township, and served three years, during which time the roads through the township were graveled, and the New York street and North avenue bridges were built, important and much needed improvements. While residing in Waterman, he was elected and served two years as assessor, and was also justice of the peace for two years, resigning the latter office when he returned to Kane county. He was also township trustee a number of years, and assisted in the organization of the school districts of his township. Being a firm believer in prohibition, for some years he has been identified with the Prohibition party, but formerly was a Republican. When he came to Kane county, there was not a railroad anywhere in the vicinity, and the country was but little better than a wilderness. He has lived to see it thickly populated, having within its borders many, thriving towns, while its farms are the most productive in the country.<br>
