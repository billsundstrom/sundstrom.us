Levi CHAMBERLAIN
<p>
<a name ="I006037"><b>[I006037]</b></a><br />
Mr. Chamberlain was born in Dover, Vermont, Aug. 28, 1792, and died aged fifty-seven years. His early life was spent with an uncle in Boston, Mass., by whom he was trained to the mercantile business. When of age he began this sort of work for himself with such success as to have the almost certain prospect of accumulating wealth. He became a member of the Park Street Church in 1818 and his heart was ever afterward drawn toward the gospel ministry. After consulting with judicious friends he gave up his mercantile business and commenced a preparatory course of study in the academy in Andover, Mass., for the ministry. Indications of the disease that ultimately proved fatal, along with the exigency of the missionary work, led to a change in his life plan. Placing his little property where its avails would help forward the cause of missions, he accepted an invitation' to join the first reinforcement of the mission to the Hawaiian Islands and arrived in Honolulu April 27, 1823. He entered upon his new labors with a self-devotion, which never wavered. He brought to his work a vigorous mind, a sagacious judgment, a body, though frail, exceedingly active and efficient, and a spirit supremely de- voted to his Redeemer and the good of his fellow men. His toils were incessant and perplexing, but he shrank from no sacrifice, no self-denial. He was ready to take the lowest place, the poorest fare, the hardest toil; ready to be a hewer of wood and drawer of water in building the temple of the Lord on those then heathen islands. The range of his mind was by no means restricted to the secular concerns of the mission. His correspondence with his brethren of the mission and his patrons at home touched on almost every vital interest, and was truly wonderful in its quantity, its matter and the neatness and accuracy of its execution. Long and wearisome days he devoted to the examination of native schools, and being himself proficient in penmanship he took pleasure in imparting the art to the more advanced of the native pupils. Mr. Chamberlain's experience, judgment and piety gave him influence with his brethren as a counselor. He leaned to the side of self-denial, prudence and caution. His opinions were frankly and kindly expressed. The Hawaiian Mission suffered a great loss on July 29, 1849, by the death of Levi Chamberlain who, for twenty-six years was the senior superintendent of its secular affairs. Probably no man has lived on those islands who was more generally respected and beloved. As a husband, as a father, as an agent entrusted with great responsibilities, as a member of the mission and the foreign community he was the same conscientious, devoted Christian. <br>

Warren Chamberlain died at the home of his son W. W. Chamberlain, on Dec. 9, 1914, aged eighty-five years, and his body was laid to rest in Kawaiahao cemetery after a beautiful service conducted by Rev. A. A. Ebersole in the old stone church.<br>
Warren Chamberlain was born July 17, 1829, in a grass house in Honolulu, and in April of 1832 moved with his parents into the large coral house now called the Chamberlain House.  He was the eldest son of Levi Chamberlain, Secular Agent of the Hawaiian Mission, and in 1836, at the age of seven years, he and a younger brother were sent in a whaling ship around Cape Horn to New London, Conn. in 1841 he entered Williston Seminary, East Hampton, at it commencement, which school he attended for some years. Probably early approaching deafness influenced him in the choice of a course in agriculture, and he returned to Hawaii in 1850 an educated farmer.  He bought land in Waialua and engaged in agriculture and grazing till 1867, being the pioneer sugar planter there,  After leaving Waialua he was Superintendent of Grounds at Punahou, taking charge of the boys in their outdoor lessons, as Mr. Rice, his predecessor, had done.  In 1870 he entered the Statistical Bureau of the Custom House in Honolulu, where he served faithfully for thirty years, retiring in 1900, at the age of seventy-one years.<br>
He was married in 1854 to Miss Celia P. Wright, a devoted wife who preceded him to the better land in 1907.  He was a good husband, a kind and loving father and a true unselfish friend.  He was a charter member of the 2nd Foreign Church, afterward called Fort St. Church, organized in 1851, and in 1866 was one of a committee of five to petition for a charter for Central Union Church.  He was one of the original members of the Cousinsʼ Society, contributed to the Mail Wreath, and in his eighty-first year wrote for the Annual Report of 1910 a very valuable paper entitled, "Incidents and remembrances connect with the Chamberlain House." <br>

From James Baldwin Parker, 19 October 2002<br>
<br>
William Warren Chamberlain, b. 13 Feb 1873, Honolulu, Hawaii, m. Clio Newton there, 21 Feb, 1906, with three children listed for them: Warren Levi, Clio Olivia, and Althea Mabel. I don't have any more data for him or his children, but if he lived in Maui after his marriage, you should be able to locate him there in the 1910 Census. His ancestors did indeed live in Maui. William is one of 5 children of Warren Chamberlain, who married Celia Penninah Wright, 2 Apr 1854. Warren was born 17 Jul 1829, Kawaiaho, Hawaii, and died 8 Dec 1914; Celia was born 12 May 1831 and died 1 Feb 1907. My records indicate that Warren Chamberlain was member #212 of the original Chamberlain Association of America. His letter, dated 15 Aug 1901, from Honolulu, was sent to the CAA and was published in its 1902 Annual Report, pp. 11-12, telling of his activities. CAA arcives indicate that Warren's father, Levi Chamberlain, with a small group from Maine, including Chamberlains and Whitneys, went to Hawaii and founded a missionary school there. Levi was married 1 Sep 1818 in Lahaini, Maui, Hawaii, and died there 29 Jul 1849.  Ancestral line of descent: Levi(6), Joseph(5), Willson(4), John(3), Jacob(2), William(1) Chamberlain of Billerica, MA.<br>

O. Smith, then actively engaged with a large private law practice. Mr. Smith had a rapidly expanding trust business, which was entrusted to the manager-ship of Mr. Chamberlain until 1911, when it was incorporated as the Guardian Trust Co., Ltd., and Mr. Chamberlain was named manager. In 1920 this trust company was amalgamated with the Bishop Trust Co., Ltd., and since that time Mr. Chamberlain has been a director and a member of the executive committee of the latter corporation.<br>
