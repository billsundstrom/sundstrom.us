The picture of Arthur McCann in Lowell, MA, leads me suspect that Thomas might have had a brother in Lowell.  There is one in 1860 census with a 10 year old son, Arthur.  When we unearth the Irish records this will be something to look for.<br>
<br>
The naturalization paper of Thomas McCann states his origin as Magheracross which is a civil parish  partly in  the Barony of Omagh, County of Tyrone and partly in the Barony of Lurg, County of Fermanaugh.  <br>

McCarthy, who died on Sunday February 9th in his Beachmont home, with his loving family by his side after a most courageous battle with Pancreatic Cancer, he was 54 years old. Tom had a final request, that all of his friends & family who attend his visitation, please be dressed casually, wear a Boston Sports Team T- Shirt or that of a favorite Band T-shirt. Interment will be private.<br>
Tom was a very proud lifelong resident of the Beachmont section in Revere. He was an alumnus of Revere High School, Class of 1983. He married Anne (Sciarappa) on April 1st, 1990. Later this year, they would have celebrated their 30th wedding anniversary. They remained in Revere, where they raised their two daughters, Teresa & Amanda.  Tom worked as a Group Leader in the Printing Division for Massachusetts Medical Society, a position he held for over 31 years until his health declined. Anyone who knew Tom, knew that he was more than just a Boston Sports Fan, he was unequivocally an enthusiast & collector. Tom loved his Boston Sports Teams, but the Patriots & Red Sox were his favorites. Although, he did very much enjoy watching the Celtics during the Larry Bird Era. Tom was a very humble man who was dedicated to his family. He was a modest man, and even at this time of sorrow, he wouldnʼt want people mourning him, but to be celebrating his life with memories & a toast or two.<br>
He is the devoted husband of Anne T. (Sciarappa) McCarthy of Revere. Proud & loving father of Teresa A. McCarthy - OʼHara & husband Revere Police Officer Kevin OʼHara of Beverly & Amanda M.

<a name ="I023483"><b>[I023483]</b></a><br />
Calvin Reeves McCaull was born November 25, 1889 in Ellerslie, Prince Edward Island. Bound for adventure, Mac arrived in the valley in 1911 at the age of 22. A few years later, he met and courted Janet Lavina Soles and they were married in 1920.<br>

Clarabell Charlotte MCCAULL
<p>
<a name ="I023460"><b>[I023460]</b></a><br />
Clara Benson passed away peacefully with family by her side on Monday March 14, 2016 at the age of 83.<br>
Clara was born on November 7, 1932 in Parson BC. Clara was the sixth child of Janet and Calvin McCaull. She grew up on the family farm in Parson with six sisters and one brother surrounded by a very large extended family.<br>
Clara met Garth Benson in the early 1950's; they married on June 18, 1955. They moved frequently between Creston and Golden. They moved back to the valley in 1965. After living in town for many years Clara and Garth moved to a piece of property, it is bordered by the Blaeberry and Columbia Rivers. This "piece of heaven that my husband made for me" as she described it, became a place where family and friends were welcomed with Claraʼs particular brand of hospitality.<br>
Claraʼs world revolved around her family, both immediate and extended. For those that knew and loved her there is a familiar theme of memories of what she loved: cooking, playing cards, camping, fishing and picking berries, gardening and her personal relationships with cows and a goose named 'Honk'. Clara was never too busy to listen, to make people laugh with her quick wit. People of all ages and backgrounds enjoyed spending time with her.<br>
Clara cherished her children, grandchildren, and great grandchildren. Clara was predeceased by Garth on January 17, 2013. They enjoyed 57 years together. Clara will be lovingly remembered and deeply missed by her children Mark, Leonard, Susan, and Penny (Keith), grandchildren, and great grandchildren.<br>
At a later date, Clara's wishes for her and Garth's cremated remains to be spread together on the farm will be honoured.<br>
