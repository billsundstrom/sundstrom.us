About 11:30 o'clock his son Harry heard him breathing heavily, and, accompanied by Mrs. Van Dyke, went to his bed and tried to arouse him, but Mr. Van Dyke passed away in a few moments.

Besides the bereaved widow, four children, Jesse, of Chicago, Leslie, of New Richmond, Wis., and Harry and Genevieve, residing at home, are left to mourn his departure.<br>
The funeral was held from the late home in Pequaming, Friday morning at 8 o'clock, Rev. Horace N. Aldrich, pastor of the M. E. church, conducting the service, and also accompanied the family to Ishpeming, where the burial took place.<br>
