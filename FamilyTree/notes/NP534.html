---------------------------------<br>
Biography:<br>
If anyone ever cared, really cared for someone else it would have to be Vicki Lynn Switzer. She was a warm hearted and well liked individual, and these wonderful traits came easily to her because she was such a sociable and amiable person, someone who was always making certain that those around her had whatever they needed. Vicki was a talkative person who was tactful at all times but typically said what she meant.<br>
Vicki was born in Union Hospital in Terra Haute, Indiana. She was the daughter of Earl and Norma Switzer. Vicki was raised in Terra Haute, Indiana. During her childhood she learned to be reliable and respectful. Vicki was an obedient child who wanted to win the favor of others. She found it easy to show sympathy and to perform kind acts for others. These admirable qualities would become a part of Vicki's personality throughout her life.<br>
Though Vicki was frequently the one to initiate games and activities with her family, she was also quite often the family member who took the role of referee. Vicki was a peace-maker with an ability to resolve all sorts of family conflicts. In fact, Vicki worked conscientiously to keep those typical family spats at bay. Vicki was raised with eight siblings. She had two younger brothers, Steve and Brandon, and six younger sisters, Debbie, Kelley, Kathy, Linda, Tammy and Jennifer. Vicki and her siblings had the typical rivalries while growing up, but they cared deeply for one another.<br>
As someone who reveled in the sheer joy of her experiences, Vicki was always enthusiastic about new adventures. Although she had an exacting nature, Vicki was always tactful. One thing Vicki will certainly be remembered for is that, when she got up in the mornings, she was ready and raring to go. As a young girl, Vicki had a number of interests and was an active child. Vicki took part in racquet ball and horseback riding. She was a Job's Daughters. In her spare time she liked to read. Vicki's memorable achievements included academic excellence.<br>
For Vicki, the school routines were never a problem although she generally preferred variety to structure. She seemed to be able to start a project and work right through to its completion. And she was able to do it quickly and efficiently. Vicki was also adept at details. Vicki was very observant and was generally quick at picking up new things. She graduated from West Vigo High School in 1972. She enjoyed some courses more than others, having favorite classes and teachers. Her favorite class in high school was literature. The teacher she enjoyed learning from the most was Miss Russell. Her accomplishments included class president, glee club and booster block.<br>
College can be a challenge, but Vicki appeared to be well equipped to succeed. She had a knack for staying focused and on track no matter what was going on around her. Vicki had the ability to work undisturbed through all of the constant interruptions that are a regular part of college life. Vicki enjoyed using the skills she'd already learned and applying them to new courses. She knew the facts and rarely made factual errors. She earned her Bachelors of Education from University of Nevada Las Vegas. She also pursued graduate school, earning her Masters of Education in Library Science from UNLV. Her favorite course was Literature. Her favorite professor was Grandpa Doug.<br>
There was one thing that all of Vicki's friends knew and will still remember, and that is that she was a talker. She could pretty much talk to anybody about anything. This quality is one of the primary reasons that Vicki was such a popular person throughout her life. But Vicki was also dependable, loyal and trustworthy. Vicki was the kind of person who simply radiated good fellowship. While she maintained personal standards and her own personal values, Vicki was very accepting of others. With a distinct skill for working things out, Vicki was often the person who would organize events. In fact, Vicki was fairly comfortable playing the role of "host" for just about any occasion. When Vicki made friends, she made true and lasting friendships. While growing up, some of her best friends were Kim Step, Diane Petrie, Laura Fava and Mary Krazak. Later in life, she became friends with Brenda Hirsh and Susan Slykerman.<br>
Harmony was important to Vicki and she made every effort to maintain it with her family. Vicki was blessed with two children, two daughters, Leilani and Cari, and also David and Maile . They were also blessed with seven grandchildren, Andrew, Alexandra, Emilie, Ayden, Declan, Davis and Callum. Vicki was always conscious of the feelings others had. She was reasonable and understanding. As a result, Vicki was quick to solve disputes and did so without much fuss.<br>
Taking her work seriously came naturally to Vicki, and she expected the same from those around her. Vicki was a good team player, someone who was born to cooperate with others. She was what some would call a "people person" and it was demonstrated in her good communication skills. Vicki was a steady worker, one who was realistic about schedules. The kind of details that would give family members and work colleagues fits were situations that Vicki handled well. She could understand the details without getting lost in the broad "big picture." Her primary occupation was an Educator. She was employed for 30 years with Clark County School District and Many years with DDC and nursing homes. She brought harmony to her work environment, doing what was necessary in order to get the job done, while always maintaining respect for her colleagues.<br>
A methodical woman, Vicki enjoyed spending time working on her various hobbies. She had no problem following all of the steps and instructions on a given project and was proud of the fact that she could have something to show for her efforts. Her favorite pursuits were book clubs, Bookinʼ Bikers, baking, party planning, spending time with her grandkids and traveling the world.<br>
Her keen interest in things that affected the lives of other people led Vicki to become actively involved in professional and community organizations. Because she was outgoing and worked well with others, Vicki did her fair share of volunteer work. And she wouldnʼt shy away from taking the lead on committees or events, either. She was a born list maker and was great at creating and sticking to schedules. In high school, Vicki was a member of the Glee club.<br>
Vicki was the kind of person who would readily move into action in order to help others. She was appreciated and respected. She could find value in the opinions of others and was passionate about her own values and beliefs. So itʼs little wonder that she was active and highly valued by those in her community, serving on committees for the ALA (American Library Association) and Bookinʼ Bikers.<br>
Her high moral standards and traditional values served Vicki well with her faith. Religion and faith were important to her. She was a Christian. She was well respected because she was such an outgoing individual who sought to help in any manner she could.<br>
Not only did Vicki enjoy traveling, but she also seemed to enjoy planning all of those trips and vacations. She was a facilitator who could easily make up a near perfect schedule of all of the things to do and see. She rarely tired of going back and revisiting her favorite places. Favorite vacations included Disneyland, the beach (anywhere); she also enjoyed traveling the world.<br>
Vicki was a fantastic conversationalist who could engage just about anyone in a discussion. And whenever she said something, she meant it. Vicki was a down to earth person, outgoing and gregarious. She was without question the type of person who enjoyed experiencing things first hand. She was practical and sensible, but what friends and family will remember her for most is the fact that she was so understanding and kind. Everyone whose life she touched will miss Vicki Lynn Switzer.<br>
