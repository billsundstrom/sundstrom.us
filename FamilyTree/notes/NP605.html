Byron L. Zotaley<br>
It is with much sadness that we announce the passing of Byron Zotaley. Among his innumerable awards and accolades, Byron was most proud to be the husband of Theresa (Cassady), father of Nicole Apple, Jason Zotaley and Krissy Sommerstad, father-in-law to Ryan Apple and Paul Sommerstad, and Papou to six grandsons: Sam, Jake and David Apple and Theo, Victor and Wally Sommerstad. Byron passed peacefully in the early morning of January 15, 2024, surrounded by his loving wife, children and niece, Dr. Deepi Kakani Cassady. For the past several years, Byron lived courageously with frontotemporal dementia (FTD). While the disease stole his love of practicing law, public speaking and driving classic cars, he retained his good humor. His love of family, faith, community and all things Greek were with him through his final days. He was 79.<br>
Byron was born on March 18, 1944, the only child of Leo Zotaley of Athens, Greece, and Tula (Koupis) Zotaley of Minneapolis. Raised in St. Louis Park, Byron graduated from St. Louis Park High School, the University of Minnesota, William Mitchell College of Law and obtained a Master's degree from the University of St. Thomas. A practicing attorney for more than four decades, Byron lived most of his life in Edina with beloved wife Theresa and their children. He was a lifelong member of St. Mary's Greek Orthodox Church where he was baptized, married the love of his life and witnessed the baptisms of his children and grandchildren. He proudly carried on his family's six-generation legacy in the church, where he served as parish council president for several years. He was also deeply involved in the Orthodox Christian Laity (OCL) and the American Hellenic Educational Progressive Association (AHEPA).<br>
Byron loved traveling and especially spending time with his wife and extended family in the Miami sunshine, where he and Theresa regularly escaped the frigid Minnesota winters.<br>
Byron was preceded in death by his parents. He is survived by his wife, children, grandchildren and many beloved cousins, nieces, nephews and friends.<br>
In 1961, Byron - then 17 years old - told The Minneapolis Star newspaper, "I always seem to see the bright side of things, and I hope I can always do that." His enduring optimism and resilience carried through to his final moments. May his memory be eternal.<br>

WINSTED, Conn., June 20 - Two teen-age youths described by residents of this quiet old factory town as well- liked and well-behaved apparently committed suicide together either Monday night or Tuesday morning.<br>
The police found the bodies of the two - Robert Edward Gilley, 19 years old, and Peter Fred Zuchegna, 17 - slumped in the front seat of a car parked in a secluded area at 8:18 A.M. Tuesday after a passer-by called the authorities.<br>
The police said a vacuum-cleaner hose had been placed over the exhaust pipe to carry carbon monoxide fumes into the car through a side window.<br>
The police also said a note was found inside the car, but they declined to disclose its contents.<br>
'Apparent Double Suicide'<br>
''We are treating it as an apparent double suicide at this time, pending further investigation,'' Sgt. Jerold Silverio of the Winsted police said.<br>
As he looked around the area where the car was found, Sergeant Silverio said he could recall no similar incident in his 20 years on the police force of this northwestern Connecticut town of 10,000 people.<br>
''So far we have nothing to indicate why they wanted to do something like this,'' he said. ''Whatever their reasons, they probably will be locked away forever.''<br>
The office of the Chief State Medical Examiner in Farmington said tests were under way to determine the time and the cause of the deaths. A Friend's Car.....<br>

Ruben Åström brewer and merchant Boden helped start the racetrack in Boden Membership dues Trotter Society in 1944 was $50 one-time fee and a tenth in the annual fee. A lot of money then, but spending has never frightened the true trotting enthusiasts. H. A. Lundström, Ruben Åström, Nils Eriksson, Jakob Nilsson, Henry Sundling, Sigurd Fabricius and John Rutqvist were just "real horsemen." The gang met in Vanhankaupunginlahti in January 1943, together with a number of like-minded, they started the Norrbotten racetrack and later Torpgärdans racetrack, which is now the Boden racetrack. Ruben married 1912-07-14 by Beda Sofia Jakobsson. They had 6 children. On 03-03-1916 the family moved to a home att Fagernäs in Boden.

<p>
<a name ="I014263"><b>[I014263]</b></a><br />
Johan Alfred Åström moved with his wife Manda to Bergnäset on the Lule älv riverbanks just opposite the town of Luleå in 1900. Alfred and Manda are considered to be the first permanent settlers in Bergnäset. In 1918 Johan Alfred became the skipper of the steam ferry "Trafik", taking people from Bergnäset to Luleå and vice versa, and the family moved from Bergnäset to the city. Alfred retired in 1935. His daughter Signe Matilda Åström b 1898 got married to Karl Verner Johansson in Luleå. Her brother Sten Napoleon Åström b 1908 was a rather talented tennis player, got married in 1941 and moved to Skellefteå in 1946. There he died in 1992.<br>
Sten Åström wrote a book about his parents, "Lilla Mandas vandring" (Lil' Manda's walk, meaning both foot walk and odyssey through life, I guess) It starts with the little girl's 15 mile footwalk with her father from Långnäs to Luleå and then tells the story of her life.<br>

Garcı́a ÍÑIGUEZ
<p>
<a name ="I030932"><b>[I030932]</b></a><br />
He was educated in Córdoba, as a guest at the court of the Emir of Córdoba. He was the son of Íñigo Arista, the first king of their dynasty. When his father was stricken by paralysis  in 842, he became regent of the kingdom (or perhaps co-regent with his uncle Fortún Íñiguez). He and his kinsman Musa ibn Musa ibn Fortún of the Banu Qasi rebelled against the Cordoban emir in 843. This rebellion was put down by Emir Abd-ar-Rahman II, who attacked the Kingdom of Pamplona, defeating Garcı́a badly and killing Fortún. At his father's death in 851/2, he succeeded to the crown.<br>
Following the death of Íñigo Arista, the Banu Qasi leader Musa ibn Musa pursued a policy of closer allegiance with Muhammad I of Córdoba, leaving Garcı́a to look to Christian Asturias for an ally. In 859, Musa ibn Musa allowed a contingent of Vikings to pass through his lands and attack Navarre, resulting in the capture Garcı́a, who was forced to pay at least 70,000 gold dinars in ransom. Later the same year, Musa ibn Musa attacked the Pamplonese city of Albelda. Garcı́a and his new friend Ordoño I of Asturias together dealt Musa a crushing blow, killing, it is said, 10,000 of his magnates in the Battle of Albelda. This, in turn, provoked a Muslim response and the next year, 860, saw Garcı́a's son and heir Fortún captured and imprisoned by the Moors. He languished in Córdoba for the next 20 years. In 870, Garcı́a formed an alliance with the Muslim rebel Amrus ibn Amr ibn Amrus, who had killed Garcia's nephew Musa ibn Galindo of Huesca, and the next year was apparently in a new alliance with the sons of Musa ibn Musa, now in rebellion against Córdoba.<br>
Garcı́a I favoured the pilgrims who travelled to Santiago de Compostela, and attempted to guarantee peace for that traffic.<br>
Garcı́a's death has been subject to scholarly dispute, a result of a paucity of records from the last years of his reign. The lack of subsequent mention of him after 870 led to the suggestion that he died in that year, and as his heir was in the hands of his enemies, it was argued that Garcı́a Jiménez then governed the kingdom as regent. Garcı́a's son, Fortún Garcés, is then made to succeed upon his released in 880. There is, however, no evidence for such a regency, and Sanchéz Albornoz has cited evidence that Garcı́a was still living at the time of his son's return. Thus it is likely that Balparda was reporting accurate tradition when he suggested Garcı́a and ally Umar ibn Hafsun, fought a battle at Aybar against the troops of Emir of Córdoba in 882, Garcı́a dying there (although the age provided him, 84 years, is clearly exaggerated).<br>
The identity of Garcı́a's wife or wives is poorly documented, and has been subject to much speculation. An undated confirmation of an earlier lost charter refers to King Garcı́a and Queen Urraca Mayor, and this is thought by some to refer to Garcı́a Íñiguez and an otherwise unknown wife. Based on her name alone, it has been suggested that she was of the Banu Qasi, but other historians have given her different parentage, or even a different king as husband. Likewise, royal princess Leodegundia Ordoñez of Asturias, daughter of Ordoño I of Asturias, is known to have married a ruler of Pamplona, and Garcı́a Íñiguez is one of those speculated to have been this prince.<br>
Garcı́a Íñiguez had following children:<br>
    * Fortún Garcés, the future king.<br>
    * Sancho Garcés, whose only known child, Aznar Sánchez, married a daughter of king Fortún Garcés and by her had queens Toda Aznárez, wife of king Sancho Garcés I, and Sancha Aznárez, wife of king Jimeno Garcés.<br>
    * Onneca Garcés, wife of Aznar Galı́ndez II.<br>
    * Velasquita Garcés, married to Mutarrif ibn Musa ibn Qasi, Wali of Huesca, son of Musa ibn Musa.<br>
    * (perhaps) Jimena, wife of Alfonso III of León (assignment of her parentage based on political, chronological and onomastic arguments).<br>
