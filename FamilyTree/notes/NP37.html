Bert John BEXELL
<p>
<a name ="I053946"><b>[I053946]</b></a><br />
U.S. Veteran Bert John Bexell, 91, of Frankenmuth, Michigan, went home to be with the Lord on January 7, 2014. He left behind his beloved wife of more than 67 years, Mollie Elizabeth, and his three daughters, Karen (and Dennis) Smith, Christine (and Jack) Dalrymple, and Claudette (and Rick) Frame, as well as many nieces and nephews, grandchildren, great-grandchildren, and a great great-grandchild.<br>
An Army veteran of World War II, Bert was a talented cabinet-maker, born in Sweden, who worked beside his father for most of his life, creating beautiful furniture and helping develop the world-famous Cranbrook weaving loom. He and Mollie retired to Gaylord, Michigan, where they spent many years active in their community and church before moving to Frankenmuth. The friendships they forged through the years have stood the test of time.<br>
Bert was a man who lived what he believed. He loved his family and always put them first. He was honest, generous and kind. His life was full of love and laughter, hard work and integrity. But most of all his life was full of God's love and faithfulness, which attended him all of his days. It is this legacy that remains with those he left behind.<br>

Margaret Louise BEXELL
<p>
<a name ="I053947"><b>[I053947]</b></a><br />
Margaret Louise McClure, 86, passed away on the morning of Friday, March 11, 2011, in her home. Marge was born to John and Marie Bexell in 1924 in Cloquet, Minn.<br>
The daughter of Swedish immigrants, Marge enjoyed her Scandinavian heritage; its traditions, food and music were a defining part of her childhood. Her family moved to Pontiac, Mich., while she was a young girl, and she lived there until 1944 when she enlisted in the United States Army as a medical clerk.<br>
As World War II neared its end, she was a sergeant stationed at Fort Ord, Calif., - and it was there that she met and married Bob McClure. The two settled in the San Fernando Valley of Southern California where they raised five children and where Marge eventually returned to work as a medical records technician. When Bob retired from the aerospace industry, they felt the pull of the Northwest and moved to Post Falls in 1982. She especially liked camping and sight-seeing, and also loved to tend their yard and garden. Among her other hobbies were needlework, knitting and crafting.<br>
Marge valued duty and volunteerism, which was reflected in her service to the community. She and Bob worked with the Post Falls Food Bank; they also volunteered at the Post Falls library where they were among the founders of the Friends of the Library. The library's used-book store was probably her greatest source of community pride, and she enjoyed helping the library grow.<br>
Marge's first love was always her family. She is survived by her husband of 64 years, Bob McClure; daughter Kathy and her husband Mike of Shoreline, Wash.; daughter Robin and her husband Michael of Coeur d'Alene; son John and his wife Holly of Post Falls; daughter Ann Marie and her husband Gary of Loveland, Colo.; son Jim and his wife Debbie of Seattle, Wash.; and also 12 grandchildren and eight great-grandchildren.<br>
Marge was very much loved and respected by her family. Her generous spirit, sense of humor, compassion and genuine humility are already missed.<br>
