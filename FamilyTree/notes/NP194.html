George Mitchell FURNIVAL
<p>
<a name ="I035334"><b>[I035334]</b></a><br />
Dr. George Mitchell Furnival, BSc (University of Manitoba, 1929), MA (Queenʼs University, 1933), PhD (Massachusetts Institute of Technology, 1935) died on 29 July 2010 in Calgary Alberta at the age of 102. He was born in Winnipeg, Manitoba on 25 July 1908 to parents William George and Grace Una (Rothwell).<br>
For 9 years (1927-36) he was employed by the Government Department of Mines and by mining companies as a Field Geologist. He advanced to the position of Assistant Mine Superintendent for OʼBrien Mining (1936-39). During this period, he and his wife Marion lived in a log cabin near the mine close to Hawk Junction, Ontario. His first son was born in a Red Cross outpost and subsequently, mother and son were transported by dogsled back to the cabin. Following this period, he worked for the Geological Survey of Canada (1939-42) and published numerous technical papers and government reports on mining and petroleum fields including the Geological Survey of Canada Memoir 242 Cyprus Lake Map-Area, Saskatchewan, becoming a standard university reference text.<br>
For 28 years (1942-70) he served Standard Oil of California (Chevron). However, during 1946- 48, he was appointed Manitobaʼs Director of Mines and was granted leave of absence from Chevron. During this time he promulgated Manitobaʼs first comprehensive petroleum legislation for the exploration, production and conservation of oil and gas in Manitoba. He also developed a new geological concept for S.W. Manitoba based upon his knowledge of the geology found in the California Kemp No. 1 well, drilled in W. North Dakota in 1938. Chevron acquired permits, did seismic surveys and drilled its first well in 1950, which discovered the Daly Oilfield, the first commercial oil in Manitoba. Also in 1946 while Director of Mines of Manitoba, he founded the Manitoba Geological Survey, employing a staff of 6 geologists, for the first time on a permanent basis, to serve the mining, petroleum and industrial minerals industries of Manitoba. In 1947 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Canada.<br>
Following this leave of absence, he returned to Calgary to continue working for Standard Oil of California (Chevron). He worked with teams under his direction making significant petroleum discoveries in Alberta, Manitoba, Trinidad, and Columbia, while holding various positions including: from 1950-55 Vice President and Director of California Standard Alberta, and from 1952-60 President and Director of Dominion Oil Trinidad. In 1953 he conceived a new principle, ʻProgressive Displacementʼ, to explain the accumulation of oil and gas fields in sequential traps on the undip margins of basins, that occur in reverse order of their specific gravities. <br>
In 1955 he moved his residence to San Francisco, to take up the positions of Director and Vice President Exploration, Chevron Overseas Petroleum (San Francisco) from 1955-63, and Assistant, Land, to Vice President Exploration and Land, Standard Oil of California San Francisco from 1958-63. In 1963 he again moved his residence to take up his new position as Chairman and Managing Director of Western Australian Petroleum (WAPET Pty. Ltd.) in Perth W.A. for the period 1963-70. At the same time, inclusively, from 1953-70 (as Vice-President Exploration, and Director of various subsidiaries), he directed numerous offshore seismic and drilling programs in Trinidad, Bahamas, Guatemala, British Guyana, Cuba, Belize, Ecuador, Peru, and Australia. In 1965 WAPET announced the first commercial oilfield in Western Australia, located on Barrow Island 64 kilometers off Australiaʼs northwestern coast. Although Barrow Island consists of 214 desolate square kilometers in area, in 1908 it had been declared an A-Class reserve by the West Australian Government; a wildlife sanctuary status that only an Act of Parliament could disturb. Dr. Furnival was instrumental in preserving this wildlife sanctuary status during the exploration and full operation of the oilfields as described by W.H. Butler, one of Australiaʼs best-known naturalists, in an article The Lesson of Barrow Island published in the Australian Readerʼs Digest, August 1973 in which he describes "In an unusual conservation experiment, an oil company shows that industry and the natural environment can exist in harmony".<br>
 In 1971 Dr. Furnival returned to Calgary where he established a Consulting practice from 1971- 72. He then took up the positions of Vice President Operations Director for Brascan Resources in 1973, member of the Executive Committee as Senior Vice President in 1975, and also President and Director Coalition Mining, Senior Consultant in 1977. From 1978-80 while holding the position of President, CEO and Director, Western Mines, he developed a geological concept and initiated a program that led to the discovery of a major base metal/precious metal ore body at its Vancouver Island, Myra Falls Mine. He went on to become Executive Vice President, General Manager and Director, Westmin Resources from 1981-82, President and Director, Western Coal Holdings, and President, CO & Director, Lathwell Resources from 1983-85. In the following years (1985 - 2001) he continued as a Petroleum and Mining Consultant.<br>
 He has received many awards including the Distinguished Service Award in 1974 from the Petroleum Society, the Selwyn G. Blaylock Gold Medal in 1979 from the Canadian Institute of Mining and Metallurgy, the Order of Canada in 1982, the Centennial Award from the Association of Professional Engineers, Geologists and Geophysicists of Alberta in 1985, The Queen Elizabeth II Golden Jubilee Medal in 2002, and thee Alberta Centennial Medal in 2005. In addition to Fellow of the Royal Society of Canada since 1947, he is a Fellow of the Geological Association of Canada (FGAC), Geological Society of America (FGSA), and Society of Economic Geologists (FSEG). He is Honorary Life member of the Canadian Institute of Mining and Metallurgy where he served as Branch Chairman., District Councilor and Vice President, and Chairman of the Petroleum Division. He has been a member of the Engineering Institute of Canada, Alberta Association of Professional Engineers, Geologists and Geophysicists, American Association of Petroleum Geologists, and Australian Petroleum Exploration Association where he served as Past State Chairman and Member of the National Council.<br>
 A scholarship was established in his name in mining geology at U.B.C. Over the years he maintained his memberships in the Ranchmenʼs Club, Calgary Petroleum Club, and the Calgary Golf & Country Club.<br>
 George is predeceased by his wife, Marion Marguerite (Fraser). He is survived by his children: Capt. William George Fraser, Dr. Sharon Grace (Roscoe), Patricia Marion, LLB., and Bruce Alexander, M.Sc.; 6 grandchildren and 7 great grandchildren. He is greatly missed by all.<br>

William GAGER
<p>
<a name ="I010829"><b>[I010829]</b></a><br />
In the early spring of 1630, Dr. William Gager, along with his son John, began preparations to leave his ancestral home and medical practice to go to New England with the Massachusetts Bay Company. The voyage was to be under the leadership of his friend and neighbor, John Winthrop. They were to sail on the flagship ARABELLA, captained by one Peter Milborne and manned by fifty-two crewmen. The names of the other ships in the Winthrop fleet were: The JEWEL, The TALBOT, the CHARLES, the MAYFLOWER, the WILLIAM AND FRANCIS, the HOPEWELL, the WHALE, the SUCCESS, the TRAIL, and the AMBROSE. The ships were ready in the harbor and loaded with hogsheads of beer, water, "syder," vinegar, dried meat (16 hogsheads, and beef tongues. Some of the ships carried furniture, farm implements, and livestock. These were the ships that were to carry seven -hundred or so immigrants to the new world, to a new area, and to the religious freedom that these Puritans had not experienced in their homeland. Also, there was the promise of one hundred acres of free land to every man that signed on with the Massachusetts Bay Company.<br>
<br>
    Their departure was scheduled for Easter Monday, March 29, 1630, on the morning tide...[something about repair work, perhaps causing a delay]. On Tuesday, April 6th, Matthew Cradock, the late Governor of the Massachusetts Bay Company, arrived from London to take his official leave of the party. When this formality was over, he was duly saluted as he went over the side. Then the ships, led by the ARABELLA, weighed anchor and leisurely sailed down the Solent (a strait of the English Channel), and came to anchorage before the castle at Yarmouth, on the west end of the Isle of Wight. It was here that the Reverend John Cotton, Vicar of Boston in Lincolnshire, came down and gave his blessing and approval of the undertaking. He preached to them from the book of II Samuel, verse 7:10. Shortly after this farewell sermon, the flotilla was finally underway.<br>
<br>
    Winthrop writes in his journal that the weather was calm for the first few days and the passengers seemed to delight in what was a first of foremost of those on board. But the sea was soon to change, and with this many took to their bunks. So sick were many that they nearly died, and some did. Dr. Gager was obviously a busy man during this ordeal, but he too suffered from the malady for which the only cure is land.<br>
<br>
    Land was sighted on Friday June 11, 1630, after eighty-four days of turbulent seas. They dropped anchor the following day near Salem. The passengers were all dressed in their finest for the occasion. The ARABELLA fired two shots to alert those on shore of their arrival. The reverend George Phillips gave thanks unto the Lord for their safe journey. Many of the passengers were sick from scurvy, caused by their unwholesome diet at sea. Dr. Gager was among those so afflicted. But along with the warm winds of summer, many were to have their full strength restored.<br>
<br>
    Two years prior to this voyage, the Massachusetts Bay Company had sent John Endecott and a small company to prepare a place for the main arrival. Mr. Endecott said that several of his people were ill, and tired of eating mussels, berried, and indian corn. He also made it clear that many were anxious to return to England when the fleet departed.<br>
<br>
    After careful observation, Winthrop and his company decide not to settle at Salem. They went down the coast a few miles to a place that the Court of Assistants soon named Boston, after the place of the same name in Lincolnshire, England. The leaders of the colony soon erected a church, and on August 27, 1630, Dr. Gager and others signed the first Church covenant of Boston.<br>
<br>
    Dr. Gager and his son settled in Charlestown;, a section of the newly found Boston. While there, he was "Keeper of the Powder".<br>
<br>
    Dr. William Gager never fully recovered from the ill -effects of the voyage from England, and died of a fever on September 20, 1630.<br>
<br>
    William Gager's wife was Hannah Mayhew. She died in England, as did six of his other children. The deaths of these children are recorded in the Parish Records in Groton, England. Perhaps this great loss that he suffered was another reason for his departure from England. I can only assume that he thought things would be better in the New World.<br>
<br>
    According to records, William Gager's son, John Gager, seems to be the only other survivor of the Gager family that made the 1630 voyage. The following is from Dr. Snow's History of Boston printed in 1828: In the midst of these afflictions, Dr. Gager died. He was their principal, if not their only, physician and surgeon. He is represented as a man of skill in his profession, and we have seen that the soundness of his faith and the purity of his life had promoted him to the office of a deacon in the infant church. He was considered a public servant; and the same court which provided for the salaries of the ministers ordered that a household be built for him against the coming spring, and that he should be furnished with a cow and be paid twenty pounds for his first year, and afterwards have thirty pounds per annum at the common charge. Dr. Gager is buried at Town Hill, Charlestown, Massachusetts.<br>
