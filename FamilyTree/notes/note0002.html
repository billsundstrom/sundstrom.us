History of the Randall House<br />
Chapter Seven<br />
Graham Patriquin, 1932 - 1947<br />
 <br />
 <br />
1941 August 8:   The citizens of Wolfville were confronted with the proposed removal of the Thomas Andrew Strange DeWolfe house, an historical landmark which stood at the north-east corner of Main Street and gaspereau Extension. As a direct result of this proposal, the Wolfville Historical Society was organized. One of the organizers of the society was Rosamund DeWolfe Archibald, whose mother was a descendant of the original owner. The Society agreed to pay the Wolfville Fruit Company $20.80 a month to rent the house.<br />
 <br />
1942 November 4:   The DeWolfe house was opened as a tourists home and tea room. Mrs. R.S. Starr was curator and chatelaine of Wolfville's museum from 1942 to 1962.<br />
 <br />
1946:   The Wolfville Fruit Company claimed for tax purposes the property on which the DeWolfe house stood. While the house could have been moved to another site, the cost was prohibitive.<br />
      Charles A. Patriquin died 25 April 1947. His estate was divided among his children Graham Patriquin, Francis Lohnes, and Flora Gordon.<br />
      On 18 July 1947 Graham Patriquin agreed to sell the Randall house and land for $7000. It was reported that the house needed a new roof, extra rafters, new steps and floor for the front porch, two coats of paint on the exterior, repairs to baseboards and cellar windows, and painting of rooms and repairing ceilings. The garden plot was to be ploughed and put into lawn. His Majesty the King in right of Nova Scotia was the lessor and the WHS was the Lessee. "The rental fee will be $1 per annum payable the second day of each year for twenty years, beginning January 1948, to the Deputy Provincial Treasurer, the last payment in 1967." The Lessee could acquire the property after twenty years or could renew the rental agreement.<br />

Ranulf I of Poitiers (died 866) was a Count of Poitiers and Duke ofAquitaine.<br />
 <br />
He is considered a possible son of Gerard, Count of Auvergne and Hildegard / Matilda, daughter of Louis the Pious and Ermengarde.<br />
 <br />
Although not much is known about Ranulf I, he died in 866 in Aquitaine, France.<br />
 <br />
His son, Ranulf II of Poitiers, then inherited Poitiers and later acquired Aquitaine. Through the duchy of Aquitaine, he is the ancestor of Eleanor of Aquitaine, thus he is also an ancestor of the present-day British Royal Family.<br />

Dafydd ab Owain Gwynedd (died 1203) was Prince of Gwynedd from 1170 to 1195. He was the son of Owain Gwynedd by Cristin verch Goronwy. For a time he ruled jointly with his brothers Maelgwyn ab Owain Gwynedd and Rhodri ab Owain Gwynedd.<br />
 <br />
Upon the death of Owain Gwynedd in 1170, his sons fell into dispute over lordship of Gwynedd. Together, Dafydd and Rhodri attacked and killed their brother Hywel that same year. Dafydd drove out Maelgwn in 1173, sending him fleeing to Ireland. Another brother, Cynan, died in 1174, removing one more contender for the throne.<br />

William de Albini (Brito) (d 1155-6), justiciar, was son and heir ofRobert de Todeni, lord of Belvoir, and is supposed to have been named deAubigny (Albini) from his place of birth, and to have been distinguishedby the addition Brito from his namesake, the Pincerna, who belonged to adifferent family. He assisted in the victory of Tenchebray in 1106, andbecame high in favour of Henry I. IN 1130 he appears as an itinerantjustice, and on Henry's death he espoused the cause of his daughter.Stephen forfeited his lands, but subsequently restored them, and he livedto see the accession of Henry II. Foss wrongly states that he died in1135. [Dictionary of National Biography I:233]<br />
 <br />
-----------------------------------------------------<br />
 <br />
William, who assumed, from what reason is unascertained, the surname of Albini, and was known as "William de Albini, Brito," in contradistinction to another great Baron, "William de Albini, Pincerna," from whom the Earls of Arundel descended. William de Albini, Brito, Lord of Belvoir, in the Chapter House of St. Albans, confirmed all the grants of his father and mother to the Church of Our Lady at Belvoir, desiring that he might be admitted in the fraternity as those his parents had been. This feudal lord acquired great renown at the celebrated battle of Tinchebray, in Normandy, where, commanding the horse, he charged the enemy with so much spirit that he determine at once the fate of the day. of the exploit, Matthew Paris says, "In this encounter chiefly deserveth honour the most heroic William de Albini, the Briton, who, with his sword, broke through the enemy, and terminated the battle." He subsequently adhered to the Empress Maud and had his castle of Belvoir, with all his other lands, seized by King Stephen and transferred to Ranulph, Earl of Chester. He m. Maud, dau. of Simon de St. Liz, 1st Earl of Huntingdon, widow of Robert, son of Richard de Tunbridge, and ding about the year 1155, left two sons, viz., William, surnamed Meschines, and Ralph. [Sir Bernard Burke, Dormant, Abeyant, Forfeited and Extinct Peerages, Burke's Peerage, Ltd., London, England, 1883, p. 160, Daubeney, Barons Daubeney, Earl of Bridgewater]<br />

 <br />
Willelm de Albini Brito was a younger son of the Breton seigneur Main of Saint-Aubin-d'Aubigne (Ille-et-Vilaine) and his Norman wife Adelaide de Bohun. His cognomen Brito distinguished him from his Norman namesake, the Pincerna, who came from Saint-Martin-d'Aubigny (Manche). He assisted in the victory of Tinchebray in 1106, and became high in favour with Henry I, attesting numerous royal charters, the earliest belonging to the period 1104 to 1116. He married Cecilia, daughter of Roger Bigod and Adeliz de Tosny and (after her mother's death post 1136) principal coheiress of her maternal grandfather Robert de Tosny, lord of the honour of Belvoir in Lincolnshire (d 1088). William appears to have held land in Lincolnshire, Leicestershire, Essex, Hertfordshire and Northamptonshire, some or all of which was his wife's marriage portion. The bulk of the Tosny inheritance, however, including Belvoir, appears not to have been held by William and Cecilia until c 1130, after the death of Cecilia's mother Adeliz. Cecilia's younger sister Maud married William de Albini Pincerna. In 1130 William appears as an itinerant justice in Lincolnshire. Between 1135 and 1143 he attested a number of Lincolnshire charters by King Stephen. In 1146 Stephen granted William's estates to Ranulf of Chester. The general tenor of the grant, and the absence of any indication that William had joined the Empress, indicate that Stephen was granting the overlordship of William's estates in order to gain Randulf's support, and not that William had suffered any royal disfavour. William was alive at least until 1148, the earliest possible date for a charter he gave for Pipewell abbey (Northants). By his wife (who survived him) he had issue two daughters, Matilda and Basilia, and four or five sons, including his eventual successor in Belvoir William II (d 1168) and Ralph, who died at the siege of Acre in 1191. Much of the information on William's family comes from the 'Liber Vitae' of Thorney Abbey, where their anniversaries were remembered. William and Cecilia completed the foundation of Belvoir priory, begun by Robert de Tosny. They and many of their descendants were buried there. [Domesday Descendants pp271-272]<br />

The Mortimers of Norfolk held under the Earls Warenne a fief of whichAttleborough was the caput, and Scoulton, Raveningham, Stanford andRockland among its members. No blood relationship has been proved betweenthem and the Mortimers; of Wigmore, but the history of the latter familywas also associated with that of the great house of Warenne; for when thecastle and seignory of Mortemer-sur-Eaulne were forfeited in 1054 byRoger de Mortemer (ancestor of the Mortimers of Wigmore) they weregranted to William de Warenne.<br />
 <br />
ROBERT DE MORTIMER, the first of the family of whom there is record in Norfolk, witnessed a charter of William de Warenne to Castleacre Priory, probably in the time of Henry I. [Complete Peerage IX:243, (transcribed by Dave Utzinger)]<br />
 <br />
Note: As Henry I died in 1135, and Robert was of age when he witnessed a charter, then Robert was b. before 1114 at least. I think about 1100/1105.<br />

Uchtred FitzFergus (c.1120-September 22, 1174) was Lord of Galloway from 1161 to 1174, ruling jointly with his brother Gilbert of Galloway. They were sons of Fergus of Galloway; their mother may have been an illegitimate daughter of King Henry I of England.<br />
 <br />
As a boy he was sent as a hostage to the court of King Malcolm IV of Scotland. When his father, Prince Fergus, died in 1161, Uchtred was made co-ruler of Galloway along with Gilbert. They participated in King William I of Scotland's disastrous invasion of Northumberland in 1174. King William was captured, and the Galwegians rebelled, taking the opportunity to slaughter the Norman and Saxon settlers in their land. During this time Uchtred was brutally mutilated, blinded, castrated, and killed by his brother Gilbert and Gilbert's son, Malcolm. Gilbert then seized control of Galloway entire.<br />
 <br />
Uchtred had married Gunhilda of Dunbar, and they were the parents of Roland of Galloway and Eve of Galloway, wife of Walter de Berkeley.<br />

June 9, 2003 - it was the day of the my greatest sorrow.  It was the daythat saw the passing of my wife, Tristen.  She was 25 years old, and wehad so many hopes and dreams for our future together that never came topass.  She was gone, and I remained.  God, however, desired for me to domore than just remain.  After first sustaining me with His love, Hepersuaded me that my life would only be full if I invested in people.Instead of allowing my pain to build up protective walls from others, Iwas being called to comfort others with the comfort that I, myself, hadbeen comforted with (2 Cor. 1:4).<br />
I knew that God was calling me to seminary, but I also knew that it was not time for me to move away from the support of my family and friends. The decision to enroll at NABS (now Sioux Falls Seminary) was primarily due to its location.  I soon discovered, however, that there were many more reasons to stay.  From my first class, I felt God affirming my call and equipping me specifically for pastoral ministry.  I have also been greatly blessed by the faculty and community that I have come to know at Sioux Falls Seminary.  The diversity of both the professors and the students has challenged me along the way, and has given be a broad base for ministry.<br />
December 30, 2006 - it was a great day of rejoicing.  It was the day that I married Caroline, a second precious daughter that the Lord has blessed me with.  I've now graduated, and working in a pastoral position.  When I lost Tristen, my life felt so void of purpose.  But since then, God has been refilling my cup.<br />
 <br />
If you feel God telling you that it is time to pursue His calling for your life, don't wait any longer.  He wants to do amazing things in and through you.<br />

Iorwerth ab Owain Gwynedd or Iorwerth Drwyndwn (1145-1174), meaning "thebroken-nosed", was a legitimate son of Owain Gwynedd (the king ofGwynedd) and his first wife Gwladys ferch Llywarch. He married Mararedferch Madog. His son Llywelyn ab Iorwerth eventually united the realm andbecame known as Llywelyn Fawr and is one of Wales's most famous monarchs.Iorwerth was killed in battle at a place called Pennant Mehangell duringthe wars deciding the succession following the death of his father.<br />

From Wikipedia<br />
 <br />
Llywelyn ap Iorwerth (c. 1173-April 11, 1240) was a Prince of Gwynedd. Although he is often referred to as a Prince of Wales, his official title was "Prince of Aberffraw and Lord of Snowdon" (the first "official" Prince of Wales was his son, Dafydd). He was also known as Llywelyn the Great or, in Welsh, Llywelyn Fawr.<br />
 <br />
Llywelyn was born in 1173, the grandson of Owain Gwynedd. His father Iorwerth having been disposed by Owain's other sons after Owain's death, Llywelyn was left to fend for himself until, as a youth, his natural superiority made itself felt and he defeated his uncles to take Gwynedd for himself. He consolidated this conquest in 1205 by marrying Joan, illegitimate daughter of King John of England. Despite occasional disputes with John and his successor, Henry III, Llywelyn succeeded in maintaining Welsh independence. After a long struggle, he gained the ascendancy over his main rival, Gwenwynwyn of Powys, so as to unite the country.<br />
 <br />
His marriage to Joan has an unusual history. Following the birth of a legitimate heir, Dafydd ap Llywelyn, and a daughter, Elen (who was married off to the Norman Earl of Chester), Joan committed adultery with William de Braose or Breos, a Norman noble of south Wales who had allied himself with Llywelyn by the marriage of his daughter, Isabella, to Llywelyn's son, Dafydd. On learning of the affair in 1230, Llywelyn executed de Braose and Joan was imprisoned. Some time later, she was forgiven and restored to her position as princess, dying in 1237.<br />
 <br />
Llywelyn died in 1240 and a power struggle arose between his legitimate son, Dafydd, and his older, illegitimate son, Gruffydd, who according to Welsh law had equal rights of inheritance. Llywelyn had departed from tradition by naming Dafydd as his sole heir, as he recognised the Welsh custom of dividing inheritance equally amongst all male sons prevented a cohesive polity from forming, preventing a united Wales. Gruffydd was killed attempting to escape from the Tower of London in 1244, leaving the field clear for Dafydd, but Dafydd himself died without heirs in 1246, and was eventually succeeded by his nephew, Llywelyn the Last.<br />

The Halton barony held precedent over all othersand Nigel, the constable of Chester (Cheshire) became its first baron.Nigel erected a motte and bailey castle on Halton Hill around 1071 tokeep watch over the Lancashire and Cheshire plains and the river estuary.The stone structured castle, as is seen remained today, would havestarted development in the later half of the 12th century; beinggradually built upon, with each of the early barons undertaking variousprojects and adding to the work of his predecessor.<br />
 <br />
In 1115, Nigel's son, William Fitznigel, founded an Augustinian Priory at Runcorn. In 1134 the monks moved the priory to Norton, about three and a half miles away. The barons of Halton provided Norton Priory with substantial amounts of money until 1200. In 1391 the priory was raised to the higher status of abbey. In 1536 the monastery was dissolved, and a few years later the buildings and some of the monastic lands were sold to Sir Richard Brooke who converted the habitable part of the Abbey into a home for himself and his family.<br />

Laura Innes as Dr. Kerry Weaver on ER<br />
 <br />
Laura Elizabeth Innes (born August 16, 1959) is an American actress and director.<br />
 <br />
Innes was born in Pontiac, Michigan and introduced to professional theater by her father, who frequently took the family to the Stratford Shakespeare Festival in Ontario, Canada. Following his advice to "do what you love," she attended Northwestern University and earned a degree in theater.<br />
 <br />
Her first stage credits were in Chicago at the renowned Goodman Theater, where among other roles she played Stella opposite John Malkovich's Stanley in A Streetcar Named Desire. Other major stage credits include Two Shakespearean Actors with Eric Stoltz at Lincoln Center, Our Town at the Seattle Repertory Theatre, and Three Sisters at the La Jolla Playhouse in San Diego.<br />
 <br />
Innes guest-starred on television series such as Party of Five, My So-Called Life, and Brooklyn Bridge and appeared in the Emmy-winning cable movie And the Band Played On before being cast in her first major TV role as Thomas Haden Church's promiscuous ex-wife Bunny on the NBC comedy series Wings (1991-1993). She caught the attention of the creative team at the network's popular medical drama, ER, who during its second season cast her in the recurring role of Dr. Kerry Weaver, then made her a regular cast member when the series began its third season. Her character has served as a positive role model for both the physically-challenged and the lesbian community. She has received two Emmy Award nominations for her portrayal, as well as three Screen Actors Guild Awards as part of the "ER" ensemble, and has received five nominations for Best Supporting Actress from Viewers for Quality Television.<br />
 <br />
Innes has also directed several episodes of the series, as well as episodes of The West Wing, one of which earned her an Emmy nomination for directing.<br />
 <br />
In film, Innes has co-starred with Téa Leoni, Morgan Freeman, and Vanessa Redgrave in the blockbuster film Deep Impact and with ER castmate Noah Wyle in Canʼt Stop Dancing.<br />
 <br />
She is married to actor David Brisbin and the mother of two children, Cal and Mia.<br />
 <br />
------------------------------------------------------------<br />
From Yahoo:<br />
After years on the outskirts of fame, playing insignificant roles in TV-movies and series since 1995, this sharply beautiful, blonde actress found success as the tough, straightforward chief resident Kerry Weaver on the hugely popular NBC series "ER".<br />
 <br />
Innes spent much of the 1980s honing her talents onstage, including a four year stint acting with Chicago's Goodman Theater, where she appeared (as Stella) alongside John Malkovich (as Mitch) in a Chicago production of "A Streetcar Named Desire" and in the premiere of David Mamet's "Edmund". Her other stage work has included the Broadway production of "Two Shakespearean Actors", "Our Town" (Seattle, WA) and "Three Sisters" (La Jolla, CA). She also had a supporting role in the pilot "The Stiller and Meara Show" (NBC, 1986) and the TV-movies "Jacob Have I Loved" (PBS, 1989) and "Philby" (ABC, 1989).<br />
 <br />
After her marriage and the birth of her son, Innes decided to move to L.A. to pursue a career in TV and films. She guested on such shows as "My So-Called Life" and "Brooklyn Bridge" and from 1991-1993 appeared in several episodes of "Wings" (NBC) as Bunny, the dizzily nymphomaniac ex-wife of eccentric mechanic Lowell Mather (Thomas Haden Church). Innes also had small roles in four 1993 TV-movies, notably "Judith Krantz's 'Torch Song'" (ABC) and the award-winning "And the Band Played On" (HBO), as an hemophiliac.<br />
 <br />
In 1995, she simultaneously played two roles: Louie Anderson's wife on the short-lived CBS sitcom "The Louie Show" (which was broadcast early in 1996), and the stern Dr. Weaver on 14 episodes of "ER". In 1996, she had a leading role in the Disney TV-movie "Just Like Dad" and her popularity was rewarded when Dr. Weaver was made a permanent cast member of "ER" as of the 1996-1997 season. The character's hard edges were also softened a bit to make her more palatable for the long haul.<br />

 <br />
John de Braose, called Tadody (1198-July 18, 1232) was the Welsh Marches lord of Bramber and Gower. He was the eldest son of William de Braose (himself son of William de Braose, Fourth Lord of Bramber) and Matilda de Clare, the daughter of Richard de Clare, 4th Earl of Hertford.<br />
 <br />
John was nicknamed Tadody ("fatherless" in Welsh) after his father was starved to death in 1210 on the orders of King John I of England. At first he was hidden in Gower, but finally in 1214 his guardian surrendered John and his younger brother Philip. In June 1215 John was present for the signing of the Magna Carta. He was released from custody in 1218, having spent some time with his uncle Giles, Bishop of Hertford.<br />
 <br />
Much of his adult life was spent in disputes with relatives over his inheritance. In 1219 he married Marared, the daughter of Llywelyn Fawr, and received Gower as her dowry. In 1226 his uncle Reginald de Braose sold him Bramber, and he inherited still more when this uncle died a few years later. He and Marared had three sons, including his heir, William.<br />
 <br />
In 1232 John was killed in a fall from his horse.<br />

Olaf Gudrødsson, or as he was named after his death Olaf Geirstad-Alf, was a legendary Norwegian king of the House of Yngling from the Ynglinga saga. He was the son of Gudrød the Hunter and the brother of Halfdan the Black. Gudrød and Olaf conquered a large part of Raumarike.<br />
 <br />
Gudrød died when Olaf was twenty years old and he and Halfdan divided their kingdom between them. Olaf took the southern part and resided in Geirstad. They only inherited the Westfold because Alfgeir took Vingulmark for himself and made his son Gandalf Alfgeirsson its king.<br />
 <br />
The Ynglinga saga relates that Olaf was a skillful man and a great warrior. He was also handsome, big and strong.<br />
 <br />
During the reigns of Olaf and his brother Halfdan the Black, Värmland started to pay tribute to the Swedish king Erik Anundsson instead.<br />
 <br />
Olaf was the father of Ragnvald the Mountain-High and he died of illness.<br />

    Long while this branch of Odin's stem<br />
    Was the stout prop of Norway's realm;<br />
    Long while King Olaf with just pride<br />
    Ruled over Westfold far and wide.<br />
    At length by cruel gout oppressed,<br />
    The good King Olaf sank to rest:<br />
    His body now lies under ground,<br />
    Buried at Geirstad, in the mound.<br />
 <br />
After his death, he was worshipped as an elf, and was called the Geirstad-alf, the "elf of Geirstad".<br />
 <br />
A hypothesis identifies Geirstad with Gjerstad near Gokstad, and his burial with the Gokstad Ship.<br />

Gudrød the Hunter (Old Norse: Guđröđr veiđikonung, Modern Icelandic: Guđröđur veiđikonung, Norwegian: Gudrød Veidekonge) was the son of Halfdan the Mild of the House of Yngling and of Liv Dagsdotter of Vestmar, according to Heimskringla, a collection of sagas from thirteenth century Iceland.<br />
 <br />
Gudröd married Alfhild, a daughter of Alfarin the king of Alfheim (Bohuslän), which was the name of the area between Glomma and Göta älv, and inherited half the province of Vingulmark. They had the son Olaf Gudrødsson.<br />
 <br />
When Alfhild died, Gudröd sent his warriors to Agder and its king Harald to propose a marriage with his daughter Åsa. However, Harald declined so Gudröd decided to take his daughter by force.<br />
 <br />
They arrived at night time and when Harald realised that he was attacked he assembled his men and fought well, but died together with his son Gyrd. Gudröd carried away Åsa and married her. He raped her and she gave him a son named Halfdan who would be called Halfdan the Black.<br />
 <br />
In the fall when Halfdan was a year old, Gudröd was having at a feast in Stiflesund. He was very drunk and in the evening as he was walking on the gangway to leave the ship, an assassin thrust a spear through Gudröd and he was killed. Gudröd's men instantly killed the assassin who turned out to be Åsa's page-boy. Åsa admitted that the page-boy had acted on her behalf.<br />

 <br />
Ramon Berenguer IV, Count of Barcelona the Saint ( b. ca. 1113, d. August 6, 1162) is most known for effecting the union between Catalonia and Aragon.<br />
 <br />
He inherited the county of Barcelona from his father Ramon Berenguer III on August 19, 1131. On August 11, 1137 in Huesca he was betrothed to the infant Petronila of Aragon, aged 3 at the time. Her father, Ramiro II of Aragon the Monk, who sought Barcelona's aid against Alfonso VII of Castile, abdicated on November 13 that same year, leaving his kingdom to Petronila and her husband. The latter essentially became ruler of Aragon, although he never styled himself king, but instead Count of Barcelona, Prince of the Kingdom of Aragon. He was the last Catalan monarch to use the title of Count as his first; starting with his son Alfonso II of Aragon the counts of Barcelona styled themselves, in the first place, as kings of Aragon.<br />
 <br />
The treaty between Ramon Berenger and his father-in-law stipulated that their descendants would rule jointly over both realms. Even should Petronila die before the marriage could be consummated, Barcelona would still inherit the Crown of Aragon. Both realms would preserve their laws, institutions and autonomy, remaining legally distinct but federated in a dynastic union under one ruling House.<br />
 <br />
Historians consider this arrangement the political masterstroke of the Hispanic Middle Ages. Both realms gained greater strength and security and Aragon got its much needed outlet to the sea. On the other hand, formation of a new political entity in the southeast at a time when Portugal seceded from Castile in the west gave more balance to the Christian kingdoms of the peninsula.<br />
 <br />
Ramon Berenguer successfully pulled Aragon out of its pledged submission to Castile, aided no doubt by the beauty and charm of his sister Berenguela, wife of Alfonso the Emperor, for which she was well-known in her time. After that, in the middle years of his rule, his attention turned to campaigns against the Moors. In 1147 he helped Castile to conquer Almeŕıa. In 1148 he turned against the lands of the Almoravid taifa kingdom of Valencia and Murcia, capturing Tortosa and, the next year, Fraga, Lleida and Mequinenza in the confluence of the Segre, Cinca and Ebro. The reconquista of the actual Catalonia was complete.<br />
 <br />
Ramon Berenger also campaigned in Provence, helping his brother Berenguer Ramon and his infant nephew Ramon Berenguer II against Counts of Toulouse. During the minority of Ramon Berenger II the Count of Barcelona also acted as the regent of Provence (between 1144 and 1157).<br />
 <br />
In 1151 Ramon Berenguer the Saint founded and endowed the royal monastery of Poblet. He died in 1162 in Borgo Sam Dalmazzo, Piedmont, Italy, leaving his Aragon and Catalonia to his eldest son Ramon Berenguer, who, in compliment to the Aragonese, changed his name to Alfonso and became Alfonso II of Aragon, I of Catalonia. Ramon Berenguer's younger son Pedro inherited the county of Cerdagne and lands north of the Pyrenees.<br />

 <br />
Gruffydd ap Llywelyn (c. 1000 - August 5, 1063) was the ruler of all Wales from 1055 until his death, one of very few able to make this boast. He was of a cadet branch of the princely house of Mathrafal of Powys, though himself not described as being royal.<br />
 <br />
Genealogy and early life<br />
 <br />
Gruffydd was the only son of Llywelyn ap Seisyll, who had been able to seize both Gwynedd and Powys from their traditional dynasties. On Llywelyn's death in 1033, a member of the traditional Aberffraw dynasty, Iago ab Idwal ap Meurig, became ruler of Gwynedd. Gruffydd according to tradition had been a lazy youth, but one New Year's Eve, he was driven out of the house by his exasperated sister. Leaning against the wall of another house, he heard a cook who was boiling pieces of beef in a cauldron complain that there was one piece of meat which kept coming to the top of the cauldron, however often it was thrust down. Gruffydd took the comment to apply to him, and began to work to gain power.<br />
 <br />
King of Gwynedd and Powys 1039-1055<br />
 <br />
In 1039 Iago ab Idwal was killed by his own men (his son Cynan ap Iago went into exile in Dublin) and Gruffydd already the usurper-king of Powys was able to become king of Gwynedd by 1039. Soon after gaining power he surprised a Mercian army at Rhyd y Groes near Welshpool and totally defeated it, killing its leader, Edwin, the brother of Earl Leofric of Mercia. He then attacked the neighbouring principality of Deheubarth which was now ruled by Hywel ab Edwin. Gruffydd defeated Hywel in a battle at Pencader in 1041 and carried off Hywel's wife. Gruffydd seems to have been able to drive Hywel out of Deheubarth in about 1043, for in 1044 Hywel is recorded as returning with a Danish fleet to the mouth of the River Tywi to try to reclaim his kingdom. Gruffydd however defeated and killed him.<br />
 <br />
Gruffydd ap Rhydderch of Gwent was able to expel Gruffydd ap Llywelyn from Deheubarth in 1047 and became king of Deheubarth himself after the nobles of Ystrad Tywi had suddenly attacked and killed 140 of Gruffydd ap Llywelyn's household guard. He was able to resist several attacks by Gruffydd ap Llywelyn in the following years. Gruffydd ap Llywelyn was active on the Welsh border in 1052, when he attacked Herefordshire and defeated a mixed force of Normans and English near Leominster.<br />
 <br />
King of Wales 1055-1063<br />
 <br />
In 1055 Gruffydd ap Llywelyn killed his rival Gruffydd ap Rhydderch in battle and recaptured Deheubarth. Gruffydd now allied himself with Ælfgar, son of Earl Leofric of Mercia, who had been deprived of his earldom of East Anglia by Harold Godwinson and his brothers. They marched on Hereford and were opposed by a force led by the Earl of Hereford, Ralph the Timid. This force was mounted and armed in the Norman fashion, but on October 24 Gruffydd defeated it. He then sacked the city and destroyed its Norman castle. Earl Harold was given the task of counter attacking, but was not able to penetrate very far. Shortly afterwards Ælfgar was restored to his earldom and a peace treaty concluded. Gruffydd married Ælfgar's daughter, Ealdgyth.<br />
 <br />
Around this time Gruffydd was also able to seize Morgannwg and Gwent, along with extensive territories along the border with England. In 1056 he won another victory over an English army near Glasbury. He now claimed sovereignty over the whole of Wales - a claim which was recognised by the English.<br />
 <br />
Death and aftermath<br />
 <br />
Gruffydd reached an agreement with Edward the Confessor, but the death of his ally Ælfgar in 1062 left him more vulnerable. In late 1062 Harold Godwinson obtained the king's approval for a surprise attack on Gruffydd's court at Rhuddlan. Gruffydd was nearly captured, but was warned in time to escape out to sea in one of his ships, though his other ships were destroyed. In the spring of 1063 Harold's brother Tostig led an army into north Wales while Harold led to fleet first to south Wales and then north to meet with his brother's army. Gruffydd was forced to take refuge in Snowdonia, but at this stage his own men killed him, on 5 August according to Brut y Tywysogion. The Ulster Chronicle states that he was killed by Cynan ap Iago, whose father Iago ab Idwal had been put to death by Gruffydd in 1039. [1] Gruffydd had probably made enemies in the course of uniting Wales under his rule. Walter Map has preserved a comment from Gruffydd himself about this:<br />
    Speak not of killing; I but blunt the horns of the offspring of Wales lest they should injure their dam.<br />
 <br />
Gruffydd's head and the figurehead of his ship were sent to Harold.<br />
 <br />
Following Gruffydd's death, Harold married his widow Ealdgyth, though she was to be widowed again three years later. Gruffydd's realm was divided again into the traditional kingdoms. Bleddyn ap Cynfyn and his brother Rhiwallon came to an agreement with Harold and were given the rule of Gwynedd and Powys. Thus when Harold was defeated and killed at the Battle of Hastings in 1066 the Normans reaching the borders of Wales were confronted by the traditional kingdoms rather than a single king. Gruffydd left two sons who in 1070 challenged Bleddyn and Rhiwallon at the battle of Mechain in an attempt to win back part of their father's kingdom. However they were defeated, one being killed and the other dying of exposure after the battle.<br />

IN MEMORIUM<br />
Wilfred B. Schofield, 1927-2008<br />
Wilfred Borden Schofield, beloved father of Linda, Muriel, and Pamela, and grandfather to Aisha, Elise, Shayden and Kai, passed away peacefully in the early morning of November 5, 2008 at Marion Hospice in Vancouver, following a brief battle with cancer. Wilf was born in Brooklyn Corner, NS, in 1927. He attended Acadia University to become a certified school teacher, but his passion for mosses led him into graduate work at Stanford University (MSc 1956) and Duke University (PhD 1960). He met Peggy while at Stanford and they were engaged to be married after a one-month courtship. Their honeymoon in the Arctic, where Wilf conducted field research, produced many fond memories. He joined the UBC Botany Department in 1960. As an emeritus professor, up to the month before his passing, he was actively conducting research, writing scholarly texts, teaching and mentoring. His research took him to numerous places around the world, including New Zealand, Japan, Australia and Tasmania. Field work conducted in Alaska over the last 15 summers will provide data for a book on the Aleutian moss flora. The text will be completed posthumously through the generosity of friends and colleagues. Over the years, a number of mosses, other nonvascular plants, and one flowering plant have been described in his honour. Wilf's greatest joy was sharing his enthusiasm for bryophytes. He loved, in almost equal measure, literature, classical music, art, and a good cup of tea. Details of a memorial celebration will be announced soon on www.caringbridge.org/visit/wilfschofield. The Canadian Journal of Botany has agreed to publish a Festschrift for Wilf. Rene Belland (former PDF with Wilf) and Iain Taylor will edit the papers for publication.<br />
UBC Department of Botany Newsletter, No.4<br />
----------------------------------<br />
It is with great sadness that we mark the passing of Canadaʼs leading, and most celebrated bryologist, Professor Emeritus Wilfred Borden Schofield. Wilf passed away on November 5, 2008, having succumbed to cancer. He was 81.<br />
Wilf was born in Brooklyn Corner, Nova Scotia on July 19, 1927. He attended Acadia University from 1946-50 where he earned a B.A. with the intention of becoming a school teacher. However, his love of plants, nurtured through the mentorship of Chalmers Smith and J.S. Erskine, led him to pursue postgraduate studies that included work in both bryology (taxonomy) and vascular plants (ecology). Acadia University later bestowed upon him an Honorary Doctorate of Science in recognition of his lifelong contributions to botany (1990).<br />
Wilf completed his M.A. at Stanford University in 1956 under the direction of W.C. Steere, a well known American bryologist, who eventually became the Director of the New York Botanic Garden. His thesis was a taxonomic work on a difficult genus entitled "The relationships and Geographic Distribution of Canadian and Alaskan species of Hypnum". Wilfʼs lifelong interest in this genus eventually resulted in the publication of a North American revision for the Bryophyte Flora of North America (http://www.efloras.org/florataxon.aspx?flora_id=50&taxon_id=116204). During his time at Stanford, Wilf worked with another well known bryologist, Howard Crum, who was the Curator of Cryptogams at the National Museum in Ottawa at the time. Wilf spent two field seasons (1955-56) with Crum collecting bryophytes in the Rocky Mountains, from Waterton Lakes to the Yukon Territory.<br />
It was while he was at Stanford that Wilf met his future bride, Margaret (Peggy) Irene (nee Bledsoe; d. 2005). After a short courtship, they were married in 1956. Soon after completing his M.A. (and for Peggy, her M.A. in Music), they moved to North Carolina, where Wilf began Ph.D. studies with the plant ecologist, H.J. Oosting, at Duke University. This time, it was an ecological thesis, entitled "The Ecotone between Spruce Fir and Deciduous Forest in the Great Smoky Mountains". Wilf graduated in 1960, and soon after he and Peggy moved to Vancouver, British Columbia where Wilf had accepted a position as a faculty member with the Department of Botany at the University of British Columbia.<br />
Before they moved west, friends warned Wilf, "Donʼt go there all the weird ones move west". I donʼt think Wilf was ever considered "weird", but it was in British Columbia that he fuelled his passion for bryophytes and began a long, outstanding career as the foremost bryologist in Canada. He retired in 1992 but was appointed Professor Emeritus shortly thereafter.<br />
Wilfʼs interests were mainly phytogeographic, at least in the early and middle years, when he published many papers on the floristics and distribution of bryophytes in British Columbia. Among the more important works is a contribution to a volume on the Queen Charlotte Islands. The chapter, entitled "Structure and affinities of the bryoflora of the Queen Charlotte Islands" was the culmination of 35 years of field work on the islands.<br />
In his later years, Wilf contributed numerous taxonomic papers on the genera Hypnum, Taxithelium, Brotherella, and the family Sematophyllaceae, among others. In addition he contributed extensively to the Bryophyte flora of North America: Takakiaceae, Buxbaumiaceae, Hypnum, Buxbaumiaceae, Diphysciaceae, Disceliaceae, Dicranoweisia, and Rhabdoweisia.<br />
His publications reflect Wilfʼs diverse interests and his adeptness as a botanist. Although he specialized in mosses and liverworts, he also published at least eight papers on lichens and vascular plants.<br />
In addition to peer reviewed articles, Wilfʼs publications include chapters in four plant textbooks (An Evolutionary Survey of the Plant Kingdom, Plant Diversity: An Evolutionary Approach, Nonvascular Plants: An Evolutionary Survey, Plants: An Evolutionary Survey), an introductory bryophyte textbook (Introduction to Bryology), as well as numerous field handbooks.<br />
Wilf taught courses in Phytogeography, Bryology, and "Ferns and Allies". As a teacher he was tireless. He devoted considerable energy updating his notes, which he did yearly. In the bryology and ferns course he used fresh material as much as possible, which he often collected the day of the lab or the day before. Sometimes he would do so by walking through the Pacific Spirit Park on his way to work.<br />
The introductory bryophyte textbook gained some notoriety. The book arose as a result of the bryology course, and is an expansion of his notes for that course. It was published in 1986 and earned several accolades: "Excellence in book design and production" by the Association of American Publishers, and the George Lawson Medal for 1986 for the same book Introduction to Bryology by the Canadian Botanical Association for "single contribution to botanical knowledge of outstanding distinction."<br />
Wilf had a deep love of field work which lasted to the end of his life: he had spent the summer in Alaska before his passing later that fall. He believed that to truly understand and know the bryophytes, one had to see and study them in their natural habitat. It was only in this way that one could learn the habitats and microhabitat requirement of individual species and understand their morphological diversity. His direct and extensive experience with bryophytes in the field was reflected not only in his works, but also in his reputation: he was considered by colleagues, students, and acquaintances to be a wealth of botanical knowledge and was frequently sought after for advice and information.<br />
There were very few years in which Wilf did not spend a summer in the field. Most of his field work was in British Columbia. He was particularly fond of the Queen Charlotte Islands, where he conducted field work over 35 years. He also spent many seasons along the coast and worked five summers in the Atlantic Provinces. During the last 15 years of his life however, summers were spent collecting in the Aleutian Islands. The latter work will culminate in a moss flora of the Aleutians, one which is nearly complete. It will be finished posthumously.<br />
Wilf was an avid plant collector. Some referred to him as a ʻgarbage baggerʼ in reference to the volumes of material that he amassed during field trips. But there was a reason for this ʻmadnessʼ. Wilf felt strongly that if one was to collect for science, then it was important to obtain good material, and enough material for duplicates. As a result, the bryophyte collection at UBC is second in size only to the National Museum in Ottawa (CANM) - all due to Wilfʼs assiduousness. On size of the CANM collection Wilf would remark that, "CANM is only bigger because I sent them so many duplicates!" In any case, there are many herbaria around the world that will never be able to repay their "exchangeʼ debt to UBC because of Wilfʼs hard work. Moreover, the "data" in the form of specimen vouchers that Wilf has contributed to bryology will always remain invaluable to our understanding of the distributions of bryophytes. His last collecting number was 128,619. It was a Bryum species collected from Umak Island, not long after the volcano erupted.<br />
The greatness of individuals is often measured by their accomplishments. While Wilfʼs accomplishments in bryology will be remembered and have influence on the science for many years, it will undoubtedly be the person himself that many of us will remember most. Wilf was a great person, a genuine, generous and welcoming person. On my first meeting with him, he ushered me into his office and immediately offered me a cup oʼ tea. We then chatted and discussed bryology, politics, books and many other topics. I later watched him welcome many others into his office, students, colleagues, professors. All were treated equally and with sincere hospitality. Wilf will be dearly missed.<br />

Owain Gwynedd<br />
From Wikipedia, 12 June 2006:<br />
 <br />
Owain Gwynedd (in English, "Owen") (c. 1100 - November 28, 1170), alternatively known by the patronymic "Owain ap Gruffydd" and also as Owain I of Gwynedd and occasionally Owain I of Wales on account of his domination of the territory. He is considered to be the most successful of all the north Welsh princes prior to his grandson, Llywelyn the Great. He was known as Owain Gwynedd to distinguish him from another contemporary Owain ap Gruffydd, ruler of part of Powys who was known as Owain Cyfeiliog. Owain Gwynedd was a member of the House of Aberffraw, a descendant of the senior branch from Rhodri Mawr.<br />
Early life<br />
 <br />
Owain's father, Gruffydd ap Cynan, was a strong and long-lived ruler who had made the principality of Gwynedd the most influential in Wales during the sixty-two years of his reign, using the island of Anglesey as his power base. His mother, Angharad ferch Owain, was the daughter of Owain ab Edwin. Owain was the second of three sons of Gruffydd and Angharad.<br />
 <br />
Owain is thought to have been born on Anglesey about the year 1100. By about 1120 Gruffydd had grown too old to lead his forces in battle and Owain and his brothers Cadwallon and later Cadwaladr led the forces of Gwynedd against the Normans and against other Welsh princes with great success. His elder brother Cadwallon was killed in a battle against the forces of Powys in 1132, leaving Owain as his father's heir. Owain and Cadwaladr, in alliance with Gruffydd ap Rhys of Deheubarth, won a major victory over the Normans at Crug Mawr near Cardigan in 1136 and annexed Ceredigion to their father's realm.<br />
 <br />
Accession to the throne and early campaigns<br />
 <br />
On Gruffydd's death in 1137, therefore, Owain inherited a portion of a well-established kingdom, but had to share it with Cadwaladr. In 1143 Cadwaladr was implicated in the murder of Anarawd ap Gruffydd of Deheubarth, and Owain responded by sending his son Hywel ab Owain Gwynedd to strip him of his lands in the north of Ceredigion. Though Owain was later reconciled with Cadwaladr, from 1143, Owain ruled alone over most of north Wales. In 1155 Cadwaladr was driven into exile.<br />
 <br />
Owain took advantage of the civil war in England between King Stephen and the Empress Matilda to push Gwynedd's boundaries further east than ever before. In 1146 he captured the castle of Mold and about 1150 captured Rhuddlan and encroached on the borders of Powys. The prince of Powys, Madog ap Maredudd, with assistance from Earl Ranulf of Chester, gave battle at Coleshill, but Owain was victorious.<br />
 <br />
War with King Henry II<br />
 <br />
All went well until the accession of King Henry II of England in 1154. Henry invaded Gwynedd in 1157 with the support of Madog ap Maredudd of Powys and Owain's brother Cadwaladr. The invasion met with mixed fortunes. King Henry was nearly killed in a skirmish near Basingwerk and the fleet accompanying the invasion made a landing on Anglesey where it was defeated. Owain was however forced to come to terms with Henry, being obliged to surrender Rhuddlan and other conquests in the east.<br />
 <br />
Madog ap Maredudd died in 1160, enabling Owain to regain territory in the east. In 1163 he formed an alliance with Rhys ap Gruffydd of Deheubarth to challenge English rule. King Henry again invaded Gwynedd in 1165, but instead of taking the usual route along the northern coastal plain, the king's army invaded from Oswestry and took a route over the Berwyn hills. The invasion was met by an alliance of all the Welsh princes, with Owain as the undisputed leader. However there was little fighting, for the Welsh weather came to Owain's assistance as torrential rain forced Henry to retreat in disorder. The infuriated Henry mutilated a number of Welsh hostages, including two of Owain's sons.<br />
 <br />
Henry did not invade Gwynedd again and Owain was able to regain his eastern conquests, recapturing Rhuddlan castle in 1167 after a siege of three months.<br />
 <br />
Disputes with the church and succession<br />
 <br />
The last years of Owain's life were spent in disputes with the Archbishop of Canterbury, Thomas Becket, over the appointment of a new Bishop of Bangor. When the see became vacant Owain had his nominee, Arthur of Bardsey, elected. The archbishop refused to accept this, so Owain had Arthur consecrated in Ireland. The dispute continued, and the see remained officially vacant until well after Owain's death. He was also put under pressure by the Archbishop and the Pope to put aside his second wife, Cristin, who was his first cousin, this relationship making the marriage invalid under church law. Despite being excommunicated for his defiance, Owain steadfastly refused to put Cristin aside. Owain died in 1170, and despite having been excommunicated was buried in Bangor Cathedral by the local clergy. The annalist writing Brut y Tywysogion recorded his death "after innumerable victories, and unconquered from his youth".<br />
 <br />
He is believed to have commissioned the propaganda text, The Life of Gruffydd ap Cynan an account of his father's life. Following his death, civil war broke out between his sons. Owain was married twice, first to Gwladus ferch Llywarch ap Trahaearn, by whom he had two sons, Maelgwn ab Owain Gwynedd and Iorwerth Drwyndwn, the father of Llywelyn the Great, then to Cristin, by whom he had three sons including Dafydd ab Owain Gwynedd and Rhodri ab Owain Gwynedd. He also had a number of illegitimate sons, who by Welsh law had an equal claim on the inheritance if acknowledged by their father.<br />
 <br />
Heirs & Successors<br />
 <br />
Owain had originally designated Rhun ab Owain Gwynedd as his successor. Rhun was Owain's favourite son, and his premature death in 1147 plunged his father into a deep melancholy, from which he was only roused by the news that his forces had captured Mold castle. Owain then designated Hywel ab Owain Gwynedd as his successor, but after his death Hywel was first driven to seek refuge in Ireland by Cristin's sons, Dafydd and Rhodri, then killed at the battle of Pentraeth when he returned with an Irish army. Dafydd and Rhodri split Gwynedd between them, but a generation passed before Gwynedd was restored to its former glory under Owain's grandson Llywelyn the Great.<br />
 <br />
According to legend, one of Owain's sons was Prince Madoc, who is popularly supposed to have fled across the Atlantic and colonised America. Altogether the prodigeous Owain Gwynedd is said to have had the following children from two wives and at least four mistresses:<br />
 <br />
    * Rhun ab Owain Gwynedd (illegitimate)<br />
    * Hywel ab Owain Gwynedd (illegitimate)<br />
    * Iorwerth ab Owain Gwynedd (from first wife Gwladys ferch Llywarch)<br />
    * Maelgwn ab Owain Gwynedd, Lord of Ynys Môn<br />
    * Gwenllian ferch Owain Gwynedd<br />
    * Dafydd ab Owain Gwynedd (from second wife Cristina ferch Gronw)<br />
    * Rhodri ab Owain Gwynedd<br />
    * Angharad ferch Owain Gwynedd<br />
    * Margaret ferch Owain Gwynedd<br />
    * Iefan ab Owain Gwynedd<br />
    * Cynan ab Owain Gwynedd, Lord of Meirionnydd (illegitimate)<br />
    * Rhirid ab Owain Gwynedd (illegitimate)<br />
    * Madoc ab Owain Gwynedd (illegitimate)<br />
    * Cynwrig ab Owain Gwynedd (illegitimate)<br />

Having strong Puritan sympathies, he sailed from Plymouth for the new world, March 20, 1630, in company with 140 persons, on the ship Mary and John (Capt. Squeb) and arrived at Nantasket, Mass. (Hull), about twelve miles Southeast from Boston, after a passage of more than seventy days, on Sunday, May 30, 1630. The original destination of the vessel was Charles river, but an unfortunate misunderstanding which arose between the captain and the passengers resulted in their being put ashore by him at Nantasket. After searching for a few days for a good place in which to settle and make homes for themselves, they decided upon the spot, which they called Dorcester, in memory of the endeared home in England which many of them had left and especially of its revered pastor, Rev. John White, 'the great patron of New England emigration' who had especially encouraged them to come hither. (above from Dwight's History)<br />
 <br />
From Jedediah History Update: Elder John Strong- 2nd Arrival in America (1635) on the ship "Hopewell", John Driver, Master for Mass. Bay of New England. May 8, 1635-Weymouth. "Jon Stronge for himself, family, goods, and food."(Book #58B, entitled "Index of Ships and Passengers to the American Colonies")<br />
 <br />
Strong family tradition, based on the account written by Gov. Caleb Strong in 1777, maintains that Elder John Strong was a passenger on the ship "Mary and John" in 1630. James Savage in Geneal. Dictionary of the 1st Settlers of New Eng." 1860, discounts Elder John Strong having come on the "Mary and John". "Although Savage was correct in concluding John Strong did not come on the "Mary and John" in 1630 with his wife and children, it has not been proven that he did not come in 1630 as a youth. A number of young men of the "Mary and John" returned to England to marry." (Search for the Passengers of the Mary and John, Vol. 2).<br />
Elder John lived in Hingham, 1635, Taunton 1638, Winsor, CT 1646, and Northampton 1659. John Strong, Walter and John Deane were admitted freemen of the Plymouth Colony, December 4, 1638. Margerie Deane Strong and infant died about 1635 at Hingham or Taunton, MA.<br />
 <br />
from John Langbehn's database: "John 3 Strong "Elder" (John 2, George1). Born, circa 1605, in England. Died, 14 Apr 1699, in Northampton, MA. Resided in Dorchester, MA. Resided in Hingham, MA. Resided: 4 Dec 1638, in Taunton, MA. Resided in Windsor, CT."<br />
 <br />
That the Strongs of England, Ireland and Scotland are of a different origin respectively, would seem to be manifest from the variety of their family crests. The crest of the Strongs of Ireland is a lion rampart, azure, supporting a pillar argent (or silver); of those of Scotland, a cluster of grapes stalked and leaved; while of those of England there is a threefold variety of crest. One of them is, out of a mural coronet, gold, and an eagle, wings displayed, gold; another is an eagle with two heads,wings expanded: the third form of crest is an eagle displayed, gold. An eagle with wings expanded characterizes them all alike. Which of the three forms of crest belongs to the Strongs of this country, the author has no means of determining. Persons consulting books of heraldic symbols seem to have selected, on the principle of choosing the best, the first of the three English crests described as that of the American branch of the family . No one of whom the author has heard has in his possession any silver tankard, or other family relic, on which the real ensigns armorial of the family are engraved.<br />

Birth given as 1605 with parent's marriage in 1609. Strong family notes in Ohio Gen Lib, emigrated in 1630, deputy t o General Court in Plymouth in 1641, 1643, and 1644. The surname was originally also Straunge, Storange, and Stronge. Another source: Descendants of Palatiah and Iantha Strong, compiled by Herbert L. and Julia W. Strong, manuscript undated,purchased by Firelands Historical Society, 1991. Family characteristics are physical vigor and longevity. Source: Colonial and Revolutionary Lineage, vol. 3, DAR Library, Washington, DC. "Elder" John Strong came to New England about 1630, perhaps from the vicinity of "Southcard, in the parish of Chard", Somersetshire, where his first wife' s father, William Deane, died. The statement is found that John was a son of Richard Strong, of Taunton, England, but no definite proof is found. While it is stated that previous to coming to Taunton, in 1637, he divided his time between Dorchester and Hingham, Mass, his name is not found in the printed town records of Dorchester. John Strong had granted to him, in Hingham, Mass, Sept 18, 1635, five acres of land on North St, near Ship St. He was a freeman, 1636-37. He removed from there to Taunton, Mass, where he was one of "the 46 ancient purchasers of Taunton," in 1638; others were John Deane and Walter Deane. John Strong was the first constable of Taunton, which officer represented the Plymouth government in that new settlement in 1638. He was one of the seven freemen of Cohannet "sworn in" that same year. He was again appointed constable in 1639. He was deputy in 1641, 1642 and 1643, and was one of the foremost, most influential citizens. His house-lot was on Deane S t, next west of John Deane's lot. Mr. Strong appointed Walter Deane attorney to dispose of his real estate in Taunton, after he left. At some time before Feb, 1647, Elder Strong removed to Windsor, Conn, where several of his younger children were born. There he was appointed, with four others, "to superintend and bring forward the settlement of that place." In 1659 he removed to Northampton, Mass, of which he was one of the first and most active founders. He lived in Northampton for 40 years, and was a leading man in town and church affairs. His business as a tanner was prosperous. He owned, at different times, some two hundred acres of land in and around Northampton. He died in Northampton, Apr 14,1699, leaving about 160 descendants.<br />
 <br />
John Strong married (first) probably in England, Eleanor Deane, who died probably about 1635, and who, there is strong evidence to believe, was a daughter of William Deane, of Southcard, in the parish of Chard, Somersetshire, and a sisterof John and Walter Deane, of Taunton, Mass. "Elder" John Strong married (second), about 1636, Abigail Ford. "Plymouth Colony, its history & people 1620-1691, Eugene Aubrey Stratton, Ancestry Publishing, Salt Lake City, 1986. Taunton was originally called Cohanett. The first 7 free men were William Poole, John Gilbert, Sr., Henry Andrews, John Strong, John Deane, Walter Deane, and Edward Case. They were made freemen 4 Dec 1638. On 5 Mar 1638, Capt Poole was authorized to exercise the men at Cohanett in arms. On 1 Jun 1641, the General Court ordered that the first 7 freemen of Taunton, who had suffered great personal expense in traveling to attend the courts and in laying out lands to the town's inhabitants, should have some additional lands assigned them, provided the additions not exceed 40 acres apiece. He was one of 54 men on the list of those able to bear arms in 1643. (from p. 67) Will of William Deane of Southchard, Somerset, dated 22 Jul 1634, mentions daughter Margery Strong and grandson John Strong.<br />
 <br />
Eleanor, the wife of Walter Deane, was a daughter of John Strong of Chard, Somerset, and sister of John Strong of Northampton. (p. 279). John Strong sailed to New England from Dorset on 8 May 1635, with his family, aboard the Hopewell. (p.268) (NGSQ 71:173 ) The master of the Hopewell was John Driver, from Wymouth to Mass Bay.

 <br />
Had At Least 114 Grandchildren At Time Of Death<br />
 <br />
From The Mary and John by Kuhns: "After the death of John Strong's first wife, he married, probably before 1635, Abigail Ford, born Oct. 8, 1619, died July 6, 1688. In 1635, John Strong was at Hingham, Mass. In 1638, he was an inhabitant of Taunton, and he was Representative of Taunton at General Court in 1641-43-44. He removed to Northampton in 1659, where he became the first ruling elder of the Northampton Church. Jerijah Strong, the son of Elder John Strong, states that his father died April 13,1699, in the 92nd year of his age." (page 75)<br />
 <br />
Two generations of the Strong ancestry of John Strong, 1635 immigrant to Massachusetts, have been documented in STRONG FAMILY HISTORIES, Volume V, pages 629-639. His father was John Stronge; his grandfather was George Stronge. Both resided in the Parish of Chard, SomersetShire,England. John Strong, 2nd, was born there probably between 1605 and 1610, according to most estimations.<br />

If there is any motto belonging to the ensigns armorial of the Strongs, the author knows not what it is. It was early represented to him by some members of the family, that there was a motto handed down to us by our ancestors, for the ever new inspiration of manly virtue in our hearts; and a grand motto it was for the practical wisdom that it conveys:Tentanda est via! they said that it was; and i t is surely good enough to be written in letters of gold over the portals of any human pathway leading onwards and upwards. It has in it the sap and strength of adozen or more of our best proverbs, such as "Try again:" "Nothing venture nothing have:" "First be sure you are right, then go ahead:" "Whatever is worth doing at all is worth doing in the best manner possible:" "Practice makes perfect:" "Don't give up the ship:" "Faintheart never won fair lady:" "Perseverance conquers all things:" "Work and wait:" "Do or die: " "Real success is worth all that it costs." The author has put this motto fully to the proof in the preparation of this work: and he recommends it to all, young and old, as in valuable in the work of life, in the pursuit of whatever go o done may wish to obtain. He is sorry to be compelled to drop it as the family motto. It belongs to the Stronge Family of Lyman Abbey, a baronetcy created in the last century, whose crest is an eagle displayed with two heads, sable, beaked and legged, azure, langued, gules: motto, tentand a est via. This family may be connected in some way, as the resemblance of name and heraldic symbols would seem to suggest, with the Strong Family. If we cannot boast, as we would not if we could, of descent from the kings and nobles of other lands, we may well feel an honest pride in an ancestry whose wealth was wealth of character, and whose patent of nobility they obtained from above in following through storm and shine the footsteps of prophets and apostles and of the Son of God.<br />
 <br />
The Strong Family of England was originally located in the county of Shropshire. One of the family married an heiress of Griffith, of the county of Caernarvon, Wales, and went thither to reside in 1545. Richard Strong was of this branch of the family, and was born in the county of Caern arvon in 1561. In 1590 he removed to Taunton, Somersetshire, England, where he died in 1613, leaving a son John then eight years ofage, and a daughter Eleanor. The name is stated in one record, on what authority the writer knows not, to have been originally McStrachan and to have gone through the following changes, McStrachan, Strachan,Strachn, Strong. John Strong was born in Taunton, Eng., in 1605, whence he removed to London and afterwards to Plymouth. Having strong Puritan sympathies he sailed from Plymouth for the new world, March 20, 1630, in company with 140 persons, and among them Rev. Messrs. John Warham and John Maverick and Messrs. John Mason and Roger Clapp, in the ship Mary and John (Capt. Squeb) and arrived at Nantasket, Mass. (Hull), about twelve miles southeast from Boston, after a passage of more than seventy days in length, on Sunday, May 30, 1630.<br />
 <br />
The grandfather of Elder John Strong was, as tradition informs us, a Roman Catholic, and lived to a great age. The Strong Family has borne out remarkably, in its earlier generations in this country at any rate, the historical genuineness of its name, in its wide-spread characteristics of physical vigor and longevity, and the large size of very many of its numerous households.<br />
 <br />
Eleanor Strong came with her brother John to this country, when he was but twenty-five years of age, and she was probably several years younger, and married Walter Deane, a tanner, of Taunton, Mass.,previously of Taunton, Eng., and became the mother of four sons and one daughter. He was born about 1617, and was a prominent man in the affairs of his new home. Her descendants have been numerous and highly respectable. For various accounts of some of them se e N. E. Gen. Register, published at Boston in several volumes, in various places.<br />
In 1635, after having assisted in founding and developing the town of Dorchester, John Strong removed to Hingham, Mass., and on March 9, 1636, took the freeman's oath at Boston. His stay at Hingham was short, as on Dec. 4, 1638, he is found to have been an inhabitant and proprietor of Taunton, Mass., and to have been made in that year a freeman of Plymouth Colony. He remained at Taunton, as late at any rate as 1645, as he was a deputy thence to the General court in Plymouth, in 1641, '3, and '4. From Taunton he removed to Windsor, Ct., where he was appointed with four others, Capt. John Mason, Roger Ludlow, Israel Stoughton, and Henry Wolcott, all very leading men in the infant colony, "t o superintend and bring forward the settlement of that place," which had been settled a few years before (1636) by a portion of the same colony that with him had founded Dorchester. Windsor was in fact called at first, and for several years (1636-50), Dorchester.<br />
 <br />
In 1659 he removed from Windsor to Northampton, Mass., of which he was one of the first and most active founders, as he had been previously of Dorchester, Hingham, Taunton, and Windsor. In Northampton he lived for forty years, and was a leading man in the affairs of the town and of the church. He was a tanner and very prosperous in his business. His tannery was located on what is now the southwest corner of Market and Main streets near the railroad depot. He owned at different times, as appears by records in the county clerk's office, some two hundred acres of land in and around Northampton.<br />
 <br />
How he obtained his office and title as Elder John Strong will appear by the following quotation from the church records at Northampton: "After solemn and extraordinary seeking to God for his direction and blessing, the church chose John Strong ruling Elder, and William Holton, deacon. They were ordained 13: 3 mo: '63" (or, the year beginning then in March, June 13, 1663, O. S., or N.S. June 24, 1663), "the elder by the imposition of the hands of the pastor " (Rev. Eleazer Mather) "and Mr.Russell of Hadley - the deacon, afterwards by the imposition of the hands of the past or and elder. Mr. Russell, Mr. Goodwin, and brother Goodman were present from Hadley; Dea. Chapin and Mr. Holyoke from Springfield, who gave the right hand of fellowship to these delegates. "How near to the minister himself, so greatly revered, the ruling elder stood in the thoughts of our Pilgrim fathers, is manifest from the functions of his office, as described in the following church record under date of Sept. 11, 1672: "Solomon Stoddard was ordained pastor of the church in Northampton by Mr. John Strong, ruling elder, and Mr. John Whiting, pastor of the second church in Hartford."<br />
 <br />
His first wife, whose name and family the author has not been able to ascertain, he married in England. She died on the passage or soon after landing; and in about two months afterwards her infant offspring, a second child, died also. He married in December, 1630, for a second wife, Abigail Ford of Dorchester, Mass., with whom he lived in wedlock for fifty-eight years. She died, the mother of 16 children, July 6,1688, aged about 80; he died April 14, 1699 aged 94. He had had, up to the time of his decease, 160 descendants, viz: eighteen children, fifteen of whom had families; one hundred and fourteen grandchildren (6,John of Windsor; 16, Thomas of Northampton; 14, Jedediah; 7, Return; 10,Elder Ebenezer; 6, Abigail, Mrs. Chauncey; 12, Mrs. Joseph Parsons; 13, Mrs. Zerubbabel Filer; 8, Samuel; 11, Mary, Mrs. John Clark; 7, Hannah, Mrs. William Clark; 4, Hester, Mrs. Thomas Bissell); and thirty-three great grandchildren, at least.<br />
 <br />
He made over his lands in his life-time to his children, and took bills of those whom he had helped, beyond their share - as of Ebenezer, for land and rent Đ71 8s., of Samuel, for do. Đ49 12s. and of Jerijah, fordo. Đ60. He owed at his death, Đ61 11s., chiefly to his son Ebenezer - to which add for funeral expenses 40s., probate of will and inventory 7s.6d., and recording of same, 5s., and he had a free estate of Đ140. He gave to seven daughters Đ40 each, with what they had previously received. Abigail had had Đ38 13s.; Elizabeth, Đ36 7s.; Sarah, Đ28 1s.; Hannah, Đ2 8 12s.; Hester, Đ23 5s.; and Thankful, Đ16 7s. He gave to Experience Đ5 and to Catharine Chauncey (dau. of Abigail) Đ10 and to Rachel Strong (widow of Thomas) one acre in Northampton long improved by her husband. His sons, Samuel and Jerijah, were the executors of his will.<br />

From Wikipedia, 12 June 2006:<br />
 <br />
Trahaearn ap Caradog (died 1081) was a king of Gwynedd.<br />
 <br />
On the death of Bleddyn ap Cynfyn in 1075, it appears that none of his sons were old enough to claim the throne, and Bleddyn's cousin Trahaearn ap Caradog, seized power. The family is thought to have originated in Arwystli, on the border between Gwynedd and Powys. The same year Gruffydd ap Cynan landed on Anglesey with an Irish force, and with the assistance of the Norman Robert of Rhuddlan defeated Trahaearn and gained control of Gwynedd. However tension between Gruffydd's Irish bodyguard and the local Welsh led to a rebellion in Llyn and Trahaearn took the opportunity to counter attack, defeating Gruffydd at the battle of Bron yr Erw, also in 1075, and forcing him to flee back to Ireland.<br />
 <br />
In 1078 Trahaearn was campaigning in South Wales, defeating Rhys ab Owain of Deheubarth, who had been responsible for the killing of Bleddyn ap Cynfyn, in a battle at Gwdig. Rhys was forced to flee, and later the same year was killed by Caradog ap Gruffydd of Gwent. This was hailed in the annals Brut y Tywysogion as "vengeance for the blood of Bleddyn ap Cynfyn".<br />
 <br />
Trahaearn ruled Gwynedd until 1081, when Gruffydd ap Cynan returned from Ireland with an army of Danes and Irish and made an alliance with Rhys ap Tewdwr who had recently been ousted as prince of Deheubarth by Caradog ap Gruffydd of Morgannwg. Trahaearn countered by making an alliance with Caradog ap Gruffydd. He is also said to have had Norman arbalisters in his army, but at the Battle of Mynydd Carn, north of St David's, that year both Trahaearn and Caradog were killed, and Gruffydd ap Cynan took over the rule of Gwynedd while Rhys ap Tewdwr was restored as prince of Deheubarth. Trahaearn is recorded as having been killed by one of Gruffydd ap Cynan's men, an Irishman named Gucharki.<br />

Henry III (October 1, 1207 - November 16, 1272) is one of the least-knownBritish monarchs, considering the great length of his reign. He was alsothe first child monarch in English royal history.<br />
 <br />
He was born in 1207, the son of King John of England and Isabella of Angouleme. According to Nicholas Trevet, Henry was a thickset man of medium height, with a narrow forehead and a drooping left eyelid (inherited by his son, Edward I).<br />
 <br />
Following Johnʼs death in 1216, Henry, aged nine, was hastily crowned in Gloucester, as the barons who had been supporting the invasion of Prince Louis of France in order to ensure John's deposition quickly saw the young prince as a safer option. Henry's regents immediately declared their intention to rule by Magna Carta which they did during Henryʼs minority. Magna Carta was reissued in 1217 as a sign of goodwill to the barons. The country was ruled by regents until 1227.<br />
 <br />
When Henry reached maturity, however, he was keen to restore royal authority, looking towards the autocratic model of the French monarchy. Henry married Eleanor of Provence and he promoted many of his French relatives to power and wealth. For instance, one Poitevin, Peter des Riveaux, held the offices of treasurer of the household, keeper of the king's wardrobe, keeper of the privy seal, and the sheriffdoms of twenty-one English counties simultaneously. Henry's tendency to govern for long periods with no publicly appointed ministers who could be held accountable for their actions and decisions did not make matters any easier. Many English barons came to see his method of governing as foreign.<br />
 <br />
Henry himself, on the other hand, was much taken with the cult of the Anglo-Saxon saint king Edward the Confessor who had been canonized in 1161. Told that St Edward dressed austerely, Henry took to doing the same and wearing only the simplest of robes. He had a mural of the saint painted in his bedchamber for inspiration before and after sleep, and, of course, he named his eldest son after him. Henry designated Westminster, where St Edward had founded the abbey, as the fixed seat of power in England and Westminster Hall duly became the greatest ceremonial space of the kingdom, where the council of nobles also met. Henry appointed French architects from Rheims for the renovation of Westminster Abbey in Gothic style, and work began at great expense in 1245. The centrepiece of Henry's renovated Westminster Abbey was to be a shrine to the confessor king, Edward.<br />
 <br />
Henry was extremely pious, and his journeys were often delayed by his insistance on hearing Mass several times a day. He took so long to arrive on a visit to the French court that his brother-in-law, King Louis IX of France, banned priests from Henry's route. On one occasion, as related by Roger of Wendover, when King Henry met with papal prelates, he said, "If [the prelates] knew how much I, in my reverence of God, am afraid of them and how unwilling I am to offend them, they would trample on me as on an old and worn-out shoe."<br />
 <br />
Henry's advancement of foreign favorites, notably his wife's Savoyard uncles and his own Lusignan half-siblings, was unpopular among his subjects and barons. He was also extravagant and avaricious; when his first child, Prince Edward was born, Henry demanded the Londoners bring him rich gifts to celebrate, and even sent back gifts that did not please him. Matthew Paris reports that some said, "God gave us this child, but the king sells him to us."<br />

 <br />
Henry's reign came to be marked by civil strife, as the English barons led by de Montfort demanded more say in the running of the kingdom. French-born Simon de Montfort had originally been one of the foreign upstarts so loathed by many as Henry's foreign councillors; after he married Henryʼs sister Eleanor without consulting Henry, a feud developed between the two. Their relationship reached a crisis in the 1250s when de Montfort was put on trial for actions he took as lieutenant of Gascony, the last remaining Plantagenet land across the English Channel.<br />
 <br />
Henry also became embroiled in funding a war in Sicily on behalf of the Pope in return for a title for his second son Edmund, a state of affairs which made many barons fearful that Henry was following in the footsteps of his father and needed to be kept in check, just as King John had. De Montfort became leader of those who wanted to reassert Magna Carta and force the king to surrender more power to the baronial council. In 1258 seven leading barons forced Henry to agree to the Provisions of Oxford which effectively abolished the absolutist Anglo-Norman monarchy, giving power to a council of fifteen barons to deal with the business of government and providing for a three yearly meeting of parliament to monitor their performance.<br />
 <br />
Henry was forced to take part in the swearing of a collective oath to the Provisions of Oxford. In the following years, those supporting de Montfort and those supporting the king grew more and more polarised; Henry obtained a papal bull in 1261 exempting him from his oath and both sides began to raise armies, the Royalists under Edward Longshanks, Henry's eldest son. Civil War (known as the Second Barons' War) followed.<br />
 <br />
The charismatic de Montfort and his forces had captured most of southeastern England by 1263 and at the Battle of Lewes on May 14, 1264, Henry was defeated and taken prisoner by de Montfort's army. While Henry was reduced to a figurehead king, de Montfort broadened representation to include each county of England and many important towns - i.e. to groups beyond the nobility. Henry and Edward continued under house arrest. The short period which followed was the closest England was to come to complete abolition of the monarchy until the Commonwealth period of 1649-1660, and many of the barons who had initially supported de Montfort began to suspect that he had gone too far with his reforming zeal.<br />
 <br />
But only fifteen months later Edward Longshanks had escaped captivity to lead the royalists into battle again, and turned the tables on de Montfort at the Battle of Evesham in 1265. Following this victory savage retribution was exacted on the rebels.<br />
 <br />
Henry's shrine to Edward the Confessor was finally finished in 1269 and the saint's relics were installed. He died in 1272 and his body was lain temporarily in the tomb of the Confessor while his own sarcophagus was constructed in Westminster Abbey.<br />
 <br />
Henry was succeeded by his son, Edward I of England.<br />
 <br />
In the Divine Comedy Dante sees Henry ("the king of simple life") sitting outside the gates of Purgatory with other contemporary European rulers.<br />
 <br />
Marriage and children<br />
 <br />
Married on January 14, 1236, Canterbury Cathedral, Kent, England to Eleanor of Provence, with at least five children born:<br />
 <br />
   1. Edward I (1239-1307)<br />
   2. Margaret (1240-1275), married King Alexander III of Scotland<br />
   3. Beatrice (1242-1275), married to John II, Duke of Brittany<br />
   4. Edmund Crouchback (1245-1296)<br />
   5. Katharine (1253-1257)<br />
 <br />
Note: there is reason to doubt the existence of several attributed children of Henry and Eleanor. Richard, John, and Henry are known only from a 14th century addition made to a manuscript of Flores historiarum, and are nowhere contemporaneously recorded. William is an error for the nephew of Henry's half-brother, William de Valence. Another daughter, Matilda, is found only in the Hayles abbey chronicle, alongside such other fictitious children as a son named William for King John, and a bastard son named John for King Edward I. Matilda's existence is doubtful, at best. For further details, see Margaret Howell's The Children of King Henry III and Eleanor of Provence (1992).<br />

From Wikipedia<br />
 <br />
In Norse mythology, Sigmund was a hero whose story is told in Volsunga saga. He and his sister, Signy, are the children of Volsung. Sigmund is best known as the father of Sigurd the dragon-slayer, though Sigurd's tale has almost no connections to the Volsung tales.<br />
 <br />
In the Volsunga Saga, Signy marries Siggeir, the king of Gautland (i.e. modern Götaland and Beowulf's Geatland. However, in some English translations he is described as the king of the Goths). Volsung and Sigmund were attending the wedding feast (which lasted for some time before and after the marriage), when Odin, in the guise of a beggar, plunged a sword into the living tree around which Volsung's halls was built. The disguised Odin announced that the man who could remove the sword would have it as a gift. Only Sigmund was able to free the sword.<br />
 <br />
Siggeir is smitten with envy and desire for the sword. Siggeir invited Sigmund, his father Völsung and Sigmund's nine brothers to a visit in Gautland to see the newlyweds three months later. When the Völsung clan had arrived they were attacked by the Gauts (Geats) and king Völsung was killed and his sons captured. Signy beseached her husband to spare her brothers and to put them in stocks instead of killing them. As Siggeir thought that the brothers deserved to be tortured before they were killed, he agreed.<br />
 <br />
He then let his shape-shifting mother turn into a wolf and each night devour one of the brothers, until only Sigmund remained. Signy had a servant smear honey on the face of Sigmund and when the she-wolf arrived she started licking the honey off Sigmund's face. She licked and stuck her tongue into Sigmund's mouth whereupon Sigmund bit her tongue off, killing her. Sigmund then hid in the forests of Gautland and Signy brought him everything he needed.<br />
 <br />
Sigmund escaped his bonds and lived underground in the wilderness on Siggeir's lands. While he was in hiding, Signy came to him in the guise of a Völva (sorceress) and conceived a child by him Sinfjötli (the Fitela of Beowulf). Bent on revenge for their father's death, Signy sent her sons to Sigmund in the wilderness, one by one, to be tested. As each failed, Signy urged Sigmund to kill them. Finally, Sinfjötli (born of the incest between Signy and Sigmund) passed the test.<br />
 <br />
Sigmund and his son/nephew, Sinfjötli, grew wealthy as outlaws. In their wanderings, they came upon men sleeping in cursed wolf skins. Upon killing the men and wearing the wolf skins, Sigmund and Sinfjötli were cursed to a type of lycanthropy. Eventually, Sinfjötli and Sigmund avenged the death of Volsung.<br />
 <br />
After the death of Signy, Sigmund and Sinfjötli went harrying together. Sigmund married a woman named Borghild and had two sons, one of them named Helgi. Helgi and Sinfjötli ruled a kingdom jointly. Helgi married a woman named Sigrun after killing her father. Sinfjötli later killed Sigrun's brother in battle and Sigrun avenged her brother by poisoning Sinfjötli.<br />
 <br />
Later, Sigmund married a woman named Hjörd́ıs. After a short time of peace, Sigmund's lands were attacked by King Lyngi. While in battle, Sigmund matched up against an old man (Odin in disguise). Odin shattered Sigmund's sword, and Sigmund fell at the hands of others. Dying, Sigmund told Hjörd́ıs that she was pregnant and that her son would one day make a great weapon out of the fragments of his sword. That son was Sigurd.<br />
 <br />
Sigmund's story may be based on older material than that found in the Sigurd story and it is more directly involved in matters of family descent and the conquest of lands. If there is a historical person behind the Sigmund stories, it is probably a chieftain from the time of the first great Germanic migration in the second and third centuries CE.<br />

Notes:<br />
1) "William" Smythe should be JAMES WILSON Smythe.<br />
 <br />
2) Her marriage on 13 Oct 1913 was to Isaac Luthern Phinney, a widower with 3 sons, James E. Phinney and twins, Stewart Albert Phinney & Alfred D. Phinney (believe Alfred D. may have died young).<br />
 <br />
3) "Luther "Porter" is Luther Smythe PHINNEY from m/1 to Isaac Luthern Phinney.<br />
 <br />
4) "Irene" is Irene M. Phinney from m/1 to Isaac Luthern Phinney. Irene M. m/1 Harry Kempton Porter.<br />
 <br />
5) There was no mention of surviving siblings as I believe all predeceased Alice before 1955.<br />

According to the family tree drawn from memory by the elderly Frank G. Hutchinson for me around 1960, this Francis Hutchinson was married to "Hannah Ogilvie."

In Norse mythology, Volsung was the father of Sigmund. He was murdered by the Geatish king Siggeir.<br />
 <br />
Ironically, in Beowulf, when the Geatish warrior Beowulf has killed Grendel, a Danish bard at Hrothgar's court sings about Sigmund and his father Waels.<br />
 <br />
Synopsis<br />
 <br />
Völsung was the great-grandson of Odin himself, and it was Odin who made sure that Völsung would be born. Völsung's parents who were the king and queen of the Huns could not have any children until Odin and his consort Frigg sent them a giantess named Ljod carrying the apple of fertility. Völsung's father died shortly after this but his wife was pregnant for six years, until she had had enough. She commanded that the child be delivered with a caesarian, an operation that in those days cost the life of the mother. Völsung was a strong child and he kissed his mother before she died.<br />
 <br />
He was immediately proclaimed king of the Huns and when he had grown up he married the giantess Ljod. First they had two twins, the girl Signy and her twin brother named Sigmund. After the twins they had nine more sons.<br />
 <br />
Völsung built himself a great hall in the centre of which stood a large apple tree. Siggeir, the King of the Geats, soon arrived and proposed to Signy. Both Völsung and his sons approved, but Signy was less enthusiastic.<br />
 <br />
A great wedding was held in the hall, when suddenly a stranger appeared. He was a tall old man with only one eye. He went to the apple tree took his sword and stuck it deep into the trunk. Odin told everyone that the sword was meant for the man who could pull the sword from the apple tree. Then he vanished.<br />
 <br />
Everyone at the wedding tried to pull the sword but only Sigmund succeeded, and he did so effortlessly. The sword was named Gram and it proved to be an excellent weapon. Siggeir, his father-in-law, offered thrice its weight in gold for the sword, but Sigmund scornfully said no. This greatly angered Siggeir who returned home the next day.<br />
 <br />
Three months later, Völsung and his sons were invited to banquet with Siggeir. They were met by Signy who warned them that Siggeir intended to ambush them. They refused to turn back whereupon Signy cried and implored them to go home. Soon they were attacked by the Geats, Völsung fell and his ten sons were taken captive.<br />

Ramiro II of Aragon 'the Monk' (ca. 1075 - August 16, 1154, at Huesca) was a king of Aragon (1134-1137).<br />
 <br />
In 1134, when his brother Alfonso I of Aragon 'the Battler' died heirless, Ramiro was bishop of Barbastro-Roda. He temporarily gave up his monastic vows in order to secure the succession to the crown. Although Ramiro had to put up with the loss of Navarre, which had formed part of his late brother's dominions but in 1134 became independent under Garćıa Raḿırez, he fought off two other claimants to the throne, one Pedro de Atarés, an illegitimate connection of the royal line, and Alfonso VII of Castile.<br />
 <br />
The reign of Ramiro the Monk, as he is known, only lasted three years - just enough for him to put down his nobles' rebellion, marry Agnes of Poitiers, daughter of William IX of Aquitaine, produce a heiress, Petronila, betrothe her (aged two) to Ramon Berenguer IV of Catalonia, abdicate in her favour and return to monastic life.<br />

n Norse mythology, Brynhildr (German: Brünnehilde) was a shieldmaiden anda valkyrie. According to the Volsungasaga, she is the daughter of Budliand brother of Atli (Attila the Hun). She was ordered to decide a fightin between two kings, Hjalmgunnar and Agnar. The valkyrie knew that Odinhimself preferred the older king, Hjalmgunnar, yet Brynhild decided thebattle for Agnar. For this Odin condemned the valkyrie to live the lifeof a mortal woman and cursed her to sleep until any man would rescue andmarry her. Brynhild was imprisoned in a ring of fire that only thegreatest hero could enter. Sigurd (Siegfried), the son of Sigmund,entered that ring after killing the dragon Fafnir and awoke Brynhild.Later Sigurd gave her his ring, Andvarinaut.<br />
 <br />
Sigurd duly betrayed her and married Gudrun when bewitched by the sorceress Grimhild to forget Brynhild. Gudrun's brother, Gunnar, then sought to court Brynhild but was stopped by the ring of fire that still surrounded her. Sigurd exchanged shapes with him and entered the ring of fire a second time. He then took the ring Andvarinaut from her finger and gave it to Gudrun. Gunnar and Brynhild married, but she realised Sigurd's betrayal when she saw Gudrun wearing the Andvarinaut and then plotted to have him killed. Her brother-in-law Guttorm killed Sigurd, Brynhild herself killed Sigurd's three-year-old son, and then she willed herself to die.<br />
 <br />
Brynhild bore Sigurd a daughter, Aslaug, who later married Ragnar Lodbrok.<br />

Killed in battle at EveshamThe first of this family that settled inEngland was Simon de Montfort, surnamed the Bald, great grandson ofAlmaric, an illegitimate son of Robert,* King of France. Which Simonhaving m. Amicia, one of the two sisters and co-heirs of Robert deBellemont, or Beaumont, surnamed Fitz-Parnel, 4th and last Earl ofLeicester of that family, obtained a grant of the Earldom of Leicesterfrom King John, with a confirmation of the Stewardship of England, whichhe acquired by the possession of the honour of Hinkley, a portion of theimmense fortune of his wife. But notwithstanding these marks of royalfavour, the earl, within a brief period, revolted from the King ofEngland to the King of France, for which act of treason the Earldom ofLeicester was transferred to Ranulph, Earl of Chester, the honours ofHinkley seized upon by the crown, and de Montfort himself banished therealm. Soon after this (1209), we find him under the title of Earl ofMontfort, general of the crusade against the Albigenses, and in nineyears subsequently a leader in the besieging arms of Lewis, King ofFrance, before the walls of Toulouse where he was slain by a slinger fromthe battlements. His lordship had two sons by the co-heiress of Beaumont,namely, Almaric and Simon.<br />

 <br />
It was Simon's father (also Simon) who married Amicia de Bellemont as his 2nd wife and mother of this Simon.<br />
 <br />
Simon de Montfort, b. 1165?--d. June 25, 1218, Toulouse, Fr., French leader of the Albigensian Crusade declared by Pope Innocent III against the Cathari, an unorthodox religious group in southern France.In 1190 Montfort married Alice de Montmorency (died 1221). During the Fourth Crusade (1202-04) he participated in the siege of Zara and later fought in Syria. Beginning in 1209 he led the fight against the Cathari (better known as Albigenses after the town of Albi) in a crusade that quickly became a war of conquest by the northern French against the nobility of the south. Having conquered Béziers and Carcassonne, he was chosen to govern those lands. When most of the crusaders departed after the 40-day term they had promised to serve, he was left with large territories still to conquer. After he had won the important Battle of Muret in 1213, the lands of Raymond VI, count of Toulouse, were adjudged to Montfort by the fourth Lateran Council (1215) because of Raymond's failure to root out heretics. He now styled himself count of Toulouse, viscount of Béziers and Carcassonne, and duke of Narbonne, but Raymond did not accept defeat. He occupied Toulouse in September 1217. Montfort was killed while besieging the city. His son Amaury (died 1241) soon abandoned the crusade and ceded the Montfort lands in southern France to King Louis VIII. [Encyclopædia Britannica CD '97]<br />
 <br />
From Wikipedia<br />
 <br />
Simon de Montfort, 5th Earl of Leicester, also Simon IV de Montfort (1160 - June 25, 1218) was a French nobleman who took part in the Fourth Crusade (1202 - 1204) and was a prominent leader of the Albigensian Crusade. He died at the siege of Toulouse in 1218.<br />
 <br />
He was the son of Simon III de Montfort, descended from the lords of Montfort l'Amaury in France near Paris, and Amicia de Beaumont. He succeeded his father as Baron de Montfort in 1181; in 1190 he married Alix de Montmorency, the daughter of Bouchard III de Montmorency. In 1191 his brother, Guy, left on the Third Crusade in the retinue of King Philip II of France.<br />
 <br />
In 1199, while taking part in a tournament at Ecry-sur-Aisne, he heard Fulk of Neuilly preaching the crusade, and in the company of Count Thibaud de Champagne, he took the cross. The crusade soon fell under Venetian control, and was diverted to Zara on the Adriatic Sea. Pope Innocent III had specifically warned the Crusaders not to attack fellow Christians; Simon tried to reassure the citizens of Zara that there would be no attack, but nevertheless, the city was sacked in 1202. Simon did not participate in this action, and soon he left the Crusade altogether. Afterwards, under Venetian guidance the Crusaders sacked the city of Constantinople-the main trading rival to Venice.<br />
 <br />
His mother was the eldest daughter of Robert de Beaumont, 3rd Earl of Leicester. After the death of her brother Robert de Beaumont, 4th Earl of Leicester without children in 1204, she inherited half of his estates, and a claim to the Earldom of Leicester. The division of the estates was effected early in 1207, by which the rights to the earldom were assigned to Amicia and Simon. However, King John of England took possession of the lands himself in February 1207, and confiscated it's revenues. Later, in 1215, the lands were passed into the hands of Simon's nephew, Ranulph de Meschines, 4th Earl of Chester.<br />
 <br />
Simon remained on his estates in France, where in 1208 he was made captain-general of the French forces in the Albigensian Crusade. Simon was given the territory conquered from Raymond VI of Toulouse. He became notorious and feared for his extreme cruelty, massacring whole towns, and for his "treachery, harshness, and bad faith." He was a man of extreme religious orthodoxy, deeply commited to the Dominican order and the suppression of heresy. In 1213 he defeated Peter of Aragon at the Battle of Muret. The Albigensians were now crushed, but Simon carried on the campaign as a war of conquest, being appointed lord over all the newly-acquired territory as Count of Toulouse and Duke of Narbonne (1215). He occupied himself in waging war at N̂ımes, until in 1217 a rebellion broke out in Provence, where Count Raymond's son re-entered Toulouse. Simon hastened to besiege the city, and was killed on 25 June 1218 while fighting a sally by the besiegers. He was buried in the Monastery of Haute-Bruyère.<br />

Simon left three sons: his French estates passed to his eldest son, Amaury de Montfort, while his younger son, Simon, eventually gained possession of the earldom of Leicester and played a major role in the reign of Henry III of England. Another son, Guy, died at the seige of Castelnaudary in 1220. His daughter, Petronilla, became an abbess at the Cistercian nunnery of St. Antoine's. Another daughter, Amicia, founded the nunnery at Montargis and died there in 1252.<br />

George Barton Simpson, who opened a law office in Vancouver in 1907 andwent on to become chief justice of the Washington State Supreme Court,was a man who never could seem to do enough for his community.<br />
Simpson's list of achievements went far beyond the legal field. During his almost half-century of residency here, he was at various times a founder of the local Boy Scout movement, founder and president of the Clark county golf and Country Club, first chairman of the Clark County Game Commission and a leader in numerous other civic and service organizations.<br />
Because of his long work with the Boy Scouts, Simpson was awarded the Silver Beaver, Scouting's highest honor. Another indication of his interest in youth was the fact as juvenile court judge he helped reduce the rate of juvenile appearances in court from 12 percent in 1932 percent to 3.2 percent in 1936.<br />
Simpson also is credited with having initiated the local trout hatchery.<br />
Born Aug. 12, 1881, in Pomeroy, Wash., Simpson came to Vancouver in 1907 right after graduation from the Willamette University School of Law. He was elected Vancouver City attorney in 1915 and in three years in that position never lost a case.<br />
In 1920, Simpson became a judge of the Superior Court and held this position until 1937 when he was appointed to the state Supreme Court. He was elected in 1938 and again in 1944 and served two terms as chief justice.<br />
In the election of 1950, Simpson finally was defeated for re-election. He returned to Vancouver, where he practiced law with his son Donald, until his death in June of 1954 at age 72.<br />

Hugh III of Burgundy (1142-August 25, 1192, in Acre) was duke of Burgundybetween 1162 and 1192. Hugh was the eldest son of duke Eudes II and Marieof Blois. He was married twice, first to Beatrice d'Albon, then to Aliceof Lorraine (daughter of duke Matthias I), and had several sons anddaughters.<br />
 <br />
The rule of Hugh III marked the ending of a period of relative peace in the duchy of Burgundy. Hugh was a belligerent man and soon was involved in conflicts against king Louis VII of France over their borders. When Philip Augustus succeeded Louis in 1180, Hugh seized the opportunity and forced several men to change alliance to Burgundy. Philip II was not happy with the loss of his vassals and invaded the duchy, besieging Chatillon. The town fell and with it, its garrison, commanded by Eudes, Hugh's heir. A peace was negotiated and Hugh had to pay a high ransom for his son and give up ambitions over French territory.<br />
 <br />
Hugh then turned his energies to the Holy Land, embarking in the Third Crusade in the retinue of Philip II. He was the most trusted ally of Richard, the Lionheart and fought with him against Saladin. When Philip returned to France, he left Hugh in charge of the French troops. Hugh played a major role in the victory of the battle of Arsuf (September 7, 1191) and the conquer of Acre, where he died in the following year.<br />
 <br />
In 1187, Hugh transferred the capital of Burgundy to Dijon, and endeavoured to turn the city into a major commercial centre.<br />

Owain ap Hywel (died 987) was king of Deheubarth in south Wales and probably also controlled Powys.<br />
 <br />
Owain was the son of Hywel Dda, originally king of Deheubarth but by the end of his life king of most of Wales. On Hywel's death in 950 Deheubarth was shared between Owain and his two brothers, Rhodri and Edwin. The sons of Hywel were not able to keep hold of Gwynedd, which was reclaimed for the traditional dynasty of Aberffraw by Iago ab Idwal and Ieuaf ab Idwal, the sons of Idwal Foel.<br />
 <br />
In 952 Iago and Ieuaf invaded the south, penetrating as far as Dyfed. The sons of Hywel retaliated by invading the north in 954, reaching as far north as the Conwy valley before being defeated in a battle at Llanrwst and being obliged to retreat to Ceredigion.<br />
 <br />
Rhodri died in 953 and Edwin in 954, leaving Owain to rule Deheubarth alone. Owain did not again try to reclaim Gwynedd, but instead he and his son Einon turned eastwards to attack the kingdom of Morgannwg (modern Glamorgan) in 960, 970 and 977. Owain was now ageing, and it appears that Einon took over the rule of the kingdom on behalf of his father. On a further raid on the east in 984, Einon was killed by the noblemen of Gwent.<br />
 <br />
Following Einon's death, Owain's second son, Maredudd, took over the leadership in war, and in 986 did what his father had failed to do by seizing the throne of Gwynedd, ousting Ieuaf's son Cadwallon ab Ieuaf. The following year Owain died and Maredudd became king of Deheubarth as well as Gwynedd.<br />

Howell the Good (c.880?-950; Welsh: Hywel Dda or Hywel ap Cadell) is listed amongst the kings of Gwynedd. He is remembered as one of the most successful native Welsh rulers prior to the Norman Conquest. As a result of his reign, Wales ended the 10th century with a set of codified laws considerably more sophisticated than those of contemporary England.<br />
 <br />
Howell was born in around 880, the younger son of Cadell ap Rhodri, himself the son of Rhodri the Great. In 905, Cadell, having conquered Dyfed, gave it to his son to rule on his behalf. Howell was able to consolidate his position by marrying Elen, whose father had ruled Dyfed until his death. Following his father's death in 909, he acquired a share of Seisyllwg, and on his brother's death in 920, he merged Dyfed and Seisyllwg, creating for himself a new kingdom, which became known as Deheubarth. Following the death of a cousin in 942, he also inherited the principality of Gwynedd, becoming ruler of about three-quarters of present-day Wales.<br />
 <br />
Howell's reign, uncharacteristically for the time, was a peaceful one, and he achieved an understanding with Athelstan of England. Such was the relationship between the neighbouring countries that Howell was able to mint his own coinage in the English city of Chester. He was the only Welsh ruler ever to produce coinage. His study of the English legal system and his visit to Rome in 928 (on a pilgrimage) combined to enable him to formulate advanced ideas about government. (He would possibly have a chance to meet either of the Popes John X, Leo VI and Stephen VIII who were active during that year).<br />
 <br />
The conference held at Whitland in about 945, was a kind of parliament in which Welsh law was codified and set down in writing for posterity, much of the work being done by the celebrated clerk, Blegywryd. Following Howell's death, his kingdom was soon split into three and divided between his sons. However, his legacy endured in the form of his enlightened laws, which remained in active use throughout Wales until the conquest.<br />

 <br />
He succeeded his father Ramon Berenguer I, Count of Barcelona to co-rule with his twin brother Berenguer Ramon, in 1075.<br />
 <br />
The twins failed to agree and divided their possessions between them, against the will of their late father. Ramon Berenguer the Towhead, called so because of the thickness and colour of his hair, was killed while hunting in the woods in 1082. His brother, who went on to become the sole ruler of Catalonia, was credited by popular opinion of having orchestrated this murder. Berenguer Ramon the Fratricide was later succeeded by Ramon Berenguer's son Ramon Berenguer III.<br />

 <br />
Brecon Castle, Aberhonddu (Powys) is associated with the Norman occupation of the area, and in particular with Bernard de Neufmarche who ousted Rhys ap Tewdwr in 1093 and soon afterwards established his rule over the area with the raising of a motte-and-bailey on the confluence of the Honddu and the Usk, and at some distance from the Roman fort. Neufmarche founded the Benedictine priory, and its church, St John's in the first decade of the 12th century. [The Castles of Wales, p. 40-41]<br />
 <br />
As was the custom under the Norman feudal system, Bernard Newmarch divided the land of Bycheiniog between himself and his chief followers; and these became in course of time, through intermarriage with the Welsh, more than Norman. A large portion of William the Conqueror's forces were pure or mixed Celts from Brittany, Normandy, and elsewhere. Many of them were descendants of Cynry from Wales, who had sought refuge and settlement in Brittany during the Saxon and Danish troubles; and it is more than probable that some of Newmarch's companions were of this description, and only restored the purity of their Celtic blood by alliances with the people of Brycheiniog. The example of marrying into Welsh families was set by Bernard Newmarch himself, who took to wife the notorious Nest, daughter of Trahaearn ap Caradog, and niece of Llywelyn ap Seissyllt.<br />

Ramon Berenguer III the Great was Count of Barcelona, Girona and Osona from 1082-1131 and Count of Provence, Holy Roman Empire, from 1112.<br />
 <br />
Born in 1082 in Rodez, he was the son of Ramon Berenguer II. He succeeded his father to co-rule with his uncle Berenguer Ramon II. After 1097, when Berenguer Ramon II was forced into exile, he was the sole ruler.<br />
 <br />
During his rule Catalan interests were extended on both sides of the Pyrenees. By marriage or vassalage he incorporated into his realm almost all of the Catalan counties (except those of Urgell and Peralada). He inherited the counties of Besalú (1111) and Cerdagne (1117) and in between married Douce, heiress of Provence (1112). Now his dominions stretched as far east as Nice.<br />
 <br />
In alliance with the Count of Urgell Ramon Berenguer conquered Barbastro and Balaguer. In 1118 he captured and rebuilt Tarragona, which became the metropolitan seat of the church in Catalonia (before that, Catalans had depended ecclesiastically on the archbishopric of Narbonne). He also established relations with the Italian maritime republics of Pisa and Genoa and in 1114-1115 raided with them the Moorish pirate strongholds of Majorca and Ibiza. They became his tributaries and many Christian slaves were recovered and set free. Jointly with Pisa Ramon Berenguer also raided Muslim dependencies on the mainland, including lands of Valencia, Lleida and Tortosa.<br />
 <br />
Toward the end of his life Ramon Berenguer became a Templar. He gave his five Catalonian counties to his eldest son Ramon Berenguer IV and Provence to the younger son Berenguer Ramon.<br />

Petronila of Aragon<br />
From Wikipedia<br />
 <br />
Petronila of Aragon (1135- October 17, 1174, Barcelona) was the daughter of King Ramiro II of Aragon and Agnes of Poitiers, a.k.a. Agnes of Aquitaine. (Petronila is also referred to by various sources as "Petronilla", "Petronilla Raḿırez", "Pétronille", or "Petronella").<br />
 <br />
In 1134, when his brother Alfonso I of Aragon died heirless, Ramiro was bishop of Barbastro-Roda. He was given papal dispensation to abdicate his monastic vows in order to secure the succession to the throne. King Ramiro the Monk, as he is known, married Agnes of Poitiers, produced an heiress, Petronila, bethrothed her (aged two) to Ramon Berenguer IV of Catalonia, abdicated in her favour and returned to monastic life.<br />
 <br />
The Aragonese monarchy had previously passed only to males, thus Petronila's succession was an exception at the time. Bastardy was not an impediment of succession in Aragon, the ancestor of this line, Ramiro I of Aragon having been a bastard. The heir in male line, Garcia VI of Navarre, was genealogically relatively distant, son of Ramiro II's second cousin. Petronila's succession created a new case in succession custom in Aragon.<br />
 <br />
Petronila married Ramon Berenguer in 1150. While he was alive, they nominally ruled their possessions separately, although the count had the final say over both Aragon and Catalonia. Upon his death Petronila renounced the crown of Aragon in favour of her eldest son Ramon, who, in compliment to the Aragonese, changed his name to Alfonso. Alfonso II of Aragon, I of Barcelona was the first ruler of both Aragon and Catalonia. This effected the dynastic union between the two countries that was to last until their incorporation in the kingdom of Spain in 1707.<br />

Llywelyn ap Seisyll (died 1023) was a King of Gwynedd and of Deheubarth in north-west and south-west Wales.<br />
 <br />
Little is known about Llywelyn's father Seisyll, who may not have been of royal blood, though Llywelyn's mother Angharad was the daughter of Maredydd ab Owain, who ruled much of both northern and southern Wales for a period.<br />
 <br />
Llywelyn won control of Gwynedd in 1018 when he defeated Aeddan ap Blegywryd in battle, killing him and his four sons. He later gained control of Deheubarth, defeating Rhain, an Irish pretender who claimed to be the son of Maredydd ab Owain, at Abergwili in 1022. According to the annals in Brut y Tywysogion, Llywelyn's reign was a period of prosperity, "there was no one needy in his realm, and there was no town empty or deserted". His reign was cut short by his premature death in 1023.<br />
 <br />
His son, Gruffydd ap Llywelyn, though still a youth when his father died, was later able to gain control of almost the whole of Wales.<br />

Eleanor of Provence (c 1223 - 26 June 1291) was Queen Consort of King Henry III of England.<br />
 <br />
Born in Aix-en-Provence, she was the daughter of Ramon Berenguer IV, Count of Provence (1198-1245) and Beatrice of Savoy (1206-1266), the daughter of Tomasso, Count of Savoy and his second wife Marguerite of Geneva. All four of their daughters became queens. Like her mother, grandmother, and sisters, Eleanor was renowned for her beauty. Eleanor was probably born in 1223; Matthew Paris describes her as being "jamque duodennem" (presently twelve) when she arrived in England for her marriage.<br />
 <br />
Eleanor was married to Henry III, King of England (1207-1272) on January 14, 1236. She had never seen him prior to the wedding at Canterbury Cathedral and had never set foot in his impoverished kingdom. Edmund Rich, Archbishop of Canterbury, officiated. Eleanor and Henry had five children:<br />
   1. Edward I (1239-1307)<br />
   2. Margaret (born 1240), married King Alexander III of Scotland<br />
   3. Beatrice (born 1242), married John II, Duke of Brittany<br />
   4. Edmund Crouchback (born 1245)<br />
   5. Katharine (born 1253-May 3, 1257)<br />
 <br />
Eleanor seems to have been especially devoted to her eldest son, Edward; when he was deathly ill in 1246, she stayed with him at the abbey at Beaulieu for three weeks, long past the time allowed by monastic rules. It was due to her influence that King Henry granted the duchy of Gascony to Edward in 1249. Her youngest child, Katharine, seems to have had a degenerative disease that rendered her mute. When she died aged four, both her royal parents suffered overwhelming grief.<br />
 <br />
She was a confident consort to Henry, but she brought in her retinue a large number of cousins, "the Savoyards," and her influence with the King and her unpopularity with the English barons created friction during Henry's reign. Eleanor was devoted to her husband's cause, stoutly contested Simon de Montfort, raising troops in France for Henry's cause. On July 13, 1263, she was sailing down the Thames on a barge when her barge was attacked by citizens of London. In fear for her life, Eleanor was rescued by Thomas FitzThomas, the mayor of London, and took refuge at the bishop of London's home.<br />
 <br />
In 1272 Henry died, and her son Edward, 33 years old, became Edward I, King of England. She stayed on in England as Dowager Queen, and raised several of her grandchildren -- Edward's son Henry and daughter Eleanor, and Beatrice's son John. When her grandson Henry died in her care in 1274, Eleanor mourned him and his heart was buried at the priory at Guildford she founded in his memory. Eleanor retired to a convent but remained in touch with her son and her sister, Marguerite.<br />
 <br />
Eleanor died in 1291 in Amesbury, England.<br />

William X of Aquitaine (1099 - April 9, 1137), nicknamed the Saint was Duke of Aquitaine and Gascony and Count of Poitiers as William VIII of Poitiers between 1126 and 1137. He was the son of William, the Troubador by his wife, Philippa of Toulouse.<br />
 <br />
William was born in Toulouse during the brief period when his parents ruled the capitol. Later that same year, much to his wife's ire, Duke William mortgaged Toulouse to Philippa's cousin, Bertrand of Toulouse, and then left on Crusade. Philippa and her infant son were left in Poitiers. When Duke William returned, he took up with Dangereuse, the wife of one of his vassals, and set aside his rightful wife, Philippa. This caused conflict between father and son, until William married Ænor of Châtellerault, daughter of his father's mistress, in 1121. He had from her three children: William Aigret, who died young; the heiress Eleanor of Aquitaine; and Petronilla of Aquitaine, who married Raoul I of Vermandois. Both Ænor and William Aigret died in 1130.<br />
 <br />
As his father before him, William X was a patron of troubadors, music and literature. He was an educated man and strived to give his two daughters an excellent education, in a time when Europe's rulers were hardly literate. When Eleanor succeeded him as Duchess, she continued William's tradition and transformed the Aquitanian court into Europe's centre of knowledge.<br />
 <br />
Despite his love of the arts, William was not a peaceful man, and was frequently involved in conflicts with neighbouring Normandy (which he raided in 1136) and France. Even inside his borders, William faced an alliance of the Lusignans and the Parthenays against him, an issue resolved with total destruction of the enemies. In international politics, William X initially supported antipope Anacletus II in the schism of 1130, opposite to Pope Innocent II, against the will of his own bishops. In 1134 Saint Bernard of Clairvaux convinced William to drop his support to Anacletus and join Innocent.<br />
 <br />
In 1137 William joined the pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela, but died of food poisoning during the trip. On his deathbed, he expressed his wish to see king Louis VII of France as protector of his fifteen year old daughter Eleanor. Louis VII accepted this wish and married the heiress of Aquitaine.<br />

From Wikipedia<br />
 <br />
Ramon Berenguer I el Vell ("the Old") was Count of Barcelona in 1035-1076. He promulgated the earliest versions of a written code of Catalan law, the Usages of Barcelona.<br />
 <br />
Born in 1024, he succeeded his father, Berenguer Ramon the Crooked in 1035. It is during his reign that the dominant position of Barcelona among other Catalan counties became evident.<br />
 <br />
Ramon Berenguer campaigned against the Moors, extending his dominions as far west as Barbastro and imposing heavy tributes (parias) on other Moorish cities. Historians claim that those tributes helped create the first wave of prosperity in Catalan history. During his reign Catalan maritime power started to be felt in Western Mediterranean. Ramon Berenguer the Old was also the first count of Catalonia to acquire lands (counties of Carcassonne and Razés) and influence north of the Pyrenees.<br />
 <br />
Another major achievement of his was beginning of codification of Catalan law in the written Usatges or Usatici of Barcelona which was to become the first full compilation of feudal law in Western Europe. Legal codification was part of the count's efforts to forward and somehow control the process of feudalization which started during the reign of his weak father, Berenger Ramon. Another major contributor was the Church acting through the institution of the Peace and Truce of God. This established a general truce among warring factions and lords in a given region for a given time. The earliest extant date for introducing the Truce of God in Western Europe is 1027 in Catalonia, during the reign of Ramon Berenguer the Old.<br />
 <br />
He was succeeded by his twin sons Ramon Berenguer II and Berenguer Ramon II.<br />

William IX of Aquitaine (October 22, 1071 - February 10, 1126, alsoGuillaume or Guilhem d'Aquitaine), nicknamed the Troubador was Duke ofAquitaine and Gascony and Count of Poitiers as William VII of Poitiersbetween 1086 and 1126. He was also one of the leaders of the crusade of1101 and one of the first vernacular poets and troubadours.<br />
 <br />
Life and Family<br />
William was the son of William VIII of Aquitaine by his third wife Hildegarde of Burgundy. His birth was an event of great celebration, but at first he was considered illegitimate by religious authorities because of his father's earlier divorces and his parents consanguinity. This obliged his father to make a pilgrimage to Rome soon after his birth, where he sought and received papal approval of his marriage and children.<br />
 <br />
In 1094 he married Philippa of Toulouse, the daughter and heiress of William IV of Toulouse. By Philippa, William had:<br />
    * William X of Aquitaine, his heir.<br />
    * Agnes of Aquitaine, who married (1) Aimery V of Thouars; (2) to King Ramiro II of Aragon<br />
    * Henry, abbot of Cluny<br />
    * Raymond of Poitiers, ruler of the principality of Antioch, a crusader state<br />
 <br />
He was excommunicated twice, the first time in 1114 for some unknown offense. His response to this was to demand absolution from the Bishop of Poitiers at swordpoint. He was excommunicated the second time for carrying off Dangereuse, the wife of his vassal Aimery I de Rochefoucauld, Viscount of Châtellerault. He installed her in the Maubergeonne tower of his castle, and, as related by William of Malmesbury, even painted a picture of her on his shield.<br />
 <br />
This greatly offended both his wife and his son, William. According to Orderic Vitalis, Philippa protested her treatment in October 1119 at the Council of Reims, claiming to have been abandoned by the duke in favor of Dangereuse. She later retired to the convent of Fontevrault. Relations were only patched up with his son when the younger William married Ænor of Châtellerault, Dangereuse's daughter by her husband.<br />
 <br />
His 13th century Provençal biographer remembers him:<br />
    "[William IX] was one of the most courtly men in the world and one of the greatest deceivers of women. He was a fine knight at arms, liberal in his attentions to ladies, and a fine composer and singer of songs."<br />
 <br />
Military life<br />
William invited Pope Urban II to spend Christmas 1095 at his court. The pope urged him to take the cross and leave for the Holy Land, but William was more interested in exploiting the absence of Raymond IV of Toulouse, his wife's uncle, to press a claim to Toulouse. He and Philippa did capture Toulouse in 1098, an act for which they were threatened with excommunication. Partly out of a desire to regain favor with the religious authorities and partly out of a wish to see the world, William joined the First Crusade in 1099.<br />
 <br />
He arrived in the Holy land in 1101 and stayed there until the following year. His record as a general is not very impressive. William fought mostly skirmishes in Anatolia and was frequently defeated. His recklessness had his army ambushed on several occasions, with great losses to his own side. In September 1101 his entire army was destroyed by the Turks at Heraclea; William himself barely escaped with a few survivors.<br />
 <br />
Later on in his life, William joined forces with the kingdoms of Castile (an old ally) and Léon. Between 1120 and 1123, Aquitanian troops fought side by side with queen Urraca of Castile, in an effort to conquer the Moors of Cordoba and complete the Reconquista. During his sojourn in Spain, William was given a rock crystal vase by a Muslim ally that he later beqeathed to his granddaughter Eleanor. The vase probably originated in Sassanid Persia in the 7th century.<br />
 <br />
William IX also provided troops to Philip I of France in his war against William the Conqueror.<br />
 <br />
Poetry<br />
William's greatest legacy to history was not as a warrior but as a man of the arts. He was one of the first European lyric poets and used vernacular language in his songs and poems. Eleven of his songs are the earliest troubadour poems that have survived into the 21st century (Merwin, 2002). His artistic name was lo cons de Peitieus, and he was one of the most important troubadours of the Middle Age's Provençal literature. The topics of these were very diverse, but the majority is about sex, love and women and often about his own sexual prowesses. This choice of subject in a world used to music only for the praise of God and heroes caused scandal and admiration at the same time. In the next few centuries, troubadours and vernacular poetry would be fashionable and the most important artistic movement of the Middle Ages.<br />
 <br />
William was a man that loved scandal and no doubt enjoyed shocking his audiences. In the return from the crusade, he abandoned his wife in favour of a married woman, known as Dangereuse from his poems, and faced the risk of excommunication for the deed. He also composed a song about constructing a convent in his lands, where the nuns would be picked among the most beautiful women in the region. The fake nunnery project was abandoned and William ended by giving enormous donations to the church, perhaps to regain the pope's favour. He also constructed the palace of Poitou.<br />
 <br />
One of William's poems is a musing on mortality; it begins: Since now I have a mind to sing/I'll make a song of that which saddens me, and goes on to say: For I have known delight and dalliance/Both far and near, yea and in my own dwelling/But this day, joy and dalliance, farewell. He died in 1126.<br />

Gonzalo Fernández, Count of Burgos (ca. 899-915) and of Castile (c.909-915).<br />
Recorded for the first time in 899 as Count of Burgos, soon the region expanded to the eastern mountain valleys enabling Gonzalo to make his fort base in Lara, thus stretching his rule from the foot of the Cantabrian Mountains around Espinosa de los Monteros to the river Arlanza, which therefore became the border with the neighbouring Muslim territories. In order to stretch his territory this far, he first had to displace the Muslim forces based at the stronghold of Carazo that dominated the area and access. This was achieved after a long and well contested struggle.<br />
The valley of Lara was then the rallying point of the family that - years later - achieved through his son, Fernan Gonzalez the quasi-independence of Castile, securing the area for five generations with the family until it became a kingdom under Fernando I of Castile of the Jimenez dynasty.<br />
His name appears for the first time in charter of the Monastery of San Pedro de Cardeña (899), one of the most influential monastic houses later in Castile together with the Monastery of Santo Domingo de Silos. He was also the founder of the other Monastic House of San Pedro de Arlanza (912).<br />
In 912, he took main part in the Castilian offensive to the river Duero, settling the old villages of Haza, Clunia and San Esteban de Gormaz.<br />
Gonzalo Fernández appears as Count of Castile for the first time in a document of January 8, 914 and again in January 1, 915. He appears witnessing royal documents among other magnates and nobles at the Leonese Court main Assemblies until the defeat of the Leonese in the battle of Valdejunquera (920), after which he was considered dead. Modern scholars suspect that he must have been in disgrace at Court for some unrecorded mistake or other major offense typically resulting in exile, as somebody with his name and the seldom given then rank of Count - Gundisalvus comes - appears signing royal documents at the Court of Navarre between the years 924 and 930, the year that his son was given the authority of Count alone. Previously, his wife Munia Donna (or Muniadona) appears holding the patrimony estates and county regency during the minority of their son Fernan Gonzalez.<br />
His remains were laid to rest in a vault at San Pedro de Arlanza, as Friar Antonio de Yepes registers in his "General Chronicle".<br />
