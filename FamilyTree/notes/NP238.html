 HEINRICH
<p>
<a name ="I007854"><b>[I007854]</b></a><br />
Henry IV (November 11, 1050 - August 7, 1106) was King of Germany from 1056 and Emperor from 1084, until his abdication in 1105. He was the third emperor of the Salian dynasty.<br>
<br>
Henry was the eldest son of the Emperor Henry III, by his second wife Agnes de Poitiers, and was probably born at the royal palace at Goslar. His christening was delayed until the following Easter so that Abbot Hugh of Cluny could be one of his godparents. But even before that, at his Christmas court Henry III induced the attending nobles to promise to be faithful to his son. Three years later, still anxious to insure the succession, Henry III had a larger assembly of nobles elect the young Henry as his successor, and then, on July 17, 1054, had him crowned as king by Archbishop Herman of Cologne. Thus when Henry III unexpectedly died in 1056, the accession of the 6-year-old Henry IV was not opposed. The dowager Empress Agnes acted as regent. Henry's reign was marked by efforts to consolidate Imperial power. In reality, however, it was a careful balancing act between maintaining the loyalty of the nobility and the support of the pope. Henry jeopardized both when, in 1075, his insistence on the right of a secular ruler to invest, i.e., to place in office, members of the clergy, especially bishops, began the conflict known as the Investiture Controversy. In the same year he defeated a rebellion of Saxons in the First Battle of Langensalza. Pope Gregory VII excommunicated Henry on February 22, 1076. Gregory, on his way to a diet at Augsburg, and hearing that Henry was approaching, took refuge in the castle of Canossa (near Reggio Emilia), belonging to Matilda, Countess of Tuscany. Henry's intent, however, was to perform the penance required to lift his excommunication, and ensure his continued rule. He stood for three days, January 25 to January 27, 1077, outside the gate at Canossa, begging the pope to rescind the sentence (though not, as is often stated, in bare shirt with no food or shelter). The Pope lifted the excommunication, imposing a vow to comply with certain conditions, which Henry soon violated.<br>
<br>
In his last years Henry faced rebellions from his eldest son and his wife. He died at Liège in 1106, "like one falling asleep", after nine days of illness. He was interred next to his father at Speyer.<br>
<br>
Marriages<br>
<br>
In 1055 Henry was betrothed to Bertha of Maurienne, daughter of Count Otto of Savoy. They were married in June 1066. In 1068 he attempted to divorce her, but was unable and Bertha was restored as Empress a year later. She died on December 27, 1086 and was buried at the cathedral of Speyer. Their children were:<br>
   1. Agnes of Germany (born 1072/1073), married Frederick I von Staufen, Duke of Swabia.<br>
   2. Conrad (February 12, 1074-July 27, 1101)<br>
   3. Adelaide, died in infancy<br>
   4. Henry, died in infancy<br>
   5. Henry (1086)<br>
<br>
In 1089 Henry married Eupraxia of Kiev, the only daughter of Vsevolod I, Prince of Kiev, and sister to his son Vladimir Monomakh  (1053 -- May 19, 1125), prince of Kievan Rus. She assumed the name "Adelaide" upon her coronation. In 1094 she joined a rebellion against him, accusing Henry of holding her prisoner; of forcing her to participate in orgies; and attempting a black mass on her naked body.<br>

Henry III (October 29, 1017 - October 5, 1056) was a member of the Salian (sometimes Franconian) dynasty of Holy Roman Emperors. He became king of Germany upon the death of his father, the emperor Conrad II on June 4, 1039. He was crowned emperor by Pope Clement II in 1046.<br>
<br>
Henry was married in 1036 to Canute the Great's daughter Gunhilda, born around 1020. Early on Henry's father emperor Conrad II had arranged fief with Canute to have him rule over some parts of northern Germany and in turn to have their children get married. After the marriage took place at the earliest legal age, Gunhilda died just two years later at the Adriatic Coast on an imperial journey.<br>
<br>
Henry was re-married in 1043 to Agnes de Poitiers, daughter of duke of William V of Aquitaine. They had a son Henry IV, Holy Roman Emperor and a daughter, Judith of Swabia.<br>
<br>
In 1046 Henry held royal/imperial courts at Merseburg and Meissen, where he ended the strife between the Dux Bomeraniorum, the duke Bratislaw of Bohemia and Casimir I of Poland. This is one of the earliest, or perhaps the earliest, recording of the name of Pomerania.<br>
<br>
Henry's reign as emperor was marked by his attempts to reform the Church, but also by his use of lay investiture to further his religious and political goals. This policy was continued by his son and successor, Henry IV, and eventually lead to the imperial-papal conflict known as the Investiture Controversy.<br>

Alva Heintz Stone, 84, passed away on Saturday, August 20, 2011.

Frank Joseph HEINTZ
<p>
<a name ="I021898"><b>[I021898]</b></a><br />
Frank J. Heintz tried twice to join each branch of the U.S. Armed Forces during World War II, but epilepsy thwarted him. Seeking to understand and teach the issues that drive nations to war, he earned a doctorate in political science and became a professor at John Carroll University, where he and the Rev. Paul A. Woelfl co-founded the Department of Political Science.<br>
He developed so many courses, including favorites of pre-law students, that he sometimes said he had "taught all of Cleveland's best judges, and many of the bad ones, too."<br>
Heintz died from pneumonia Wednesday at Hillcrest Hospital. It was the day before his 85th birthday, and two months after the death of his wife of 56 years, the former Catherine Bolger.<br>
He met her while earning his doctorate at Catholic University, where he wrote a dissertation on the United Nations that has been cited frequently by Congress. He came to JCU in 1956 after post-doctoral work at Harvard and teaching at Duquesne University.<br>
He cited his devout Catholicism and his father, a lawyer in the Florida Attorney General's Office, for fostering his commitment to using political activism for social justice. He worked for numerous local and national campaigns, and was a member of the charter review commission in Cleveland Heights in the 1970s.<br>
His epilepsy, once so bad he suffered seizures on the street, was controlled by medication. Students saw him as a model of overcoming adversity, and sought his guidance on private as well as professional matters.<br>
He is survived by four sons, three daughters and nine grandchildren.<br>
His funeral will be at 10 a.m. today at St. Joan of Arc Catholic Church, 496 E. Washington St., Chagrin Falls. Stroud-Lawrence is handling arrangements.<br>

Frank Joseph HEINTZ
<p>
<a name ="I021895"><b>[I021895]</b></a><br />
Frank Joseph Heintz was born in Medora, Illinois, October 12, 1886, son of Mr. and Mrs. Victor Heintz, and passed away at Tallahassee Memorial Hospital, Tallahassee, Florida on December 12, 1955, a few hours after he was stricken at his desk in the office of the Attorney General. Immediate survivors are his widow, the former Alva Tupper of Jacksonville, Florida, a son, Frank J. Heintz of Cleveland, Ohio, a daughter, Mrs. John P. Stone, of Jacksonville, Florida, and five grandchildren.<br>
Mr. Heintz attended Quincy College, Quincy, Illinois, receiving from that institution his B.A. degree in 1907. He obtained his legal education at the University of Mississippi, and upon graduation from the institution was admitted to practice law in that state in 1911. He moved to Jacksonville, Florida, in 1914, where he was admitted to the bar in that year. From that time until his removal to Tallahassee, Florida, in 1944, he practiced law in Jacksonville, at one time as a member of the firm of Haley and Heintz.<br>
Mr. Heintz entered the army in World War I and received officer training at Fort Sill. At various other times during his military experience he was stationed at Camp Beauregard, in Louisiana, and Camp Jackson, in South Carolina. He was discharged subsequent to the Armistice in 1918 as a Captain of Artillary.<br>
In May, 1939, Mr. Heintz was appointed Referee in Bankruptcy by the late Judge Louie W. Strum. In the early part of 1944 he terminated the practice of law in Jacksonville and a period of his life characterized by his demonstrated ability as a lawyer and the personal affection of many people whose lives he touched. During that period he was a charter member of Timuquana Country Club, a member of the Seminole Club, Friars, and Florida Yacht Club. <br>
Mr. Heintz served as an Assistant Attorney General of Florida from April 1944 to December 12, 1955. He handled numerous important assignments, but perhaps he will be best remembered for his long service as legal representative, under the Attorney General, of the Board of Control [later the Board of Regents]. During that period he dealt with many problems and programs relating to higher education in a changing and expanding Florida; and he disposed of each task which confronted him, complex or otherwise, with understanding of subject matter and skill as a lawyer. <br>
Mr. Heintz was of the Roman Catholic faith. He was a lawyer's lawyer. Yet such was his studious and kindly disposition, his comprehension of traditions and contemporary legal, social and economic problems, that he dealt with issues with warmth and human understanding in the wholesome light of dictated Christian principles.<br>
