Daughter of an unknown Swedish King.<br>

From Wikipedia<br>
<br>
Olof Trätälja, Olaf Tree Feller (Old Norse: Ólafr trételgja, Swedish: Olof Trätälja, Norwegian: Olav Tretelgja) was the son of the Swedish king Ingjald Ill-ruler of the House of Yngling according to Heimskringla. His mother was Gauthild, a princess of West Götaland, whose maternal grandfather was Olof the Sharp-sighted, the king of Nerike.<br>
<br>
His mother sent him to his foster-father Bove in West Götaland, where he grew up with his foster-brother Saxe who was surnamed Flette.<br>
<br>
When Olof heard of his father's death, he assembled the men who were willing to follow him and went to his kinsmen in Nerike, because after his father's atrocities, the Swedes had grown hostile towards the Ynglings.<br>
<br>
When the Swedes learnt that Olof and his kin had sought refuge in Nerike, they were were attacked and had to head west through deep and mountainous forests (Kilsbergen) to lake Vänern and the estuary of Klarälven (where Karlstad is presently situated). Here, they settled and cleared land. Soon they had created a whole province called Värmland, where they could make good living.<br>
<br>
When the Swedes learnt that Olof was clearing land, they were amused and called him the Tree-feller. Olof married a woman named Solveig who was a daughter of Halfdan Guldtand of Soleyar. Olof and Solveigh had two sons, Ingjald Olofsson and Halfdan Hvitbeinn, who were brought up in Soleyar in the house of his mother's uncle Sölve.<br>
<br>
Because of king Ivar Vidfamne and his harsh rule many Swedes emigrated to Värmland, and they became so numerous that the province could not sustain them. The land was afflicted by famine of which the Swedes accused the king. It was an old tradition in Sweden of holding the king responsible for the wealth of the land (see Domalde). The Swedes accused Olof of neglecting his sacrifices to the gods and believed that this was the cause of the famine.<br>
<br>
The Swedish settlers thus rebelled against Olof, surrounded his house on the shores of lake Vänern and burnt him inside it. Thus he was sacrificed to Odin, like his ancestor Domalde.<br>
<br>
However, Historia Norwegiae says that Olof succeeded his father and ruled as the king of Sweden in peace until his death.<br>
    diu et pacifice functus regno plenus dierum obiit in Swethia<br>
The lines of Ynglingatal appear to say that he was was a Swedish prince (svı́a jöfri), and that he was burnt inside his hall and disappeared from Gamla Uppsala<br>

Anund INGVARSSON
<p>
<a name ="I008120"><b>[I008120]</b></a><br />
From Wikipedia<br>
<br>
Anund, Brøt-Anundr (Old East Norse) or Braut-Önundr (Old West Norse), meaning trail-blazer Anund or Anund the land-clearer, d. ca 640, was a legendary Swedish king of the House of Yngling.<br>
<br>
Anund succeeded his father Ingvar on the Swedish throne, and after his father's wars against Danish vikings and Estonian pirates, peace reigned over Sweden and there were good harvests. Anund was a popular king who became very rich, not only because of the peace and the good harvests but also because he avenged his father in Estonia. That country was ravaged far and wide and in the autumn Anund returned with great riches.<br>
<br>
In those days Sweden was dominated by vast and uninhabited forests, so Anund started making roads and clearing land and vast districts were settled by Swedes. Consequently he was named Bröt-Anund. He made a house (Husby) for himself in every district and used to stay as a guest in many homes.<br>
<br>
One autumn, King Anund was travelling between his halls (see Husbys) and came to a place called Himinheiđr (sky heath) between two mountains. He was surprised by a landslide which killed him.<br>
    We all have heard how Jonkur's sons,<br>
    Whom weapons could not touch, with stones<br>
    Were stoned to death in open day,<br>
    King Onund died in the same way.<br>
    Or else perhaps the wood-grown land,<br>
    Which long had felt his conquering hand,<br>
    Uprose at length in deadly strife,<br>
    And pressed out Onund's hated life.<br>
<br>
The original text of Ynglingatal is hard to interprete, and it only says that Anund died und Himinfjöllum (under the sky mountains) and that stones were implied. According to Historia Norwegiae, he was murded by his brother Sigvard in Himinherthy (which the source says means "the fields of the sky", cœli campus. Such a place name is not known and Birger Nerman suggests that the original place of death was under the sky mountains, i.e. under the clouds (cf. the etymology of cloud). Consequently, he may have been killed outdoors, by his brother and with a stone.<br>
<br>
Thorsteins saga Vı́kingssonar says that Anund was not the son of Ingvar, but the son of his grand-father Östen. It also relates that he had a brother named Olaf who was the king of Fjordane.<br>
<br>
All sources say that Anund was the father of the infamous Ingjald ill-ruler.<br>

Laura Innes as Dr. Kerry Weaver on ER<br>
<br>
Laura Elizabeth Innes (born August 16, 1959) is an American actress and director.<br>
<br>
Innes was born in Pontiac, Michigan and introduced to professional theater by her father, who frequently took the family to the Stratford Shakespeare Festival in Ontario, Canada. Following his advice to "do what you love," she attended Northwestern University and earned a degree in theater.<br>
<br>
Her first stage credits were in Chicago at the renowned Goodman Theater, where among other roles she played Stella opposite John Malkovich's Stanley in A Streetcar Named Desire. Other major stage credits include Two Shakespearean Actors with Eric Stoltz at Lincoln Center, Our Town at the Seattle Repertory Theatre, and Three Sisters at the La Jolla Playhouse in San Diego.<br>
<br>
Innes guest-starred on television series such as Party of Five, My So-Called Life, and Brooklyn Bridge and appeared in the Emmy-winning cable movie And the Band Played On before being cast in her first major TV role as Thomas Haden Church's promiscuous ex-wife Bunny on the NBC comedy series Wings (1991-1993). She caught the attention of the creative team at the network's popular medical drama, ER, who during its second season cast her in the recurring role of Dr. Kerry Weaver, then made her a regular cast member when the series began its third season. Her character has served as a positive role model for both the physically-challenged and the lesbian community. She has received two Emmy Award nominations for her portrayal, as well as three Screen Actors Guild Awards as part of the "ER" ensemble, and has received five nominations for Best Supporting Actress from Viewers for Quality Television.<br>
<br>
Innes has also directed several episodes of the series, as well as episodes of The West Wing, one of which earned her an Emmy nomination for directing.<br>
<br>
In film, Innes has co-starred with Téa Leoni, Morgan Freeman, and Vanessa Redgrave in the blockbuster film Deep Impact and with ER castmate Noah Wyle in Canʼt Stop Dancing.<br>
<br>
She is married to actor David Brisbin and the mother of two children, Cal and Mia.<br>
<br>
------------------------------------------------------------<br>
From Yahoo:<br>
After years on the outskirts of fame, playing insignificant roles in TV-movies and series since 1995, this sharply beautiful, blonde actress found success as the tough, straightforward chief resident Kerry Weaver on the hugely popular NBC series "ER".<br>
<br>
Innes spent much of the 1980s honing her talents onstage, including a four year stint acting with Chicago's Goodman Theater, where she appeared (as Stella) alongside John Malkovich (as Mitch) in a Chicago production of "A Streetcar Named Desire" and in the premiere of David Mamet's "Edmund". Her other stage work has included the Broadway production of "Two Shakespearean Actors", "Our Town" (Seattle, WA) and "Three Sisters" (La Jolla, CA). She also had a supporting role in the pilot "The Stiller and Meara Show" (NBC, 1986) and the TV-movies "Jacob Have I Loved" (PBS, 1989) and "Philby" (ABC, 1989).<br>
<br>
After her marriage and the birth of her son, Innes decided to move to L.A. to pursue a career in TV and films. She guested on such shows as "My So-Called Life" and "Brooklyn Bridge" and from 1991-1993 appeared in several episodes of "Wings" (NBC) as Bunny, the dizzily nymphomaniac ex-wife of eccentric mechanic Lowell Mather (Thomas Haden Church). Innes also had small roles in four 1993 TV-movies, notably "Judith Krantz's 'Torch Song'" (ABC) and the award-winning "And the Band Played On" (HBO), as an hemophiliac.<br>
<br>
In 1995, she simultaneously played two roles: Louie Anderson's wife on the short-lived CBS sitcom "The Louie Show" (which was broadcast early in 1996), and the stern Dr. Weaver on 14 episodes of "ER". In 1996, she had a leading role in the Disney TV-movie "Just Like Dad" and her popularity was rewarded when Dr. Weaver was made a permanent cast member of "ER" as of the 1996-1997 season. The character's hard edges were also softened a bit to make her more palatable for the long haul.<br>

<p>
<a name ="I004606"><b>[I004606]</b></a><br />
From Wikipedia<br>
<br>
Llywelyn ap Iorwerth (c. 1173-April 11, 1240) was a Prince of Gwynedd. Although he is often referred to as a Prince of Wales, his official title was "Prince of Aberffraw and Lord of Snowdon" (the first "official" Prince of Wales was his son, Dafydd). He was also known as Llywelyn the Great or, in Welsh, Llywelyn Fawr.<br>
<br>
Llywelyn was born in 1173, the grandson of Owain Gwynedd. His father Iorwerth having been disposed by Owain's other sons after Owain's death, Llywelyn was left to fend for himself until, as a youth, his natural superiority made itself felt and he defeated his uncles to take Gwynedd for himself. He consolidated this conquest in 1205 by marrying Joan, illegitimate daughter of King John of England. Despite occasional disputes with John and his successor, Henry III, Llywelyn succeeded in maintaining Welsh independence. After a long struggle, he gained the ascendancy over his main rival, Gwenwynwyn of Powys, so as to unite the country.<br>
<br>
His marriage to Joan has an unusual history. Following the birth of a legitimate heir, Dafydd ap Llywelyn, and a daughter, Elen (who was married off to the Norman Earl of Chester), Joan committed adultery with William de Braose or Breos, a Norman noble of south Wales who had allied himself with Llywelyn by the marriage of his daughter, Isabella, to Llywelyn's son, Dafydd. On learning of the affair in 1230, Llywelyn executed de Braose and Joan was imprisoned. Some time later, she was forgiven and restored to her position as princess, dying in 1237.<br>
<br>
Llywelyn died in 1240 and a power struggle arose between his legitimate son, Dafydd, and his older, illegitimate son, Gruffydd, who according to Welsh law had equal rights of inheritance. Llywelyn had departed from tradition by naming Dafydd as his sole heir, as he recognised the Welsh custom of dividing inheritance equally amongst all male sons prevented a cohesive polity from forming, preventing a united Wales. Gruffydd was killed attempting to escape from the Tower of London in 1244, leaving the field clear for Dafydd, but Dafydd himself died without heirs in 1246, and was eventually succeeded by his nephew, Llywelyn the Last.<br>

John M. IRVIN
<p>
<a name ="I062883"><b>[I062883]</b></a><br />
John M. Irvin, son of John and Mary (Johnson) <br>
Irvin, was about eight years old when the family came to live in Charlotte township, upon the farm his father had acquired, and until his years of school study closed he attended the Union No. 6 District School, working at many minor farming tasks meanwhile. After leaving school, he earnestly began work, finding plenty with which to occupy his time on the extensive, and to some extent undeveloped, acreage his father owned. He assisted his father and elder brothers in the operation of the farm until he was twenty years old, and then could not be held back from offering his strong arm to his country, in its national stress of Civil War. On Aug. 28, 1862. John M. Irvin enlisted in Company F, 154th New York Regiment, his immediate commander being Capt. Donneley, and the regimental commander being Col. P. H. Jones. With that unit he served until almost the war's end, when he was transferred to the Second Battalion, Veterans' Relief Corps, under Capt. Myers. Eventually, on June 30, 1865, he was mustered out, with an honorable certificate, at Nashville, Tenn. His military record and war service was meritorious; he was present at the battle of Chancellorsville, 1863, which was disastrous in many ways for both Union and Confederate forces. young Irvin took part in Rockyface Ridge, where he suffered dislocation of the knee, and fracture of three ribs, wounds, which kept him in hospital at Nashville, Tenn., for several weeks; for meritorious service he was promoted to the grade of sergeant, while in Virginia, in 1863. He participated in the battle of Lookout Mountain, and in the decisive battle of Gettysburg, which seemed to be the turning point of the war, in favor of the Union. He served until midsummer of 1865. then was honorably discharged. He returned to his home, and took up the work of farming the homestead tract of 120 acres in Charlotte township, his father having died a year earlier, while he was in the military service. From 1865 until 1889, John M. Irvin held steadily and successfully to farming, and during that tim greatly improved the property, building house, barn, and other buildings, and making the farm a rich one for dairying purposes. During the twenty-four years of his operation of the farm, he proved himself to be a skillful farmer, as well as a good man of business. In i88g he retired from farming, and left the farm management in the hands of his son. Going to Sinclairville, and being of too energetic a nature to retire altogether from business, he established himself as a merchant, handling shingles and other builders' supplies, and also artificial fertilizers. For sixteen years he held to that business, but in 1905 retired altogether from trading, but he still held to his public work. <br>
Mr. Irvin married, in Charlotte township, Nancy, daughter of John and Margaret (Harper) Allen. Their wedded life has been a long and happy one; they are the parents of three children:<br>
  1. Hattie May, who married A. L. Staples, of Jamestown, N. Y., where they now reside.<br>
  2. Arthur C, who lives at Silver Creek, Chautauqua county, N. Y. <br>
  3. Ernest C, who took up financial affairs, and now is cashier of the State Bank at Sinclairville, N. Y. <br>
