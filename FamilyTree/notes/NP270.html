Funeral of Mrs. Hannah Paulsen held on Monday--<br>
Deceased Was a Resident of Howard County for Fifty-Eight Years; a Fine Lady --<br>
Had Reached Fine Age--<br>
The many friends of Mrs. Hanna Paulsen were grieved and shocked to learn of her sudden death on Thursday, February 14th, 1935.<br>
She had not been in very good health for some time, but her condition was not alarming and even that day her doctor saw no reason for alarm. Her heart was strong and pulse normal, but the Supreme Ruler knew what was going on and within a short time He had called her to her well earned rest in heaven.<br>
Hanna Isaacson was born at Boden, Sweden, on November 18, 1857 and when she passed away last Thursday she had reached the age of 77 years, 3 month, and 26 days.<br>
Miss Isaacson and Chris Paulsen were married when she was 24 years of age and to this union were born three sons and three daughters, one son and one daughter preceding her in death. Fifty-eight years ago the Paulsen family moved to Howard county and they have resided here ever since, excepting for a short time when Mrs. Paulsen resided with her daughter, Mrs. V. E. Evans, in Grand Island, following the death of Mr. Paulsen several years ago.<br>
Surviving are her children, Mrs. Max Wilcox, of San Francisco, California; Mrs. Verdon E. Evans, of Grand Island; Glen Paulsen, Palmer, and Ray Paulsen, Lake Andes, So. Dak. In addition there is a brother, who resides near Dannebrog.<br>
Mrs. Paulsen was among the pioneers of Howard county. Fifty-eight years ago when she landed in Howard county it was not very thickly settled, nor was it the best place in the state to live and rear a family. But with true pioneer spirit she tackled the big job of making it a better place in which to reside and bring up a family. Today we have almost every modern convenience in this county, good schools and churches and many miles of improved highways, all of the above coming during the lifetime of Mrs. Paulsen and she had her share in the good work of getting those improvements for this county.<br>
Mrs. Paulsen was a fine lady, a good wife and mother and she leaves four mighty fine children to carry on in her stead. She had a large circle of warm friends in this city and community who were delighted to associate with her. She would go and live for a time with some of her children, but she soon had to return to this city to be in the midst of her many warm friends and associates. A mighty fine lady called to her well earned heavenly home.<br>
The funeral was held on Monday afternoon from the Presbyterian church, Rev. Wm. J. Primrose, pastor having charge of the services and he was ably assisted by Rev. J. Chr. Pedersen of Dannebrog, life-long friend of the Paulsen family, who delivered the funeral sermon which was well worth hearing. Following the conclusion of the services at the church the remains were conveyed to Dannebrog where they were interred in the family plot in beautiful Oak Ridge cemetery. All of the children were here for the funeral, which was largely attended by friends and old neighbors of the family.<br>
The Phonograph wishes to join with the many friends in extending condolence and sympathy to the bereaved children in their sorrow over the loss of their dear one. May she rest in peace.<br>

Ulrick Lindstrom ISAACSON
<p>
<a name ="I046810"><b>[I046810]</b></a><br />
Ulrik and family emigrated on 17 July 1877 from the village of Svartbjorsbyn, parish of Overlulea, Sweden. They left Gothenburg on 3 Aug 1877 for Omaha Nebr. Ulrik is listed on the emigration CD (only heads of household are listed) as Ulric Isacson. The Wikstrom's came with them (Isac Oscar, Gustaf Adolf and Augusta with her family). Most of Ulrik's family lived in Svartbjorsbyn 3, which means farm number 3 in Svartbjorsbyn.<br>
The steamship that took Ulrik's family from Gothenburg to Hull England (the first part of their journey) was called the Rollo. Traveling with Ulrik Isaacson were his daughters (Maria 21, Johanna 18, Ulrika 14 and Evelina 6) and sons (Otto 11 and Edward 10). The journey from Svartbjorsbyn to Gothenburg covered a distance of approximately 1000 miles.<br>
The parish of Nederlulea was becoming too big of a parish, people had too far to travel to go to church, so in 1832, it was split into two parts, Over and Nederlulea (Over- with dots over the O means above). The decision on where to place the new church was difficult, Boden finally got it and that made Boden the main village in Overlulea. If Overlulea is found in the places before 1832, it should be Lulea.<br>
About the Lindstrom name: around 1820, it was very popular to take a nice sounding name, you just went to the priest and he wrote the name down and it became final. It didn't need to have anything to do with your father's name and maybe not all of your children decided to use it, it was up to them.<br>
Concerning last names in Sweden: In early Sweden, often you took your last name after your father's first name, Isacsson simply means the son of Isac (Isacs son). So Ulrik could choose to call himself Isacsson or his father's last name Lindstrom (Lindstrom was quite a common chosen name). Around 1820, a lot of people chose popular names (Lindstrom, Bostrom, etc.) to seperate themselves from other people. However, around 1880, the first mentioned custom to just use your father's first name as your own last name stopped and a lot of families started using this as a family name, Ulrik's father's name was used by some family members and Lindstrom was used by others.<br>
Ulrik was a farmer in Sweden, as were his brothers. It was originally thought that Ulrik's brother (Ludvig) and sister (Fredrika) emigrated together to South Dakota. However, Fredrika and husband (Johan Bostrom) emigrated soon after they were married in the summer of 1878 and settled in Cheyenne, WY. Soon after they moved to Custer Co., South Dakota. Ludvig and family left Sweden in 1878, and went to Howard County, Nebr. He is listed in the 1879 school census (District 31) for Howard Co., Nebr., with children named Wendela (age 12), Anna (age 11) and Isak (age 8). He is also found in the 1880 Federal Census in Howard Co. Ludvig was found in the 1900 census living in Custer Co., SD and in a government land list in 1905 on a piece of land next to his sister (Fredrika) and her husband (Johan Bostrom). A nephew of Ulrik (son of Lars Olof) Isac Otto Lindstrom (b. 1866) went to Golden City, Colorado in 1887.<br>
The 1883 School census for Howard County (NE), number 30, shows Ulrich Isaacson with the following children: Oscar age 6, John 19, Ulrich 16, and Alma, 10.<br>
It appears that Isac Oscar Wikstrom's aunt (Maria) and her husband (Johan Wallgren) started the emigration process for the Lindstroms, Wikstroms, Stroms, Isacssons, Utterstrom, etc., in 1872 when they went to Omaha then to Dannebrog. This did not end until the 1950's when Ingrid Utterstrom and family emigrated to the Portland, Oregon area.<br>
The emigration started later in the northern part of Sweden compared to the rest of the country. The reason for our lines emigrating to the USA is uncertain, the really hard years were from 1867-1868 when people in northern Sweden starved.<br>
Ulrick and Anna were in the 1880 Federal Census in Danebrog, Howard County, Nebr. and in the 1900 Census for Rockville Township, Sherman County, Nebr. living with their son John Otto. He moved from Howard Co. to Sherman County by 1900 as he was listed in a farmers directory (as was his son Edward) for Sherman County in 1900. Their other son, Edward, was found in the same census in the same town. <br>
Ulrick's first wife (Anna C. Nordmark, the mother of his children) died in Skogsan on 26 Oct. 1875. The family made the journey to the United States without a mother, the older sisters: Maria and Johanna probably helped with the younger children. Ulric must have married Anna Maria Ollandt in 1879-80. She appears in the 1880, 1900 and 1910 census with Ulric and she is listed as being from Finland. She emigrated the same year, 1877, as Ulrick and family. The 1910 census shows this is her second marriage and that she had 10 children, with two still living.<br>
When Ulrick first got married they lived with his parents in Svartbjorsbyn, Overlulea, Sweden, until 1862. They then moved to a farm in Boden, Overlulea, Sweden that was owned by his father. Around 1870 he moved to Skogsa (dots over the a means woodriver), Overlulea, Sweden. They lived on the same farm as his sister Hedvig and her husband, Olof Nordmark. This farm was owned by his younger brother, Ludvig. Ludvig owned another farm in Skogsa where he and his family lived.<br>

Bernard of ITALY
<p>
<a name ="I004759"><b>[I004759]</b></a><br />
Bernard was the illegitimate son of King Pepin of Italy, the second legitimate son of the Emperor Charlemagne. In 810, Pepin died from an illness contracted at a siege of Venice; although Bernard was illegitimate, Charlemagne allowed him to inherit Italy. Bernard married a woman named Cunigunde, but the year of their marriage, and her origins are obscure; spuriously she has been called "of Laon". They had one son, Pepin, Count of Vermandois.<br>
-------------------------------------------<br>
Bernard of Italy was the King of Italy (810 - 818). He was the illegitimate son of King Pepin, the third son of the Emperor Charlemagne. In 817, he rebelled against his uncle, the Holy Roman Emperor Louis the Pious, but was defeated the following year. Louis crowned his eldest son, Lothar (later Holy Roman Emperor) as King of Italy, and had Bernard blinded and imprisoned. His death in 818 grieved Louis, and his display of penance to the court in 822 reduced his prestige and respect amongst the Frankish nobility.<br>

From Wikipedia<br>
<br>
Pippin of Italy (April, 773 - July 8, 810) was the third son of Charlemagne, and the second with his wife Hildegard of Savoy. He was born Carloman, but when his brother Pippin the Hunchback betrayed their father, the royal name Pippin passed to him. He was made king of Italy at after his father's conquest of the Lombards in 781. He was crowned King by Pope Hadrian I.<br>
<br>
He was active as ruler of Italy and worked to expand the Frankish empire. This included a long, but unsuccessful siege of Venice in 810. The siege lasted six months and Pippin's army was ravaged by the diseases of the local swamps and was forced to withdraw. A few months later Pippin died.<br>
<br>
He married Bertha of Toulouse and had five daughters with her: Adelheid, Atala, Gundrada, Berthais, and Tetrada. He also had an illegitimate son Bernard. Pippin was expected to inherit a third of his father's empire, but Pippin died before him. The Italian crown passed on to his son Bernard, but the empire went to Pippin's younger brother Louis the Pious.<br>
