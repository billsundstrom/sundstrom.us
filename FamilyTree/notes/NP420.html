Emma Jane PEARL
<p>
<a name ="I092635"><b>[I092635]</b></a><br />
Emma and her husband had eight children in Nova Scotia.  Emma left her husband and children, going with Caleb Arnold and taking the youngest child with her, first to Massachusetts, then to Maine, USA, and began a new life with more children.  Emma lost her second family as well.  She seemed to be living with just her three children in Portland when they were taken into care in 1915, Grace had died previously, and baby Harold was adopted soon after birth.  She lost touch with her children though it seems that she might still have had some contact with one or more of her sisters.  Elida Pearl Hustin was living in Maine where Ella Pearl Sanford and her daughter Evelyn Sanford joined her.  Their sister Susan (surname unknown) was also living somewhere in the US during this time.  Pat Dutile (Emma's great  grand daughter recalled her grandmother, Love, saying she remembered one of Emma's sisters from Nova Scotia came to get her, and she remembered her mother leaving with a suitcase.  Emma entered the Maine State Mental Hospital in Augusta some time after 1920, and when she got well, opted to remain there doing the sewing.  She was on the census for Portland, Maine in 1920 but in the State Hospital in 1930.  Emma was a fine seamstress.  Her daughter Charlotte remembered her making their clothes and sewing coats for other people.<br>

Nathan Michael PEARSON
<p>
<a name ="I109305"><b>[I109305]</b></a><br />
Nathan Michael Pearson, 32, was born June 1, 1984 in Fort Wayne, Indiana. The second son of William and Elaine Pearson (nee Cady), Nathan was always a happy lively child who loved family, bikes, school, and baseball. When he was 11, he moved to Sycamore, Illinois with his family where he thrived at church, school, basketball, and boy scouts and was loved by all around him. He graduated from Sycamore High School where he was active in sports, choir, and theater.<br>
After high school Nathan went on a two year mission for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints to Birmingham, Alabama, where he learned to love the southern culture and people. After his mission he attended BYU-Idaho and then moved to Utah where he graduated from Utah Valley University with a bachelor in marketing and then recently with an MBA.<br>
Nathan loved to mountain bike and was beloved by all bikers. While on a bike he would fly through the mountains taking in the great beauty of the earth. He was truly at home in the mountains. He constantly tried to build the perfect mountain bike, over the last nine years he bought and custom built over 25 mountain bikes. His love for biking grew into owning a bike shop in Orem, Utah named Urban Downfall. Nathan touched many lives in the biking community through his kindness and generosity. He often spent many long nights helping people troubleshoot their bike issues and life problems.<br>
For the past few years Nathan was afflicted with night seizures, which we believe ultimately took his life early in the morning of Sunday, June 26, 2016.<br>
Nathan lived his life to the fullest and his enthusiasm for life was always infectious. He loved those around him more than most do in a lifetime. He loved his family more than anything and always made time for them to do all sorts of fun things even to the point of crashing his parentsʼ vacations in order to spend time more quality time with them.<br>
We are deeply saddened and will miss Nathan more than we can adequately express. We firmly believe in the eternal nature of families and know that he will one day be raised in the resurrection as a glorified and celestial being. We will see Nathan again.<br>
Nathan is survived by his parents, William and Elaine Pearson (Cedar Rapids, Iowa); his brothers, Neal (Becky), Craig (Kelsey), Justin and his sister Britta. He also leaves behind his three nieces, Genevieve, Ruby and Zoey; and his nephew William. He also leaves behind his grandparents, Mark and Lee Cady, Plymouth, Michigan and Gloria Pearson, Sycamore, Illinois. He was preceded in death by his Grandpa, Warren Pearson of Sycamore. He will be greatly missed by his family and friends, with which he loved so dearly.<br>
There will be a viewing Friday, July 1, 2016 from 6-8 p.m. at Butala Funeral Home, 1405 DeKalb Ave. Sycamore, Illinois and an additional viewing Saturday morning July 2 from 9 -10 a.m. at the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, 675 Fox Avenue, Sycamore, Illinois. The funeral service will follow at 10:30 AM. The gravesite dedication and burial will immediately follow at Elmwood Cemetery, Sycamore, Illinois.<br>
There is an additional memorial services at the LDS church building, 4032 South 2300 East, Holladay, Utah 84124, Sunday July 3, 2016 at 7 p.m. with future services in Cedar Rapids, Iowa and a mountain trail memorial in Utah, organized by the biking community.<br>
He touched many lives and we are quickly finding that he helped hundreds of people along the way. Nathan lived a life of selfless and humble service. Nathan will be missed.<br>
