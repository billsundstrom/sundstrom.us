<h2>Notes</h2>
Gilbert DE CHALON
<p>
<a name ="I005246"><b>[I005246]</b></a><br />
Gilbert of Chalon or Giselbert (died April 8, 956) was duke of Burgundy between 952 and 956. He ruled Burgundy in the name of his wife, Ermengarde, sister of Hugh the Black, with whom he had two daughters: Adelais and Liutgarde. Gilbert never managed to maintain the independence of the duchy in the struggles for power of 10th century France. In 955, he became a vassal of Hugh Capet, count of Paris and was compelled to give his oldest daughter to Hugh's son Odo of Paris.<br>
</p>
Adele DE CHAMPAGNE
<p>
<a name ="I007529"><b>[I007529]</b></a><br />
Adèle de Champagne (c. 1140 - June 4, 1206) was the daughter of Theobald IV of Blois and Matilda of Carinthia.<br>
<br>
She was the third wife of Louis VII of France, with whom she had two children:<br>
    * Dieudonné, the future Philippe Auguste (born August 21, 1165), the only male heir of Louis VII<br>
    * Agnes of France c. 1171 - after 1240)<br>
<br>
She was active in the political life of the kingdom, along with her brothers Henry I of Champagne, Theobald V of Blois, and William, archbishop of Reims. Henry and Theobald were married to daughters of Louis VII and his first wife Eleanor of Aquitaine. She and her brothers felt their position threatened when the heiress of Artois, Isabelle of Hainaut, married Adèle's son, Philippe. Adèle formed an alliance with Hugh III, Duke of Burgundy and Count Philip of Flanders, and even tried to interest Frederick Barbarossa. War broke out in 1181, and relations became so bad that Philippe attempted to divorce Isabelle in 1184.<br>
<br>
Although her power decreased after the accession of Philippe in 1180, she acted as regent of the kingdom in 1190 while Philip was away on the Third Crusade. She returned to the shadows when he returned in 1192 but participated in the founding of many abbeys.<br>
<br>
She died on June 4, 1206, and was buried in the church of Pontigny near Auxerre.<br>

Henri I DE CHAMPAGNE
<p>
<a name ="I008344"><b>[I008344]</b></a><br />
Henry I of Champagne (died March 17, 1181), known as "the Liberal", was count of Champagne from 1152 to 1181.<br>
<br>
He was the eldest son of Count Thibaut II of Champagne (who was also Count Thibaut IV of Blois). On his father's death, Henry chose to take Champagne, leaving the family's older holdings (including Blois, Chartres, Sancerre, and Chateaudun) to his younger brothers. At the time this may have been surprising, for the other territories were richer and better developed. Henry must have had forseen the economic possibilities of Champagne, and it is during his rule that the county achieved its high place as one of the richest and strongest of the French principalities.<br>
<br>
Henry established orderly rule over the nobles of Champagne, and could fairly reliably count on the aid of some 2,000 vassals, which just by itself made him a power few in France could equal. This order in turn made Champagne a safe place for merchants to gather, and under the count's protection the Champagne Fairs became a central part of long-distance trade and finance in medieval Europe.<br>
<br>
In addition, the count's court in Troyes became a renowned literary center.<br>
<br>
Henry married Marie of Champagne, daughter of Louis VII of France and Eleanor of Aquitaine. He was succeeded by their eldest son Henry II of Champagne. After Henry II became king of Jerusalem, the younger son Thibaut III became count.<br>

Theobald II DE CHAMPAGNE
<p>
<a name ="I006604"><b>[I006604]</b></a><br />
From Wikipedia<br>
<br>
Theobald II of Champagne (1090-1152) was Count of Champagne from 1125 to 1152. He held Auxerre, Maligny, Ervy, Troyes, and Chateau-Villain as fiefs from Eudes II, Duke of Burgundy. He was the son of Stephen, Count of Blois and Adela of Normandy, and the elder brother of King Stephen of England. Although he was the second son, Theobald was chosen as heir over his elder brother, Guillaume, who was weak mentally.<br>
<br>
In 1123 he married Matilda of Carinthia, daughter of Engelbert II of Carinthia. Their children were:<br>
   1. Henry I of Champagne<br>
   2. Theobald V of Blois<br>
   3. Adèle of Champagne, married King Louis VII of France<br>
   4. Isabelle of Champagne, married William Gouet IV<br>
   5. Marie of Champagne, married Eudes II, Duke of Burgundy, became Abbess of Fontevrault later in life.<br>
<br>
King Louis VII of France became involved in a war with Theobald by permitting Count Raoul I of Vermandois and seneschal of France, to repudiate his wife, Theobald's niece, and to marry Petronilla of Aquitaine, sister of the queen of France. The war, which lasted two years (1142-1144), was marked by the occupation of Champagne by the royal army and the capture of Vitry, where many persons perished in the burning of the church.<br>
<br>
Pierre Abélard sought asylum in Champagne during Theobald II's reign.<br>
<br>
Theobald II was also Theobald IV, Count of Blois.<br>
</p>
Theobald III DE CHAMPAGNE
<p>
<a name ="I008342"><b>[I008342]</b></a><br />
Theobald III of Champagne (d. 1201) was Count of Champagne from 1197 to 1201.<br>
<br>
Theobald was the younger son of Henry I of Champagne and Marie, a daughter of Louis VII of France. He succeeded as Count of Champagne in 1197 upon the death of his older brother Henry II.<br>
<br>
In 1198, Pope Innocent III called the Fourth Crusade. There was little enthusiasm for the crusade at first, but in 1199 various nobles of France gathered at Theobald's court for a tournament, including the preacher Fulk of Neuilly. There, they "took the cross," and elected Theobald their leader, but he died the next year and was replaced by Boniface of Montferrat.<br>
<br>
Theobald married Blanche of Navarre, and was succeeded by his posthumous son by Blanche, Theobald IV. She was to rule as regent for the following 21 years, during which the succession was contested by Theobald's nieces, Alice and Philippa of Champagne.<br>
</p>
Theobald IV DE CHAMPAGNE
<p>
<a name ="I008338"><b>[I008338]</b></a><br />
From Wikipedia<br>
<br>
King Theobald I of Navarre, also Theobald IV of Champagne (1201-1253), known as "the Troubadour," "the Chansonnier," and "the Posthumous," was Count of Champagne and the King of Navarre from 1235. He was the son of Theobald III of Champagne and Blanca of Navarre who herself was the youngest daughter of king Sancho VI of Navarre. His father died before he was born, and Theobald's mother ruled the county as regent until Theobald turned 21 in 1222.<br>
<br>
The first half of Theobald's life was plagued by a number of difficulties. His uncle, Count Henry II, had left behind a great deal of debt, which was far from paid off when Theobald's father died. Further, Theobald's legitimacy was not unquestioned, and his right to the succession was challenged by Henry's daughter Philippa and her husband, Erard I of Brienne, Count of Ramerupt and one of the more powerful nobles of Champagne.<br>
<br>
The conflict with Erard and Philippa broke into open warfare in 1215, and was not resolved until after Theobald came of age in 1222. At that time he bought out their rights for a substantial monetary payment. Some years later, in 1234, he had to spend still more to buy off Philippa's elder sister Alice, Queen of Cyprus. The 1222 settlement did not end Theobald's problems, for in the following years he antagonized Louis VIII.<br>
<br>
At the death of Louis VIII, his political situation was difficult: he had abandoned the king in his campaigns, there were rumors that he had poisoned him, and he was barred from the coronation of Louis IX. At the beginning of the regency of Blanche of Castile, he abandoned a conspiracy against the French king, which also included Hugues de Lusignan and Pierre Mauclerc, and cemented a strong relation with the regent. Many have hinted at a possible love for Blanche, and he wrote a poetical homage to her. He became so influential at court, that other barons resented him and started a rebellion in 1229.<br>
<br>
In the following years, however, he antagonized the young king of France Louis IX, which lead to an invasion of Champagne by a group of French barons. They were driven off at the cost of further expense and hardship in Champagne. Thus in order to settle with Alice, Theobald had to sell his overlordship over the counties of Blois, Sancerre, and Chateaudun to the king.<br>
<br>
He experienced a reversal of his fortunes in 1234, when he succeeded his uncle Sancho VII of Navarre as King of Navarre. This greatly increased his resources (not to mention his prestige), and the remaining years of his rule were far more peaceful and prosperous.<br>
<br>
Theobald married three times. He married Gertrude of Dagsburg in 1220, and divorced her two years later when he came of age. Later in 1222 he married Agnes of Beaujeu. After she died in 1231, he married Margaret of Bourbon (1232).<br>
<br>
He was succeeded first by his elder son Theobald II of Navarre and then by his younger son Henry I of Navarre, both children of his third marriage.<br>

Graucher DE CHATEAURENAUD
<p>
<a name ="I015494"><b>[I015494]</b></a><br />
Fulk of Nevers, known as Oison, Count de Vendôme (1028-1032 and 1056-1066), son of Bodon of Nevers and Adele of Vendôme-Anjou.<br>
<br>
In 1028 with the death of her older brother, Bouchard II of Vendôme, Adèle of Vendôme-Anjou took again the county in entrusted half of it to Fulk Oison. Dissatisfied to have only half, he was unhappy wtih his mother who had gaven her share to Geoffroy II Martel. He quickly set about seizing the entire county. In 1056 at the request of King Henry I of France, Geoffrey Martel returned to him the county of Vendôme under his fealty.<br>
<br>
Regularly in conflict with Thibauld III, Count of Blois, and with the abbey of the Trinity, he died in 1066. He married Pétronille, daughter of Renaud - Lord of Castle-Gontier, and had:<br>
    * Bouchard III the younger<br>
    * Euphrosine, married to Geoffrey III of Preuilly<br>
    * Agathe, married to Raoul Payen Viscount of Vendôme<br>

Raynald DE CHATILLON
<p>
<a name ="I015167"><b>[I015167]</b></a><br />
From Wikipedia<br>
<br>
Raynald of Châtillon (also Reynald or Reginald of Chastillon) (c.1125-July 4, 1187) was a knight who served in the Second Crusade and remained in the Holy Land after its defeat. There he ruled as Prince of Antioch from 1153 to 1160.<br>
<br>
He was a younger son of Henry, lord of Châtillon, from the middle-ranking noble family of Champagne that had produced Eudes of Châtillon, Pope Urban II. Raynald had joined the Second Crusade in 1147 to seek his fortune. He entered the service of Constance of Antioch, whose first husband had died in 1149. She married Raynald in secret in 1153, without consulting her liege lord, Baldwin III of Jerusalem. Neither King Baldwin nor Aimery of Limoges, the Latin Patriarch of Antioch, approved of Constance's choice of a husband of such lower birth.<br>
<br>
One of Raynald's first acts in Antioch was an assault on the Latin Patriarch; he had the Patriarch seized, stripped naked, covered in honey, and left to suffer in the burning sun. When the Patriarch was released, he collapsed in exhaustion and agreed to finance Raynald's expedition against Cyprus. Raynald's forces attacked Cyprus, ravaging the island, and raping and pillaging the inhabitants. Cyprus was a possession of the Byzantine Empire, and in 1159 Raynald was forced to pay homage to Byzantine emperor Manuel I Comnenus as punishment for his attack, promising to accept a Greek Patriarch in Antioch. When Manuel came to Antioch later that year to meet with Baldwin III, King of Jerusalem, Raynald was forced to lead Manuel's horse into the city.<br>
<br>
Soon after this, in 1160, Raynald was captured by the Muslims during a plundering raid against the Syrian and Armenian peasants of the neighbourhood of Marash. He was confined at Aleppo for the next seventeen years. He was ransomed for the extraordinary sum of 120,000 gold dinars in 1176, emerging from his long captivity more bloodthirsty and ambitious than ever. Because his wife Constance had died in 1163, Raynald married another wealthy widow, Stephanie, the widow of both Humphrey III of Toron and Miles of Plancy, and the heiress of the lordship of Oultrejordain, including the castles Kerak and Montreal to the southeast of the Dead Sea. These fortresses controlled the trade routes between Egypt and Damascus and gave Raynald access to the Red Sea. He became notorious for his wanton cruelty at Kerak, often having his enemies and hostages flung from the walls of castle to be dashed to pieces on the rocks below.<br>
<br>
In November 1177, at the head of the army of the kingdom, he defeated Saladin at the Battle of Montgisard; Saladin narrowly escaped. In 1181 the temptation of the caravans which passed by Kerak proved too strong, and, in spite of a truce between Saladin and Baldwin IV, Raynald began to plunder. Saladin demanded reparations from Baldwin IV, but Baldwin could only reply that he was unable to coerce his unruly vassal. The result was a new outbreak of war between Saladin and the Latin kingdom in 1182. In the course of the hostilities Raynald launched ships on the Red Sea, partly for piracy, but partly as a threat against Mecca and Medina, challenging Islam in its own holy places. His pirates ravaged villages up and down the Red Sea, before being captured by the army of Al-Adil I only a few miles from Medina. Although Raynald's pirates were taken to Cairo and beheaded, Raynald himself escaped to the Moab. Saladin vowed to behead Raynald himself, and at the end of the year Saladin attacked Kerak, during the marriage of Raynald's stepson Humphrey IV of Toron to Isabella of Jerusalem. The siege was raised by Count Raymond III of Tripoli, and Reynald was quiet until 1186.<br>
<br>
That year he allied with Sibylla and Guy of Lusignan against Count Raymond, and his influence contributed to the recognition of Guy as king of Jerusalem, although Raymond was the better candidate. Later in 1186 Raynald attacked a caravan in which Saladin's sister was travelling, breaking the truce between Saladin and the Crusaders. King Guy chastised Raynald in an attempt to appease Saladin, but Raynald replied that he was lord of his own lands and that he had made no peace with Saladin. Saladin swore that Raynald would be executed if he was ever taken prisoner.<br>
<br>
In 1187 Saladin invaded the kingdom, defeating the Crusaders at the Battle of Hattin. The battle left Saladin with many prisoners. Most prominent among these prisoners were Reynald and King Guy, both of whom Saladin ordered brought to his tent. According to al-Safadi in al-Wafi bi'l-wafayat, Saladin offered water to Guy, who then gave the glass to Raynald. Saladin knocked the water away, saying that he had not offered water to Raynald and thus was not bound by the Muslim rules of hospitality. After being rebuked by Saladin for his treachery, Raynald was executed, either beheaded by Saladin himself or killed by one of Saladin's men in the presence of his companions. King Guy, however, was spared. Saladin explained that one king did not kill another and that Raynald had only been executed because of his great crimes. Guy was taken to Damascus for a time, then allowed to go free.<br>
<br>
Many of the Crusaders considered Raynald a martyr, although all evidence shows him to have been a plunderer and a pirate who had little concern for the welfare of the Kingdom. The successes of the Kingdom were almost singlehandedly undone by Raynald's recklessness and selfishness.<br>
<br>
Raynald and Constance had two daughters: Agnes, who married king Bela III of Hungary; and Alix, who married Azzo V d'Este.<br>

Eleanor DE CLARE
<p>
<a name ="I005289"><b>[I005289]</b></a><br />
From Wikipedia<br>
<br>
Eleanor de Clare (1292 - June 30, 1337) was the eldest daughter of Gilbert de Clare, 7th Earl of Hertford and 3rd Earl of Gloucester, and Joan of Acre. With her sisters, Elizabeth de Clare and Margaret de Clare, she inherited her father's estates after the death of her brother, Gilbert de Clare, 4th Earl of Gloucester.<br>
<br>
She was born at Caerphilly, Glamorgan, and married, at Westminister, shortly after 14 June 1306, Hugh the younger Despenser, of Hanley Castle, the son of Hugh le Despenser, Earl of Winchester by Isabel Beauchamp, daughter of William de Beauchamp, 9th Earl of Warwick. Her grandfather, King Edward I of England, granted Eleanor a maritagium of 2,000 pounds sterling. Eleanor and Hugh would have ten children:<br>
   1. Hugh le Despenser III (1308-1349)<br>
   2. Gilbert le Despenser, died 1381.<br>
   3. Edward le Despenser, died 1342.<br>
   4. John le Despenser, died June 1366.<br>
   5. Isabel le Despenser (1312-1356), married Richard Fitzalan, 10th Earl of Arundel<br>
   6. Eleanor le Despenser, died after 1351, nun at Semplingham Priory<br>
   7. Joan le Despenser, died 1384, nun at Shaftesbury Abbey<br>
   8. Margaret le Despenser, died 1337, nun at Whatton Priory<br>
   9. Elizabeth le Despenser, born 1325, married Maurice de Berkeley, 4th Baron Berkeley.<br>
<br>
Eleanor's husband rose to prominence as the new favorite of King Edward II of England, who was also Eleanor's uncle. The king strongly favored Hugh and Eleanor, visiting them often and granting them many gifts. One foreign chronicler even alleged that Edward was involved in a ménage à trois with his niece and her husband. Whatever the truth, Eleanor's fortunes changed drastically after the invasion of Queen Isabella and Roger Mortimer. Hugh le Despenser was executed, and she was imprisoned in 1326. She was confined to the Tower of London and Devizes Castle until she signed away her share of the lucrative Clare inheritance to Queen Isabella's paramour, Roger Mortimer. She was accused of stealing back many of Despenser's confiscated items from the Tower of London. Finally in 1328 Eleanor was allowed possession of her own lands, for which she did homage.<br>
<br>
The Despenser family's fortunes were ruined with the executions of Eleanor's husband and father-in-law. Her sons lost their inheritance, and three of her daughters were forcibly veiled as nuns. Only the eldest daughter, Isabel, and the youngest daughter, Elizabeth, escaped the nunnery, Isabel because she was already married and Elizabeth on account of her infancy.<br>
<br>
Eleanor was abducted from Hanley Castle in January 1329 by William de la Zouche. This earned them the ire of Sir John Grey, 1st Baron Grey who was contracted to marry Eleanor. Lord Grey was still attempting to claim Eleanor in 1333. In addition, Eleanor was imprisoned again and fined for marrying without royal permission. Her lands were restored soon thereafter and she was reunited with her new husband, but they never did pay the fine. Eleanor and William had one child:<br>
   1. William de la Zouche, born 1330, died after 1360, a monk at Glastonbury Abbey.<br>
<br>
Eleanor died at Tewkesbury, Gloucestershire, England.<br>

Elizabeth DE CLARE
<p>
<a name ="I008810"><b>[I008810]</b></a><br />
From Wikipedia<br>
<br>
Elizabeth de Clare (September 16, 1295-1360) was the heiress to the lordships of Clare, Suffolk in England and Usk in Wales. She was one of three daughters of Gilbert de Clare, 7th Earl of Hertford and Joan of Acre, and sister of the infant fourth earl, also Gilbert de Clare. She accompanied her brother Gilbert to Ireland for their double wedding to two siblings -- the son and daughter of the Earl of Ulster. Elizabeth married John de Burgh on September 30, 1308.<br>
<br>
He was the heir to the Earl of Ulster, and Elizabeth could expect to be a countess. She gave birth to their only child, a son, in 1312; he would become William Donn de Burgh, 3rd Earl of Ulster. Only a year later, her husband John was suddenly killed in a minor skirmish. Now a widow, Elizabeth remained in Ireland until another family tragedy demanded her return.<br>
<br>
Her brother Gilbert was killed at the Battle of Bannockburn, and as he left no surviving issue and had no brothers, his property was equally divided between his sisters, Elizabeth, Eleanor and Margaret. Suddenly Elizabeth was one of the greatest heiresses in England. Her uncle, King Edward II of England, recalled her to the land of her birth so he could select a husband for her. She left Ireland in 1316, leaving behind her son William. Elizabeth never returned.<br>
<br>
Edward II placed her in Bristol Castle, but his plans to marry her to one of his supporters were dashed in February 1316, when Elizabeth was abducted from Bristol by Theobald II de Verdun, the former Justiciar of Ireland. He and Elizabeth had been engaged before she was called back to England. She was Lady Verdun for only five months however, for Theobald died in September 1316 of typhoid. He left behind three daughters from a prior marriage and Elizabeth, who was pregnant. She fled to Amesbury Priory, where she stayed under the protection of her aunt Mary, who was a nun there. There she gave birth to her daughter, Isabella de Verdun, named for the queen, in February 1317. Just a few weeks later, Edward II married Elizabeth to Sir Roger D'Amory.<br>
<br>
D'Amory had been a knight in her brother's service who rose to prominence as a favorite of Edward II. Now married to him, Elizabeth was caught up in the political upheavals of her uncle's reign. She gave birth to another daughter, Elizabeth D'Amorie, in May 1318. Roger was reckless and violent, and made a deadly enemy of his brother-in-law, Hugh the younger Despenser. He switched sides over to Thomas, Earl of Lancaster, and died in March 1322, having been captured by royalist forces. He left Elizabeth defenseless, and she was captured and imprisoned at Barking Abbey with her children.<br>
<br>
Elizabeth supported her friend, Queen Isabella, when she invaded England and she benefited greatly from the reign of Isabella's son, King Edward III of England. She took a vow of chastity after Roger's death, effectively removing herself from the aristocratic marriage market. She enjoyed a long and fruitful widowhood, becoming patroness of many religious houses. Elizabeth is best remembered for having used much of her fortune to found Clare College, Cambridge.<br>

From Wikipedia<br>
<br>
Gilbert de Clare, 7th Earl of Hertford and 3rd Earl of Gloucester was born 2 September 1243, at Christchurch, Hampshire. He was a powerful Norman noble. Also known as "Red" Gilbert de Clare, probably because of his hair colour, he built Caerphilly Castle.<br>
<br>
Gilbert de Clare was the son of Richard de Clare, Earl of Gloucester and Hertford, and Maud de Lacy, Countess of Lincoln, daughter of John de Lacy and Margaret de Quincy. Gilbert inherited his father's estates he inherited in 1262. He took on the titles, including Lord of Glamorgan, from 1263.<br>
<br>
Being under age at his father's death, he was a ward of Humphrey de Bohun, 2nd Earl of Hereford. In April 1264, he led the massacre of the Jews at Canterbury, as Simon de Montfort had done in London. Gilbert de Clareʼs castles of Kingston and Tonbridge were taken by the King. However, the king allowed his Countess, who was in the latter, to go free because she was his niece; and on 12 May he and Montfort were denounced as traitors. Two days later, just before the battle of Lewes, on 14 May, Montfort knighted the Earl and his brother Thomas. The Earl commanded the second line of the battle and took the King prisoner, having hamstrung his horse. As Prince Edward had also been captured, Montfort and the Earl were now supreme. On 20 October 1264, the Gilbert and his associates were excommunicated by the Papal Legate, and his lands placed under an interdict.<br>
<br>
In the following month, by which time they had obtained possession of Gloucester and Bristol, the Prince and the Earl were proclaimed to be rebels. They at once entered on an active campaign, the Earl, in order to prevent Montfort's escape, destroying ships at Bristol and the Bridge over the Severn. He shared the Prince's victory at Kenilworth on 16 July, and in the battle of Evesham, 4 August, in which Montfort was slain. He commanded the second division and contributed largely to the victory. The castle of Abergavenny was committed to his charge on 25 October and on the 29th the honor of Brecknock was added.<br>
<br>
On 24 June 1268 he took the Cross at Northampton At Michaelmas his disputes with Llewelyn were submitted to arbitration, but without a final settlement. At the end of the year 1268 he refused to obey the King's summons to attend parliament, alleging that, owing to the constant inroads of Llewelyn, his Welsh estates needed his presence for their defense. At the death of Henry III, 16 November 1272, the Earl took the lead in swearing fealty to Edward I, who was then in Sicily on his return from the Crusade. The next day, with the Archbishop of York, he entered London and proclaimed peace to all, Christians and Jews, and for the first time, secured the acknowledgment of the right of the King's eldest son to succeed to the throne immediately. Thereafter he was joint Guardian of England, during the King's absence, and on his arrival in England, in August 1274, entertained him at Tonbridge Castle.<br>
<br>
His first marriage was to Alice de Lusignan, the daughter of Hugh XI of Lusignan. They were married in 1253, when Gilbert was ten-years-old. She was of high birth, being a niece of King Henry, but the marriage floundered. They produced two daughters before separating in 1267; allegedly, Alice's affections lay with her cousin, Prince Edward. Previous to this, Gilbert and Alice had produced two daughters:<br>
   1. Isabel de Clare (10 March 1262-1333), married (1) Guy de Beauchamp, 10th Earl of Warwick; (2) Maurice de Berkeley, 2nd Baron Berkeley<br>
   2. Joan de Clare (1264-after 1302), married (1) Duncan Macduff, 7th Earl of Fife; (2) Gervase Avenel<br>
<br>
After his marriage to Alice de Lusignan was finally anulled in 1285, he married Joan of Acre, a daughter of King Edward I of England and his first wife, Eleanor of Castile. By the provisions of the marriage contract, their joint possessions could only be inherited by a direct descendant. On 3 July 1290 the Earl gave a great banquet at Clerkenwell to celebrate his marriage of 30 April 1290 with the Joan of Acre (1272 - 23 April 1307). Thereafter he and she are said to have taken the Cross and set out for the Holy Land, but in September he signed the Barons' letter to the Pope, and on 2 November surrendered to the King his claim to the advowson of the bishopric of Llandaff. In the next year, 1291, his quarrels with the Earl of Hereford about Brecknock culminated in a private war between them. Both were imprisoned by the King, and the Earl of Gloucester, as the aggressor, was fined 10,000 marks, and the Earl of Hereford 1,000 marks. He died at Monmouth Castle on 7 December 1295, and was buried at Tewkesbury, on the left side of his grandfather Gilbert de Clare.<br>

<br>
He was the son of Richard de Clare, 4th Earl of Hertford, from whom he inherited the Clare estates, from his mother, Amice Fitz Robert, the estates of Gloucester and the honour of St. Hilary, and from Rohese, an ancestor, the moiety of the Giffard estates. In June 1202, he was entrusted with the lands of Harfleur and Montrevillers.<br>
In 1215 Gilbert and his father were two of the barons made Magna Carta sureties and championed Louis "le Dauphin" of France in the First Barons' War, fighting at Lincoln under the baronial banner. He was taken prisoner in 1217 by William Marshal, whose daughter Isabella he later married. In 1223 he accompanied his brother-in-law, Earl Marshal in an expedition into Wales. In 1225 he was present at the confirmation of the Great Charter by Henry III. In 1228 he led an army against the Welsh, capturing Morgan Gam, who was released the next year. He then joined in an expedition to Brittany, but died on his way back to Penrose in that duchy. His body was conveyed home by way of Plymouth and Cranbourgh to Tewkesbury. His widow Isabel later married Richard Plantagenet, Earl of Cornwall & King of the Romans.<br>

From Wikipedia<br>
<br>
Son of Gilbert Fitz Richard Earl of Clare and Alice de Claremont. Sometimes refered to as "Strongbow" but his son is better remembered by this name. Became a great baron, obtaining the estates of his paternal uncles, Roger and Walter, which included the baronies and castles of Bienfaite and Orbec in Normandy, the lordship of Nether Gwent and the castle of Striguil (later Chepstow). King Stephen created him Earl of Pembroke, and gave him the rape and castle of Pevensey. At Stephen's defeat at Lincoln 2 Feb 1140, he was among those who rallied to Empress Matilda when she recovered London in June, but was at Canterbury when Stephen was recrowned late in 1141. He then joined Geoffrey's plot against Stephen, but when that conspiracy collapsed, he was again adhered to Stephen, being with him at the siege of Oxford late in 1142. In 1147 he rebelled when Stephen refused to give him the castles surrendered by his nephew Gilbert, 2nd Earl of Hertford, whereupon the King marched to his nearest castle and nearly captured him. However, the Earl appears to have made his peace with Stephen before his death the following year. He married Isabel de Beaumont (1112-1172), around 1130, daughter of Sir Robert de Beaumont, Earl of Leicester, Count of Meulan, and Isabel de Vermandois. Isabel had previously been the mistress of King Henry I of England.<br>

Margaret de Clare<br>
From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia.<br>
<br>
Margaret de Clare (1293-April 1342) was one of the three daughters of Gilbert de Clare, 3rd Earl of Gloucester and his wife, Joan of Acre. and thus a granddaughter of King Edward I of England.<br>
<br>
She was married to Piers Gaveston, the favorite of her uncle Edward II, in October 1307. According to the Vita Edwardi Secundi, this marriage was arranged by the king "to strengthen Piers and surround him with friends." The marriage of such a high-born lady to a foreigner was not popular among the English nobility. They had one child:<br>
   1. Joan Gaveston, born probably January 12/18th, 1312, at York.<br>
<br>
King Edward threw a grand celebration after the birth of this child, complete with minstrels. However, Piers Gaveston was executed only six months later, leaving Margaret a widow with a small child. Her dower rights as Countess of Cornwall were disputed, and so King Edward instead assigned her Okham castle and other lands. She joined the royal household and in 1316 accompanied the king in his journey from London to York.<br>
<br>
Following the death of their brother, Gilbert de Clare, 8th Earl of Hertford, at the Battle of Bannockburn in 1314, Margaret and her sisters, Elizabeth and Eleanor de Clare each received a share of the inheritance. Margaret was now one of the co-heiresses to the vast Gloucester estate, and King Edward arranged a second marriage for her to another favorite, Hugh Audley.<br>
<br>
On April 28, 1317 Margaret de Clare wed Hugh Audley at Windsor Castle. They had one daughter:<br>
   1. Margaret Audley, born between January 1318 and November 1322.<br>
<br>
Hugh and Margaret were among the victims of their brother-in-law, Hugh the younger Despenser. In his rashness and greed for the Clare lands, he robbed Margaret of much of her rightful inheritance. In 1321, Hugh joined the other Marcher barons in looting, burning, and causing general devastation to Despenser's lands.<br>
<br>
Hugh was captured at the Battle of Boroughbridge in 1322, and was saved from a hanging thanks to the pleas of his wife. He was imprisoned, and two months later Margaret was sent to Sempringham priory. She remained there until 1326, when Hugh escaped prison and she was released from Sempringham. In the meantime, her daughter Joan Gaveston had been sent to Amesbury priory. A marriage was arranged for Joan with the son of Thomas Multon, but the girl died in early 1325.<br>
<br>
Hugh and Margaret were reunited sometime in 1326. In summer 1336, their only daughter, Margaret Audley, was abducted by Ralph Stafford, 1st Earl of Stafford. Her parents filed a complaint, but King Edward III of England supported Stafford. He appeased Hugh and Margaret by creating Hugh earl of Gloucester.<br>
<br>
Margaret died in April 1342 and her sister Elizabeth de Clare paid for prayers to be said for her soul at Tonbridge priory.<br>

Richard DE CLARE
<p>
<a name ="I007365"><b>[I007365]</b></a><br />
Richard de Clare, 4th Earl of Hertford was the son of Roger de Clare, 3rd Earl of Hertford and Maud de St. Hilary. More commonly known as the Earl of Clare, he had the moiety of the Giffard estates from his ancestor Rohese. He was present at the coronation of King Richard I at Westminster, 3 Sep 1189, and King John on 27 May 1199. He was also present at the homeage of King William of Scotland at Lincoln.<br>
He married (ca. 1172) Amice Fitz William, Countess of Gloucester (ca. 1160-1220), second daughter of William Fitz Robert, 2nd Earl of Gloucester, and Hawise de Beaumont. He sided with the Barons against King John, even though he had previously sworn peace with the King at Northampton, and his castle of Tonbridge was taken. He played a leading part in the negotiations for Magna Carta, being one of the twenty five Barons appointed as guardians. On 9 Nov 1215, he was one of the commissioners on the part of the Barons to negotiate the peace with the King. In 1215, his lands in counties Cambridge, Norfolk, Suffolk and Essex were granted to Robert de Betun. He and his son were among the Barons excommunicated by the Pope in 1215. He and wife Amice appear to have been separated prior to 1200.<br>

Richard DE CLARE
<p>
<a name ="I007314"><b>[I007314]</b></a><br />
Son of Gilbert de Clare, 5th Earl of Hertford and Isabel Marshall, daughter of William Marshall and Isabel de Clare. A year after he became of age, he was in an expedition against the Welsh. Through his mother he inherited a fifth part of the Marshall estates, including Kilkenny and other lordships in Ireland. In 1232 Richard was secretly married to Margaret (Megotta) de Burgh, daughter of Hubert de Burgh, Earl of Kent. Both bride and groom were aged about ten. Megotta died in November 1327. Before she had even died, the earl of Lincoln offered 5,000 marks to King Henry to secure Richard for his own daughter. This offer was accepted, and Richard was married secondly, on or before 25 January 1237, Maud de Lacy, daughter of the Surety John de Lacy and Margaret Quincy.<br>
<br>
He joined in the Barons' letter to the Pope in 1246 against the exactions of the Curia in England. He was among those in opposition to the King's half-brothers, who in 1247 visited England, where they were very unpopular, but afterwards he was reconciled to them.<br>
<br>
On April 1248, he had letters of protection for going over seas on a pilgrimage. At Christmas 1248, he kept his Court with great splendor on the Welsh border. In the next year he went on a pilgrimage to St. Edmund at Pontigny, returning in June. In 1252 he observed Easter at Tewkesbury, and then went across the seas to restore the honor of his brother William, who had been badly worsted in a tournament and had lost all his arms and horses. The Earl is said to have succeeded in recovering all, and to have returned home with great credit, and in September he was present at the Round Table tournament at Walden.<br>
<br>
In August 1252/3 the King crossed over to Gascony with his army, and to his great indignation the Earl refused to accompany him and went to Ireland instead. In August 1255 he and John Maunsel were sent to Edinburgh by the King to find out the truth regarding reports which had reached the King that his son-in-law, Alexander, King of Scotland, was being coerced by Robert de Roos and John Baliol. If possible, they were to bring the young King and Queen to him. The Earl and his companion, pretending to be the two of Roos's knights, obtained entry to Edinburgh Castle, and gradually introduced their attendants, so that they had a force sufficient for their defense. They gained access to the Scottish Queen, who made her complaints to them that she and her husband had been kept apart. They threatened Roos with dire punishments, so that he promised to go to the King.<br>
<br>
Meanwhile the Scottish magnates, indignant at their castle of Edinburgh's being in English hands, proposed to besiege it, but they desisted when they found they would be besieging their King and Queen. The King of Scotland apparently traveled South with the Earl, for on 24 September they were with King Henry III at Newminster, Northumberland. In July 1258 he fell ill, being poisoned with his brother William, as it was supposed, by his steward, Walter de Scotenay. He recovered but his brother died.<br>
<br>
Richard died at John de Griol's manor of Asbenfield in Waltham, near Canterbury, 15 July 1262, it being rumored that he had been poisoned at the table of Piers of Savoy. On the following Monday he was carried to Canterbury where a mass for the dead was sung, after which his body was taken to the canon's church at Tonbridge and interred in the choir. Thence it was taken to Tewkesbury and buried 28 July 1262, with great solemnity in the presence of two bishops and eight abbots in the presbytery at his father's right hand.<br>

From Wikipedia<br>
<br>
Known as "de Bienfaite", "de Clare", and "de Tonbridge". Accompanied his kinsman William the Conqueror into England, and was rewarded with no less than one hundred and seventy six lordships and large grants of land in England, including the right to build the castles of Clare and of Tonbridge, in return for his service at the Battle of Hastings, and general assistance in conquering the Saxon. Served as Joint Chief Justiciar in William's absence, and played a major part in suppressing the revolt of 1075.<br>
Richard took the name Earl of Clare from one of his lordships in Suffolk, where Clare Castle still exists. The modern Irish county of County Clare was historically part of the North Munster Gaelic kingdom of Thomond, dominated by the O'Briens, Kings of Thomond. The region was granted to the De Clare family in 1275 and they became Lords of Thomond. When the boundaries of the modern County Clare were fixed by Sir Henry Sidney in 1565, it was named after the De Clares.<br>
His parents were Gilbert "Crispin", Count of Brionne and his mistress Constance de Eu. Gilbert was married to Gunnora d'Aunou, and some sources list her as Richards mother. Richard's father is also sometimes listed as Robert I "the Devil", father of William the Conqueror. Sources as far back as the Annals of the Four Masters claim that Richard's great grandson, Richard "Strongbow", was the direct descendant of Robert "the Devil". Gilbert "Crispin" is a descendant of Robert's cousin, but not Robert himself. One thing can be sure, Richard was a close and trusted friend of the King.<br>
