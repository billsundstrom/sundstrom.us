<a name ="I108571"><b>[I108571]</b></a><br />
Helen Levitov Sobell -- whose former husband Morton Sobell was a co- defendant in the Rosenberg spy trial -- has died.<br>
Mrs. Sobell died Monday in a Redwood City nursing home after a long battle with Alzheimer's disease. She was 84.<br>
Mrs. Sobell was best known for her long and vocal campaign to free her husband, who was arrested in 1950 and later sentenced to 30 years in prison for conspiracy to commit espionage.<br>
For 18 years, she traveled the world, speaking, coordinating volunteers and directing picket lines. At first, she campaigned to save the lives of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, who were convicted of selling atomic secrets to the Soviet Union. They were executed in 1953.<br>
Subsequently, she fought on behalf of her husband, who served his term on Alcatraz Island and later at Atlanta Federal Prison.<br>
"We were both dealt a hand, and we made the most of it," said Morton Sobell ,<br>
who at 85 lives in San Francisco. "I didn't just go to prison and fade away. She was out there fighting."<br>
Mrs. Sobell 's activities, during the Joseph McCarthy period, brought her under the scrutiny of the FBI. Her daughter, Sydney Gurewitz Clemens, said the FBI had collected reams and reams of files about Mrs. Sobell , which the family later obtained through the Freedom of Information Act.<br>
"We knew we'd been followed. Our phones were tapped," Clemens said. "She had more pages of FBI records about her than all kinds of famous people."<br>
In 1957, a Moscow spy testified that he had been directed by his superiors to hire Mrs. Sobell to spy for the Soviet Union, but that he had failed to carry out the assignment. At the time, Mrs. Sobell denied ever having anything to do with espionage and called the accusations "an attempt by government prosecutors to smear me and my husband."<br>
She was born in Washington, D.C., in 1918 and contracted polio as a teen. She trained as a teacher.<br>
In 1938, she married Clarence Darrow Gurewitz and had a daughter. During World War II, she worked at the Bureau of Standards as a spectrometer technician.<br>
In 1945, she divorced Gurewitz and married Morton Sobell . They moved to Schenectady, N.Y., where both worked at General Electric. In 1947, they moved to New York City, where they later had a son. In 1950, she received a master's degree in physics from Columbia University.<br>
That summer, the family fled to Mexico. It was there that Morton Sobell -- a former member of the Communist Party -- was arrested.<br>
At that point, her daughter recalled, "she was confronted with what to her was an absolute injustice. So she did the work in front of her."<br>
When her husband was released early for good behavior in 1969, Mrs. Sobell told reporters she felt ecstatic. She said, "Morton plans to go back to college and . . . spend the rest of his life proving his innocence."<br>
She then enrolled in Teachers College and Columbia University and received her doctorate in computer education in 1980, at the age of 62.<br>
That same year, she and Morton Sobell separated. They divorced the next year.<br>
Mrs. Sobell moved to San Francisco in 1981 and taught for a year at Contra Costa College before retiring. She was active with the Gray Panthers of San Francisco and a now-defunct organization called Options for Women Over 40.<br>
In addition to her daughter, Sydney Gurewitz Clemens of San Francisco, she is survived by her son, Mark Sobell , of Menlo Park; a sister, Edith Garduk of Bethesda, Md.; two brothers, David Levitov of Silver Spring, Md., and Joseph Levitov, of Boca Raton, Fla.; five grandchildren and two great-grandchildren.<br>
