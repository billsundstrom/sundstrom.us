Robert Melvin MCCLURE
<p>
<a name ="I053964"><b>[I053964]</b></a><br />
Robert Melvin McClure, 93, passed away on June 11, 2014, at his home. <br>
Bob was born in 1920 to Arthur and Julia McClure in Bellevue, Ohio. He spent his childhood in Ohio and Michigan. Interests that would shape Bob's life were evident early on; the 10-year old who built a small canard airplane from wood shingles retired as an aeronautical engineer 50 years later. <br>
Captivated by flight, Bob enrolled in the California Flyers School of Avionics in 1941. There, he learned principles of engineering which he used at Consolidated Vultee Aircraft in San Diego during WWII. Toward the end of the war, Bob enlisted in the Army and was stationed  in Fort Ord, Calif.; a serendipitous assignment, as that is where he met Margie Bexell -- a WAC sergeant who would become his wife of 64 years.<br>
Bob and Marge moved to Southern California in 1948 where he landed a job as draftsman/designer with North American Aviation. He felt fortunate to work in the aeronautics field during an exciting time of technological ideas and advancements. Bob retired as engineering group leader after 31 years, a career beginning with the F-86 Sabre and concluding with the B-1 Lancer.<br>
Shortly after retiring in 1979, Bob and Marge moved to Post Falls, Idaho. They loved the mountains, rivers, lakes and the snow. Together, they enjoyed hiking and local travel while Bobʼs leisure included boating, fishing and woodworking. <br>
Community involvement was also very important to Bob and Marge, especially with the Post Falls Library. Bob served on the Board of Directors and helped found Friends of the Post Falls Library -- a group instrumental in the buildingʼs renovation. As a nod to their volunteerism in the Post Falls community, April 21, 2001, was proclaimed by the mayor as Bob and Marge McClure Day. They were also surprised and honored when the library named two board rooms after them.<br>
Most notable about Bob is this: He dedicated his life to his family. Bob and Marge raised five children, and he poured the same creative, innovative energy that he had as a child into his own childrenʼs lives. Camping or cross-country road trips were typical vacations, and a day at the coast or in the canoe were good ways to spend a weekend. <br>
Bob was very proud of his grandchildren, and he loved sharing the northwest experience with them -- sledding, fishing, and water skiing. He was a life-long learner, and this is a legacy that he left to his entire family.<br>
Bob was preceded in death by the love of his life, Marge McClure. He is survived by his daughter and son-in-law, Kathy and Mike; daughter and son-in-law, Robin and Michael; son and daughter-in-law, John and Holly; daughter and son-in-law, Ann Marie and Gary; son and daughter-in-law, Jim and Debbie; 12 grandchildren, 24 great grandchildren; and his brother and sister-in-law, Dick and Betty.<br>
He will be -- and already is -- greatly missed.<br>

I have a Lucy Catherine McColl, born to Neal McColl and Susanna Frances<br>
Tupper.  She was listed as a daughter in the will of Susan Tupper McColl. I<br>
have a birth date of 26 December 1883, but unfortunately I forgot to note its<br>
source.  I would assume I got it from the 1901 census, and will double-check<br>
my records and get back to you. There are a number of people researching this<br>
family including Edd Sinnett who posts to various boards frequently.  There is<br>
also a very extensive descendant list for this family at Bill's Blog -<br>
http://bill.sundstrom.us - he includes a Lucy Catherine McColl for Neal and<br>
Susanna born 1884.<br>
I didn't know that Lucy  had moved to Winnipeg, so thank you for that update.<br>
