Written 19 June 2011 by William Sundstrom<br>
My dad died today.<br>
Sadly and ironically today is Father's Day.<br>
My mother and father divorced when I was two years old. He always lived far away from me. We would meet a few times each year when he returned to Minnesota for business or on vacation. Despite the distance, I always felt close to dad. I loved him and I knew he loved me. From the age of seven to sixteen, I spent three months every summer with my dad's parents, Anna and Simon. Almost every summer, while at grandpa's farm, my dad would bring his family to the farm for a visit. So, maybe that is why I always felt so close to him.<br>
Those were not the only times that we spent together. Memorable to me was the summer of 1965, when I lived with his family in Montgomery, AL. And the month he spent with me in 1970. We had a good time. He was lots of fun and he got to meet many of my friends. Over the years, I often visited him in Mississippi and I tried to visit for a week or two. In the spring of 2008, I spent a couple of months with him.<br>
I loved the stories my dad would tell. Everyone agrees that you could spin a great yarn. He had stories about friends and family. He had stories about business. He never failed to put me in a good mood when he told a story, even when I had heard it before. When I became a pilot, he would tell me stories about his friends who were pilots. When we traveled we shared stories about travel. And I always enjoyed his stories about his days as a boy in South Dakota. He also had some great stories about business. I especially liked his stories about his business in Japan. He had been a long-time customer of Japanese porcelain, but in the 1980's he started selling container loads of high-quality waterless cookware to the Japanese consumer market.<br>
In recent years, his proudest stories were about Camp Victor in Ocean Springs. He did a lot to help the people of Ocean Springs recover from the Hurricane Katrina. Camp Victor was the Lutheran church's key vehicle to help with the rebuilding of the gulf coast. Camp Victor provided accommodations for thousand of volunteers from all over the USA and Canada. The camp also was a center to receive millions of dollars worth of building materials. Dad played a critical role in the start up and continuation of Camp Victor.<br>
<br>
My dad loved his family and family stories. Perhaps that is why he became an avid genealogist. He introduced me to his hobby and we shared all of our tricks and methods to find information about our family tree. He also helped reestablish strong contacts with our Swedish cousins. He had visited them and they visited him several times. He often wrote and shared pictures with our cousins in Sweden.<br>
I loved my dad so much. I will greatly miss him.<br>
I wrote a brief obituary for my dad this morning. It follows:<br>
Martin Sidney "Sid" Sundstrom, 84, of Ocean Springs, MS, died early this morning at St. Mary's Hospital in Rochester, MN, from pneumonia contracted during his recovery from heart surgery.<br>

He enlisted and served in the US Army during World War II. He was wounded while serving in Okinawa. Soon after returning to civilian life, he began a life-long career as salesman and then a sales executive. The career led him and his family to many places, including Indianapolis, Niagara Falls, Chicago, West Bend, Montgomery, Birmingham, and finally in 1970 to Ocean Springs where he lived the rest of his life. Sid was an active member of Christus Victor Lutheran Church. He play a significant role in the establishment of Camp Victor, which has been a leader in the recovery from hurricane Katrina. He was well-known and well-liked in the Ocean Springs community.<br>
Sidney Sundstrom was warm and loving husband, father and grandfather. He will greatly missed by his family and friends and the Ocean Springs community.<br>
Sid Sundstrom married twice. From the first union came his sons, Bill and Brian. Sid married LaVera Isabelle Dulitz at Brownsdale, MN, 30 December 1951. LaVera died in 2006. Sid and LaVera had four children: Katherine, Steven, Dawn and Ann.<br>
Sidney is survived by all his children and their spouses: Bill and Betty; Brian and Judy of Orono, MN; Katherine Sundstrom of Connecticut; Steven and Ellen of La Crosse, WI; Dawn Sundstrom and partner, Mitzi Griffin, of Greensboro, NC; and Ann Tietel of Port Washington, NY.

And he is survived by eight great-grandchildren: Athena, Ebin, Eva, Annika, Johanna, Lucianna, Abbie and Judah. He is survived by his brother Vernon Sundstrom of Madelia, MN, and his sister Elinor Daugherty of New Ulm, MN.<br>

Obituary:<br>
Death of N. J. Sundstrom<br>
Up in the northern part of Sweden near the Artic Circle there are three large rivers that traverse that country in a southeasterly direction and empty into the Gulf of Bothnia.  Their names are Tornea, Lulea and Pitea.  Three cities of the same names are found where the respective rivers lose their identity in that mighty gulf.<br>
Numerous people from the Lulea district immigrated to the Unites States during the early '70s and settled in the northeastern part of Glenwood township, Clay county, and in the eastern and southern part of Brooklyn township, Lincoln county, across the line from Clay.  The Sundstrom ant the Soderstrom families, who settled there, were all related in one way or another and they in turn intermarried with the Olof Linds, the Norins and Heglin families, and today their descendants number perhaps hundreds.  On last Thursday, March 16, one of the largest funerals took place in the Brooklyn church, northwest of Beresford.  It was that of N. J. Sundstrom, a resident of Brooklyn township since 1888, who died Sunday afternoon, March 12, after an illness of only a couple weeks, pneumonia being the cause of death.  Services were conducted by pastor of the church, Rev. Glen Nelson, assisted by Rev. Fred Nelson, in the Swedish language.  The church was filled to overflowing.  Interment was made in the Brooklyn cemetery.<br>
N. J. Sundstrom was born Oct. 14, 1862, in Lulea district in Sweden, and came to this country in 1880, landing first in Indiana where he remained until in 1883 when a sister and two brothers arrived and they came to Dakota, where the deceased homesteaded in Douglas county.<br>
His father and mother arrived here later, as well as his other sisters, in all seven brothers and four sisters.  In 1886 he purchased the farm where he lived until death.  In 1895 he was united in marriage to Adina Soderstrom of Glenwood township, who with a daughter and three grandchildren besides a host of relatives and friends mourn the snatching away of a man known far and wide in these parts of the country.  N. J. was one of the foremost to organize and promote the Brooklyn congregation of the Swedish Mission church and particularly of the building of the present church edifice, a brick structure in 1917, one of the largest county churches in this part of the state.  He was a man known for his kind and upright dealings with his fellowman, of exemplary habits and friend to all who came within his sphere of influence.  The immediate friends and the community in which he lived will experience a vacant space by his departure.<br>

EARLY PIONEER LIFE as told by OSCAR SUNDSTROM to Gordon Sundstrom about 1933<br>
We came to America, landed in New York, in the spring of 1871. It took us 18 days on the ocean, the last 3 days we were without water for drinking.<br>
From there we went to Grand Rapids, Michigan and then on to Chicago. In the spring of 1872, my father went on to Sioux City, Woodbury, IA, as that was as far as the railroad went. From Sioux City he went up to Dakota and came up to where Glenwood now is and looked at the land. Then he went back to Sioux City and wrote for mother and the children to come, the family consisting of four boys and three girls. The two oldest girls stayed in Chicago and worked. As soon as we came, my father and my three brothers, all being of age then, came up here and filed for the homestead and land for each of the boys. My father took the homestead for me as I was too young - only 7 years of age. This was as far north as the country was settled at that time.<br>
The law was that you had to have some kind of a home built on the land filed within the next 6 months. We made our dugout, which was fourteen feet square, in the side of a hill by the creek which is now called Ash Creek. The roof was out of four studdings with willow branches over the top to fasten the slough hay onto and over that - we put sod.<br>
While we were digging the dugout, an Indian came riding up to us on his pony and stood and looked at us. He tried to make us understand by pointing around. Just as soon as I saw he was an Indian, I made one jump into the hole of the dugout, too scared to stop to see what he would do.<br>
Father bought a yoke of oxen by Elk Point [S.D]. We hitched these steers to a stone boat and on this stone boat were a breaking plow and some grub. I could not ride on these steers. [They] were not broken to drive so had to walk and lead them. My father and I walked all the way up from Sioux City.<br>
We met a man up near the homestead, who had a yoke of oxen. He broke ten acres for us five for my father and five for my brother - for the use of our steers so he could break up land for himself. Father planted sod corn, but got no crop that year. Father and I walked back to Sioux City. [Approximately 50 miles] We walked forty miles the first day to a stopping place, called the Fourteen Mile house. We got to Sioux City early the next morning. Talk about a happy boy and that was me when we were going home to Mother and the others. I was so sure we could walk the whole way down in one day that I kept telling Father to walk faster. He never discouraged me but told me we would see. I slept so hard that Father could hardly wake me the next morning. When he tried to put my shoes on, I woke up as my feet had big blisters on them. I walked barefooted that day and when I got to Sioux City I got a new pair of shoes. They were the prettiest shoes you ever saw, may not have been as stylish as they have now, but they were made without a flaw in my eyes.<br>
We stayed in Sioux City over winter. The next spring [1873] Father bought a pair of ponies, real Indian ponies that we drove when we moved up here. We had a cow that we led with us. There were no roads so we drove angling across the bottom, north of Elk Point. It started to rain and thunder towards evening so we stopped and asked to stay all night but they refused, so we went on. After dark we came to a Norwegian farmer who let us stay there. We stayed there three days - as the bottom was flooded.<br>
It took us two days to get to the homestead. The weather turned real cold and we had cold rainy weather. It being early spring, we had no shelter for the oxen - two ponies and the cow.<br>
My brother took the ponies to a farmer south of us who had a straw barn. To save the oxen and the cow from freezing to death, we took them into the dugout with us [overnight]. In those days the homes were never to small but what there was room for some body else - man or beast - to get sheltered in. They tied these critters to our beds where we slept. Remember now that doesn't mean beds like [we] have now days - just plain straw for mattress.<br>
Father sowed in 10 acres of wheat and broke up forty acres - ten on each quarter to have ready to sow in the spring.<br>
Next came the hardship of getting hay for the five animals. Had to go six miles to a school section northwest of home where there were some sloughs. First there had first choice and by that would hurry and  cut around the patch making it as large as he thought necessary to his full supply.<br>
One farmer had a reaper and cut all of [the] neighbor's grain around while they did the binding. Kept me busy carrying water for the men as sometimes I had a half mile to walk and get the water. My wages were fifty cents a day, providing I got my pay from all.<br>
After sowing in the wheat it was customary to break up "fire guards" as they were called, by plowing around each quarter to prevent prairie fires from burning up homes.<br>
There was not enough grass to amount to anything on the higher levels of ground, only in draws and creeks there would be a little moisture in the soil, could be found a little grass. That meant picketing and herding the stock and naturally me being the smallest, I got the job.<br>
A neighbor helped my father and brothers stack the grain and then they helped him. They got two stacks of grain each so they put them all together to make a "sitting" as it was called so as to save the man who threshed for them from moving his machine twice. That fall after harvesting and stacking, they, father and brothers, built a shed out of poles, willows, and put the threshed straw over it.<br>
The winters were severe, as there was nothing on the bare prairies to stop the snow from blowing around. These snowstorms most generally lasted three days, making them real blizzards. The doors on the dugout had to be made to open inwards, because during these snowstorms the snow would drift up so high that you had to tunnel your way out. It was very difficult to find your way out to the barn to do chores.<br>
The wood supply for winter was hauled from either Vermillion [S.D.] or Elk Point. If you had anything to sell you took it with you and then went to the woods, cut your own wood and drove home. Hauling was surely a nice cold task when the trip was so far. It was not a bit unusual to have to stop at several places to have your frozen limbs thawed out. My mother and I picked leaves and whatever we could find to burn along the creek.<br>
The only flour mills were along the Vermillion River at Bloomingdale and later one a Lodi, which became a country village, consisting of a post office, drugstore, grocery store, blacksmith shop and a saloon. At first we had to go to Vermillion to get our mail. We certainly didn't get our mail every day then as we do now. Later, there was a flour mill at Riverside and then on in Centerville - a little below where Centerville is now.<br>
The common custom of traveling to go and visit the neighbors or friends was to get in and sit in the wagon box as even spring seats were not in style yet. The boys would ride horseback and the girls would walk to go and visit each other, unless the distance was to far. They didn't call it far if it was within five miles. That's what you don't call it even by [can not read the last word].<br>
In the spring of 1874 they put in a crop, and it grew and looked real nice. To our disappointment came the grasshoppers and destroyed the crop. Not only did they come this one, year, but, they came for five consecutive years. Now is when the real hard times came and it looked more discouraging than ever before, as there were no means or credit to get anything. The poor had to stay and the rich were not there. Our meals mostly consisted of homemade hard tack, mush and cornmeal bread. Didn't know of what vitamins we needed or what calories we should have, we were only too glad to get something into our stomachs that would keep us from starving.<br>
In the year 1875 they took apart the house in Sioux City that was made of cottonwood lumber and hauled it up here and rebuilt the house. This house was far from being tight and warm in the winter, but to us we thought it was swell in comparison to the dugout. Many a winter morning we woke up with an extra blanket on - not a woolen blanket, but one of snow.<br>
The first school I attended was in a homestead shanty for only two or three months in summer. Here we learned reading, writing, spelling and arithmetic. Later I went to school in Lincoln County, which is now called Brooklyn school. My friend, James Palmer and  I dug a hole in the side of the creek bank and put up a few poles, made a roof covered with straw which lasted for 2 winters. This was a barn for his team and my team.<br>
Church services were held in houses at first. The nearest church was [in] Dalesburg, [S.D.], later the one in Komstad.[ S.D.]<br>
The first fair held in Vermillion my friend, James Palmer, and I rode horse back down. We had fifty cents each to spend and the fee to enter was a quarter, so didn't have much to spend foolishly. Went home the next day as we had no money, but we were two happy lads just the same.<br>
And the first 4th of July celebration in the north part of the county was at what was called Broad Grove by the Vermillion River. Some came with oxen, some with horse wagons, some on horseback and others on foot. No buggies in sight as they were not in style yet. The lightest traveling vehicle was a wagon.<br>
Grasshopper time made land so cheap, as there was the Black Hills Gold Rush at that time. A few around got excited and sold out to go out there and get rich quick. One man sold his timber [800 acres] that was all proved up, one for forty bushels of wheat and another, his for one hundred twenty five bushels of wheat. Grain must be ever so much higher priced to what it is now or otherwise land was awfully cheap. My sister helped some of these families take up this hard tack bread to take with them as they had a hard journey ahead of them.<br>
Some years later my father and I drove up to Sioux Falls [S.D.] with some hogs. It took two days as we got stuck in the mud. It was a long way to go but we heard prices were best there so that was the reason why. The prices were two cents a pound. I don't see how they could have been much less to be able to sell instead of giving them away. My father and I never expected to get any warm meals. We were supposed to take our own grub with us. In the winter it would freeze so hard we could hardly eat it. There were a few places where one could buy a cup a hot coffee, which was anything but delicious. Our real treat on the homeward trip was a nickels worth of bologna and a nickels worth of sweet crackers, providing you had the dime to buy it with.<br>
In 1876 the Post Office was established on the homestead east of our home, later moving to our home. Here the mail would be distributed, the mail carriers coming over once or twice a week. Many a snowstorm they had to stay over, as they would be snowbound for a couple days at that time.<br>
And on and on the story goes, but from now on each year progressed a little more as gradually the hardships of pioneer life were made easier until up to the present time, where little of that hardship can be realized.<br>
