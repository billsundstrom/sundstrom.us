Chester Clarence CLEWETT
<p>
<a name ="I002032"><b>[I002032]</b></a><br />
Per Claude Armstrong:<br>
As for my Clewett grandparents, my mother made a large scrapbook photo and illustration record of their "Caravan" move from the back-breaking labor of creating cirus groves in San Fernando Valley to a twenty acre plot the Oakdale Irrigation District opened up for settlers to farm, and thereby develop  the fertile San Joaquin Valley of Central California, in the mid-twenties. As it turned out, that miserable soil was very shallow topsoil sitting on a bed of hardpan, and and all but barely manageable as irrigated farmland. They nicknamed it "Boot-shovel" after years of hard-labor farming it, and losing. Grandpa then bought and developed a state-of-the-art goat dairy in Ripon, in the heart of Central California Wine Country. He was deeply Quacker-oriented [Friends Church], and a complete tee-totaler! As babies arrived after me, mom used to have dad take us the twenty-some miles to grandpa and grandma's little three or so acre goat dairy [They managed to have as many as 120 milking nannies  there!], and my brother and I would spend many, many three to ? weeks in their care. The fall-out from that detachment from my home raised major havoc with my sense of allegiance the rest of my days - so far!<br>
The Central California major highway, Highway 99, ran just a few hundred feet away, as did the main Central California railroad, next to the highway. On many occasions I remember arriving at my grandparents to find a hobo living there, doing some contrived odd-jobs, for grandma's cooking, which was carefully stored for after they left on the numerous passing freight trains. Grandpa was ever so mindful of his own wretched-poor beginnings, and had established a name among the poor traveling homeless as a place of welcome, for an exchange of small labor favors. The dairy was state-of-the-art concrete and stainless steel milk-piping, but it only afforded an eked-out financial existence all their many years there. Their main food staples came in the form of grocery store trimmings, almond huller wastes, and fruit packing house discards. Even so, I always remember them buying 5+ five-gallon square tins of honey to sweeten all grandma's wonderful baked goods, including the most awesome bread I've ever tasted, except for the equally-awesome bread my children's mom produced!<br>
And, ice goat milk? I can recall no better-tasting milk treat! Grandpa had a pre-chiller that the incoming stainless steel milk pipes emptied onto, with a commercial refrigerator running to maintain its coolth. The fresh, warm milk ran down its horizontal corrugated sides, chilling it to about 40 degrees, or so, just before it was fed into those old Galvanized bulk milk cans . . .<br>
 . . . From the "Milk Room," grandpa tipped each filled, heavy 10-gallon can and rolled them into a large cold-storage room to keep till the goat dairy co-op route truck backed into the raised dock to pick up however many milkings'-worth of milk was there. They had several centrifugal cream separators in the milk parlor, but I never saw them in use, and I really doubt they were used. Oh! that iced goat milk? As the milk ran over the very cold pre-chiller, over time the thinner milk at the ends of the corrugated chiller would freeze. All I had to do was chip off some flakes, and suck on them like an icicle. Yum!<br>
I've many, many memories of grandpa and grandma Clewett's visits! Dad's parents died when he was young, his mom when he was just two, and he was ten when his dear old, worn-to-the-bone father just gave up on living, in the most barren place I've ever been to, Elida, New Mexico. Perhaps the Chaco Canyon region is as barren, but at least high-desert sage grows there! Dad's stories of the horrors of a Star Route Mail Carrier, which his father took as a new immigrant, hoping for a better life from the serfdom of 19th century, industrialized England - well, that's another, long, long story!<br>
My folks were survivors! How I wish I'd respected and honored my dear parents before it was too late to do so. Mom passed just after my birthday, Feb 19, 2008 - I dreamed with a vivid scene of dad singing a beautiful solo that night, and I rarely, if ever, dreamed anything with my dad in it. Dad had gone on in the Fall of 1984, just days before Grandma Clewett passed over. He was 77; she, 93, the same age as my mom at her passing. <br>

<a name ="I002115"><b>[I002115]</b></a><br />
Married the love of my life, Nadine, in 1958 while I was at UCLA working on my engineering degree.  Best decision I've ever made!  We have two children.  Leslie is a school teacher here in Arizona and David is an engineering manager with the FAA in Los Angeles.<br>
I went to work for Northrop in Anaheim after graduation and attended night school to get my masters in Aerospace Management from USC.  When the aerospace slowdown hit in the 70's, I decided to change to a more stable profession, teaching.  After 21 years I retired from Anaheim High School where I had taught math and computer science.<br>
My hobbies over the years have included building street rods, restoring old Fords, flying and politics.  Now that we are retired here in the Phoenix area we enjoy playing golf, travel and going out with friends.  Life is great!<br>

Ebenezer Hugo CLEWETT
<p>
<a name ="I014349"><b>[I014349]</b></a><br />
Grave Inscription:<br>
Ebenezer Clewett served as first grand tiler of the Grand Lodge Free and Accepted Masons of Wisconsin from his appointment in 1845 until his death in 1872...<br>
<br>
Hi Rachel,<br>
My name is Linda Larson. I am Howard Clewett's daughter and the keeper of the records in this family. Dad forwarded The information that I have on Ebenezer is from a photo of his grave marker. His birthdate was listed as March 19, 1799. He died 1 May 1872 and is buried near Middleton, Wisconsin. He was a Grand Mason there at one time and his grave has often been tended to by non family members. I understand that his sword and other memorabilia are stashed somewhere in the smithsonian. Lydia was according to her own account 19 years Ebenezer's junior. They had 13 children. Ebenezer settled in the Madison and Middleton areas of Wisconsin. Rumor has it that Lydia was rather tough. She was known to have run a bear up a tree and kept it there while the boys were hunting. After the birth of the 13th child. They older boys are said to have run Ebenezer off because he kept getting Lydia pregnant. After Ebenezer's death most of the family disbursed. Many of them ending !<br>
up in Southern California. My branch being one of those. Ebenezer emigrated to Montreal, quebec, canada. He married at Barton Church, 4 miles from Hamilton Canada west by the rev George G. Giddies on the 8th of January 1838... this text taken from old family bible. Ebenezer is known to have married before Lydia in London England to a woman named Elizabeth Ralby. They had at least 3 children together and as of yet I have not discovered the reason that he left London... only that family members from England were said to have placed advertisements in the Wisconsin papers trying to locate him and he forbid Lydia from answering any of the inquiries. I have recently connected with others from Lydia's family. Descendants from nearly all of her siblings. I am happy to copy and send whatever information you are interested in. In the meantime. Your name is not familiar in my records. How are you descendant from George? I just looked, couldn't find a Rachel in the bunch. !<br>
Ebenezer's birth and christening I found in church records at an LDS l<br>
ibrary. He christened at Providence Chapel, St. Marylebone, London England on the 15th April 1799. From there I researched through old films until I found his birth. John (hugo) Clewett married Adeliza Holmes at St. George Hanover in London England in 1790. I know I have the exact date down but not in front of me. Adeliza was christened 17 Oct 1770. Her parents were Thomas Holmes and Addiliza Hutchinson. As further proof of this connection Ebenezer named his first child from his second marriage Addelaide and they always called her Addie. She was the only one to remain in the Middleton Wisconsin area when the rest of the family left and her descendants are still there today.<br>
I hope to hear back from you.<br>
<br>
Sincerely,<br>
Linda Larson<br>

<p>
<a name ="I071006"><b>[I071006]</b></a><br />
Charles Frederick Clifford, of Northfield, was born in Stockton, Me., February 17, 1847, and at the age of eight years came west to Minnesota with his parents, Jonathan L. and Susan B. (French) Clifford, in 1855. They pre-empted 160 acres of land in Stanton township, Goodhue county, and cleared and cultivated this farm until in 1873, when the father moved to Cannon Falls and lived a retired life until his death in 1878. The mother died in 1901. There were seven children in the Clifford home: Samuel, who died of yellow fever in the West Indies; Arthur T., of Cannon Falls; Mrs. Willard Kenyon, of Raymond, Neb.; John (deceased) was formerly in business at Northfield; Everett F., of Wabasha, Minn.; Charles, the subject of this sketch, and Albion L., of Cannon Falls. Arthur T. and John were soldiers in the Civil War, the former serving in the First Regiment, Heavy Artillery, and the latter in Company F, Eighth Minnesota Volunteer Infantry. Charles F. remained at home, and in 1872 took charge of the farm, which he afterward purchased. He carried on a general line of farming, and also engaged in stock raising to a considerable extent. In 1894 he rented the farm and moved to Northfield, having purchased a small farm of forty acres within the city limits, where he has since resided. While a resident of Stanton township he served as treasurer and was also a member of the school board of his district for many years. April 5, 1873, Mr. Clifford was united in marriage to Jeanette Whitson, a native of Smith Falls, Ontario, and was born November 8, 1848, daughter of Robert and Mary (Riddle) Whitson. The father was born in Edinborough, Scotland in 1827, and the mother was born in Canada April 19, 1828. In 1863 they came to Minnesota and settled in Stanton township, where the father died July 7, 1889. Two years later the mother moved to Northfield, where she passed away February 10, 1904.

Gwaithfoed ap CLODIEN
<p>
<a name ="I009804"><b>[I009804]</b></a><br />
From the notes below there appears to be a difference of opinion about when Gwaithfoed lived. Harold died 1066 (of course), which fits with Gwaithfoed's death date of 1057. But Edgar lived from 943 to 975, so if he was contemporary with both, he lived a long and prosperous life, marrying both early and very late in life.<br>
<br>
Gwaethfoed, Lord of Cardigan and Gwynfai (d 1057), lived in the time of Harold the Saxon; m. Morfydd, dau. of Ivor (or Ynyr), King of Gwent, and one of his heirs. [Annals and Antiquities of Wales II:208]<br>
<br>
______________________<br>
<br>
Gwaethvoed was contemporary with Edgar, king of Saxons, and was, in conformity with the vassalage of those periods, summoned, with other Welsh chieftains, by Edgar, to meet him at Chester, to row him, in his royal barge, on the river Dee, in proof of his fealty. Gwaethvoed, in answer to his summons, said he could not row, and that he would not, if he could, except it were to save a person's life, whether king or vassal. Edgar sent a second and very imperious message, which Gwaethvoed did not seem at all to notice, until the messenger begged to know what reply he should deliver to the king; when Gwaethevoed, in the Welsh language, answered thus: 'Say to him, fear him who fears not death.: This stern reply, discovering at once to Edgar the fearless unbending character he had to deal with, he prudently changed his autocratic decree into a desire of mutual friendship, and going to Gwaethvoed, gave the chief his hand in pledge of his sincerity. Gwaethvoed married Morfydd, one of the daughters and co-heirs of Ivor, king or lord of Gwent. [Burke's Commoners III:387]<br>
