Thursday evening, August 17, it was my privilege to officiate at a quiet wedding ceremony held in our home here at South Lancaster. Enar Gottfred Hallgren, formerly of Gardner, but more recently of Northampton, Mass., and Miss Eloise Cynthia Hoxie, of Northampton were united in marriage. The bridal party consisted of the parents and near relatives of the groom, the brother of the bride and a few close friends. Mr. and Mrs. Hallgren will make their home at Northampton, where Brother Hallgren is engaged in farming. Both are members of the Northampton church. We wish them a happy experience as they build their new home. <br>
