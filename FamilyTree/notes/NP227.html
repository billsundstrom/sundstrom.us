<p>
<a name ="I081556"><b>[I081556]</b></a><br />
Fairfield, Montana - Rodney K. Hanson, age 92, passed away peacefully with his family by his side on May 31, 2013 at St. Peter's Hospital in Helena, Montana. Rod was born Sept. 1, 1920 to John and Nellie Hanson in Fort Benton, Montana. He spent his childhood on the family farm in Highwood with his three brothers, Kenneth, Maurice, and Loren and his sister, Janice. After attending Montana State College for one year, he went to work for Sun River Electric, a local rural electric cooperative, in Fairfield, Montana in 1940, where he met the love of his life, Eunice Bailey. They were married on Sept. 6, 1942. Just last year, Rod and Eunice celebrated 70 wonderful years of marriage with their friends and daughters.<br>
Rod and Eunice initially lived in Pendroy, Mt. until June of 1944 when he was inducted into the Navy during World War II. Rod was stationed at Honolulu, Hawaii and Saipan before being honorably discharged in March, 1946. Shortly thereafter he was hired as the manager of Butte Electric Co-op in Newell, South Dakota and continued to serve as an REA manager for the next 40 years, serving at Sun River Electric in Fairfield, Montana since 1957 until his retirement in 1985. Due to his exemplary management skills and winning personality, Rod was asked to serve as an interim manager and restore order to numerous troubled electric co-operatives during retirement, but Rod and Eunice's home always remained in Fairfield.<br>
Rod was a very giving person, never complaining, but always looking out for others. He belonged to many community organizations including Lion's Club, Kiwanis, serving as a church trustee, and a school board member. He was instrumental in establishing the Fairfield swimming pool and worked alongside Eunice to start the Fairfield Drop-In Center. Rod was elected to the Montana Constitutional Convention in 1972, where he helped to re-write the States' constitution. He always believed in doing good because it was the right thing to do-not for the recognition. He was well thought of in his community and throughout the state by those who worked with him. Rod was an example of honesty, integrity, and hard work to his family and friends. <br>
Rod was preceded in death by his parents, brothers, and sister. He is survived by his wife, Eunice, and four daughters; Sharon (Jim) Jeffery of Grangeville, Idaho, Charlene (Mike) Gustafson of Billings, Mt., Linda (Dick) Norden of Boulder, Mt., and Debra (Game) McGimsey of Eagle River, Alaska. He is also survived by 10 grandchildren and 12 great-grandchildren.<br>

A reception will be held following the services in the fellowship hall of the United Church of Christ.<br>

The Hervarar  saga deals with the cursed sword Tyrfing and how it was forged and cursed by the Dwarves Dvalin and Durin for king Svafrlami. Later, he lost it to the beserker Arngrim from Bolmsö who gave it to his son Angantyr. Angantyr died during a fight on Samsø against the Swedish hero Hjalmar, whose friend Orvar-Odd buried the cursed sword in a barrow together with Angantyr. From the barrow it was retrieved by Angantyr's daughter, the shieldmaiden Hervor who summoned her dead father to claim her inheritance. Then the saga continues with her and her son Heidrek, the king of Reidgotaland. Between his sons Angantyr and Hlod, there is a great battle about their father's heritage and Hlod is aided by the Huns. However, Hlod is defeated and killed.<br>
<br>
