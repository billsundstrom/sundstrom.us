Timothy Michael SMITH
<p>
<a name ="I046872"><b>[I046872]</b></a><br />
Memorial written by Tim's mother:<br>
Timmy was born on September 20, 1982 at 00:20 he weight 5lb 7oz. Small but Mighty, he was a tough little guy and wanted to know everything in the World.<br>
He has a younger brother, Tommy and younger sister, Jackie, who he looked after and loved so much.<br>
Timmy was very popular, the phone rang off the hook every weekend, and he just walked into a room and it lit up.<br>
His Laugh!! OMG! I miss it so much his eyes would light up and that beautiful smile!! <br>
Timmy was born and raised in South Lake Tahoe, where, this would be is decision to Rest In Peace.<br>
Timmy lived Life BIG!! He lived each day like there was no tomorrow!! And I am happy he did. <br>
We had so many BBQ's and parties here at the Smith Home!! I loved having all the kids here, even when I bitched about it!! Now I MISS it so much.<br>
Timmy joined the US Army April 28, 2004, he went to Boot Camp at Ft. Leonard Wood graduating on Aug. 12, 2004, the same day as his Nana's Birthday. The whole Family was there to Honor and Celebrate Timmy's new life.<br>
He would call me and say he had some R&R time and I would say give me the dates now and I would call my friend Marvis and book his flight.<br>
It always made me feel so good that he wanted to come home to spend it with his family and all his best friends.<br>
Sgt. Timothy Michael Smith was assigned to Alpha Company, Brigade Special Troops Battalion, 4th Brigade Combat Team, 10th Mountain Division, from Fort Polk Louisiana on Oct. 24, 2004. He deployed to Afghanistan in Support of Operation Enduring Freedom with Task Force Warrior from March 9, 2006 to November 21st 2006. He proudly served as a driver on his team while on numerous successful Missions.<br>
On November 27th 2007 he deployed with Alpha Co. Brigade Special Troops Battalion in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom where he was a Husky Operator for First Platoon. Smitty, his Army nickname, Valiantly led his company in IED and EFP finds.<br>
He Successfully led over 140 Missions, finding more IED's and EFP's than anyone in his Unit. Timmy was deployed the day before he was to be out of the Army, serving his time he signed up for, but his Unit was STOP LOSS for 18 month's.<br>
Timmy was a Protector, and a Proud and Strong Soldier, making Sgt. very quickly one month after arrival in Baghdad, Iraq in December 2007.<br>
He was a character and loved by all of his Army Family, as I have heard all the stories, When Timmy (Smitty) walked into a room, even if it was the worst day of your life, he could put a smile on your face and change the whole room into laughter and brighten it up.<br>
To know Timmy was to Love Timmy is what one of his best Army Brother's father said to me, as he had first met him and loved him like a son.<br>
Timmy loved life and lived it "BIG".<br>
On his last Mission Monday April 7, 2008 he had told his buddies, "Well this will be my last meal with you, while eating his favorite Army dersert Strawberry shortcake" some say they joked all the time about saying silly things like that but I believe my son knew it was not a joke. I love you and miss you my son so much.<br>
at 20:00 his Husky drove over a EFP after he had just gotten out before that and disarmed 2 IED's, he climbed back into his Husky Vehicle, they had heard it was a Hot Spot and were told to turn around and come back, but he drove forward.<br>
All of his Brother's in Arms circled around his vehicle, they got out of their vehicles and struggled to get him out of his one man vehicle, and rushing him back to the Medivac, shooting at anything that moved.... I know they worked hard to keep him alive... and they all thought he would be ok...I know all of his Brothers tried so hard to save my Son, and I love all of you, and my heart hurts for all of you, knowing it goes through your heads daily. But we have to remember the Happy Litlle Irish guy who loved life.. I Love you my Son and Miss you everyday.<br>
Love Mom FOREVER IN MY HEART.<br>

Alice Marie SMYTH
<p>
<a name ="I025599"><b>[I025599]</b></a><br />
I accidentally came across this item while looking for something else in the<br>
Amherst Daily News newspaper. As many of the Parrsboro Record's and the<br>
Springhill Records's from the 50's are missing on microfilm at NSARM,<br>
Halifax, (possibly due to the 1957 Springhill Fire) I have been re-reading<br>
the A.D.N. for the missing 50's time slots.<br>
<br>
Note Alice Marie Smythe is a sister to Phoebe Helen Smythe who m/1 George<br>
Washington Hudson, Emily Jane Winters' son on my research line. Isaac<br>
Luthern Phinney's mother was Annie Winters (haven't managed to make this<br>
connection to my research line yet); small world!<br>
<br>
I have noted the "typos, misprints & errors" below the obit. that "I'm aware<br>
of" as it was possibly written by one of the surviving children who didn't<br>
know all the early details.<br>
<br>
It is believed Alice and Isaac's marriage broke up sometime after 1915 and<br>
she then took Irene and Luther with her over to the Valley and m/2 Manson<br>
Porter sometime before 1920 and had 10 additional children.<br>
<br>
Isaac Luthern Phinney m/3 the widow, Annie Laura (Davis) Lewis on 1918 in<br>
Parrsboro, N.S.<br>

OBITUARY: Mrs. Alice M. Porter<br>
Kentville - Mrs. Alice Marie Porter, 59, of Lakeville, Kings County, widow<br>
of Mansor Porter, passed away at her home in that community early Saturday.<br>
While her health had not been good for several years, her sudden passing<br>
was unexpected. Born in Parrsboro, Mrs. Porter was the daughter of the late<br>
Mr. and Mrs. William Smythe. Following her marriage in 1913, she lived at<br>
Glenmont, where her husband was a well known farmer, and later resided at<br>
Marden, where Mr. Porter died in 1937. Mrs. Porter, until her health failed,<br>
was a prominent church worker in the Baptist Churches in communities where<br>
she had resised, and was also interested in other women's organizations and<br>
community work generally. Surviving are twelve children, five sons, Luther<br>
Porter, Berwick; Leonard, with the Black Watch Regiment, Aldershot Camp;<br>

<br>
Notes:<br>
1) "William" Smythe should be JAMES WILSON Smythe.<br>
<br>
2) Her marriage on 13 Oct 1913 was to Isaac Luthern Phinney, a widower with 3 sons, James E. Phinney and twins, Stewart Albert Phinney & Alfred D. Phinney (believe Alfred D. may have died young).<br>
<br>
3) "Luther "Porter" is Luther Smythe PHINNEY from m/1 to Isaac Luthern Phinney.<br>
<br>
4) "Irene" is Irene M. Phinney from m/1 to Isaac Luthern Phinney. Irene M. m/1 Harry Kempton Porter.<br>
<br>
5) There was no mention of surviving siblings as I believe all predeceased Alice before 1955.<br>
