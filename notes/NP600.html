Ichabod WRIGHT
<p>
<a name ="I011737"><b>[I011737]</b></a><br />
Died by drowning.<br>
---------------------------<br>
Ichabod, youngest son of Elijah, Sen., born August 24, 1776, removed to Park Hill, and occupied the house built by Josiah Phelps. He married Mary Clapp, daughter of Jonathan Clapp. He was a prominent member of the church, an active, working Christian, ever ready to stand in his lot and bear his part in the work of the church. Often the weekly neighborhood prayer meeting was held at his house, and when it was at the schoolhouse, or elsewhere, he was almost always present, ready, by prayer and exhortation, to contribute to the interest and profit of the occasion. These neighborhood gatherings for social prayer and conference were a source of great spiritual profit, to those who attended them, and through them to the whole district, as well as to the church. His death occurred in 1 844. His children were Horace, Ichabod Strong, Edmund, J. Rockwell, and Russell M. Horace owned and worked a tannery for a number of years, at Roberts Meadow, in Northampton; afterwards removed to Syracuse, N. Y., and now resides in St. Louis, Mo. I. Strong resides in Brooklyn. Edmund graduated at Williams College in 1836; studied theology at East Windsor, Ct.; was ordained minister of the gospel; labored as a home missionary for many years in Weston, Mo.; afterwards was pastor of a church in St. Louis, Mo, and has been Secretary of the Home Missionary Society in that State. He is a faithful laborer, and has been the means of great good to those for whom he has labored. J. Rockwell lived on the old homestead for many years, but finally sold it, and removed to South Hadley, where he now resides. Russell M. graduated at Williams College in 1841, and was one of the early and efficient teachers of Williston Seminary. He afterwards removed to Georgia, where he was employed as Principal of a female educational institution, located at Athens. On the breaking out of the war, he returned to his native place, and is now instructor in Natural Sciences in Williston Seminary. <br>

<p>
<a name ="I012315"><b>[I012315]</b></a><br />
The will of Ichabod Wright states that he had no children or descendants, only a wife and brothers. <br>
This begs the question as to his relationship to Edwin Wright. The will state that he was raise from infancy by Ichabod but was never legally adopted.<br>

John WRIGHT
<p>
<a name ="I012356"><b>[I012356]</b></a><br />
The Wrights of Kelvedon Hatch are fairly well know in gene- alogy circles as the Kelvedon Wrights. Records indicate the early family lived at Dagen- hams as Sir John Wright(1) was Christened there on 27 Oct 1450, as was his son John Wright(2) who was Christened on 12 Jul 1488, and died there on 5 Oct 1551. Olive Hubbard, the wife of John Wright(2) was also born at Dagenhams, and Christened there on 22 Feb 1487. The same records also indicate their marriage on 17 Mar 1509 at Dagenhams.<br>
<br>
However, before Kelvedon Manor was purchased, John Wright, although had been recorded as in Kelvedon Hatch, was considered as a yeoman of South Weald. From this we can gather that the family had moved into the South Weald area from Dagenhams, sometime after his marriage in 1509. As of this writing, we do know that John Wright and his wife Olive Hubbard were in the Kelvedon Hatch area by 1522. Their son, John [Myddle] Wright was born 19 Jun 1522, Kelvedon Hatch, as was John [young] Wright, 4 May 1524.<br>
<br>
The Kelvedon Manor was purchased in 1538, yet "The first Book of the Registers of St Peter" has "Johanis Wryght, son of Johanis of Wealdside, md. Alicia Wood, widow, 13 Sep 1541". This indicates that John and Olive Wright may have still lived at Wealside.<br>
<br>
The "Eldest" John Wright remained in Kelvedon Hatch, while "Myddle" John, although born in Kelvedon Hatch, lived near Wealdside in South Weald and is considered by most as John Wright of "Wright's Bridge" [when looking at the map, it looks as though it is in Havering]. "Young" John was considered as John Wright "of South Weld".<br>

From a letter by Louise Miller written about 1905:<br>
"I visited Aunt Mary a few weeks ago.  She lives alone in her house in Farmington.  She has not been able to rent this summer to suit her.  I think she will sell her property there when she gets a good chance.  The boys are both living in St Paul now.  Aunt Mary and I made them a visit of a few days.  Thad has a home just out of the city limits.  He is working for the Hoist & Derrick Co, a large works.  Gets from 75 to 80 dollars a month.  They have two girls.  Arthur rents.  He only moved to St Paul this summer.  Is working for the same company.  I dont think Arthur is very rugged.  He had an operration last summer for appendicites.  Was in the Hunter Hospital here two weeks. "<br>

The parish register of South Weald contains a baptismal notices for"Samuel, son of John Wright of the Bridge..." (meaning Wrightsbridge).This son was born either June 29th or June 30th (depending on how youread the nearly illegible Roman date script in the parish register) inthe year 1606<br>

"...Samuel, the early emigrant from London who was among the first of thesettlers at Springfield, and again of Northampton"<br>
<br>
Samuel was one of two first deacons at 1st Congregational at Springfield,part of the Winthrop Colony<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Among the first settlers of the Connecticut River Valley was DeaconSamuel Wright of Springfield, and subsequently of Northampton; a briefnotice of whom, and some of his descendants, is subjoined. That beautifulvalley of rich land was acquired from its savage occupants, by theEnglish settlers, through severe hardships, and many sanguinaryconflicts; and men less daring in adventure would scarcely haveundertaken its settlement; and men whose characteristics were of a lesspositive quality could not have succeeded. It is, therefore, but an actof duty, and a just tribute of affection to their memories, to rescue, ifpossible, their names from the perishing records of their time, and notonly to incorporate them with the annals of the present, but, as objectsof affectionate remembrance, inscribe them in our family memorials.<br>
Springfield was settled A.D. 1636; but the name of Samuel Wright firstappears in the town records Dec. 12, 1639, when he was a juryman. He wasa deacon of the first church at Springfield, and "he used to exhort thepeople and conduct the meetings on the sabbaths when there was nominister." He moved to Northampton, A.D. 1655, and was among the firstsettlers of that town, where he "died, Oct. 17, 1665, while sleeping inhis chair." He left property by will to his wife Margaret, and each ofhis children, except Helped. His widow Margaret "died A.D. 1681." DeaconWright appears to have been an intelligent and useful member of thechurch, and labored to promote its prosperity. He was, quite probably, aman of a very religious temperament, as he chiefly distinguished himselfin religious affairs.<br>
He was supposed to have been the son of Mr. Nathaniel Wright, of London,a merchant interest in the Winthrop Colony, (1630), who had descendedfrom John Wright, of Kelvedon.<br>
around 1625/1626 in England. Deacon Samuel was b. in England and D. Oct.17, 1665 in Northampton, Hampshire County, Massachusetts. Deacon SamuelWright was one of the first settlers of Springfield, Hampden County,Massachusetts and came to that place about 1636 in the company of WilliamPynchon, and others, from Eastern Massachusetts who were intent onsettling the area for its rich trade and fertile land. He removed up theConnecticut River to Northampton about 1656 or 1657. Deacon Samuel WrightSr. was a Puritan from England, who came to America, California.1636, andwas the ancestor of many of those in western Massachusetts. It is saidthat both his father's and grandfather's name was John, and that theylived at a place called Wrightsbridge, co. Essex, 40 miles East ofLondon. Upon first arriving in New England, he may have lived in sometown at the Bay, as did most of the early settlers, but soon removed toSpringfield with the Wm. Pynchon party. Springfield, originally called byits Indian name "Agawam," until 1640, was surrounded by tribes ofsavages. It was the only English settlement in Massachusetts west ofBoston and vicinity, and perhaps contained not over 10 or 15 familieswhen Deacon Samuel, and family, came and settled on what is now MainStreet, a little below where now stands the historic First Church. Thefirst record of his presence in the settlement comes in the first jurynote in the Agawam court records dated Nov. 14, 1639. This entry revealsthat he served on the Jury, hearing cases between John Woodcoke and JohnCable and between William Pynchon and Thomas Merricks. His fellow juristsincluded a number of the other original inhabitants of the town, HenrySmyth, Jehew Burr, Henry Gregory, John Searle and Samuell Hubbard. Here,also, in 1639, he is mentioned in the town records as having been calledupon as Deacon of what is one of the 1st churches organized in the statesto serve as minister to the flock, "exhorting the people until such timeas another could be got for the job". Dea. Samuel removed, in 1656, toNorthampton, where his son Samuel Jr. had preceeded him, and was one ofits selectmen that year. On Oct. 17, 1665, Deacon Samuel "died whilesleeping in his chair" according to a 1666 record of the event. DeaconSamuel Wright's Sr.'s parents are believed to be John Wright and MarthaCastell. John Wright, Esq. was an influential London barrister who servedas a clerk of the House of Commons, and who came to some note in 1612 dueto his authorizing signature being affixed to certain publications of theHouse of Commons that railed against fiscal and religious policies ofJames I. (See endnote below) If the connection to John Wright, Esq. istrue, then Dea. Samuel's paternal grandfather was Lord John Wright ofWrightsbridge, co., Essex, England, who was granted arms, June 6, 1590,by Elizabeth I, and was one of the Protestants in the House of Lords whosupported Elizabeth, and later James I, in their religious policies. TheDeacon's wife, Margaret was b. in E ngland and D. July 24, 1681 inNorthampton, Hampshire County, Massachusetts. Her parents are not knownfor sure. Deacon Samuel and Margaret had at least 8 children. They wereSamuel Jr. (m. Elizabeth Burt)), Margaret (m. #1 Thomas Bancroft; m. #2?Thomas Bliss?)), Hester (m. Samuel Marshfield)), Lydia (m. #1 LawrenceBliss; m. #2 John Norton; m. #3 John Lamb; m. #4 George Colton)), Mary(m. Jonathan Taylor)), James (m. Abigail Jess/Jese/Jesse)), Judah (m. #1Mercy "Mary" Burt; m. #2 Sarah Woodford)) and Helped (died in infancy)).(*Note-It is thought that Deacon Samuel and Margaret did not have adaughter Hannah but she may have been a niece. Because of the confusionmany researchers connected to her have Deacon Samuel Wright and Margaretas her parents.)(*Note- The Deacon's connection to this important EnglishPuritan family (Lord John Wright of Wrightsbridge co., Essex, England)has not been conclusively proven. However, it is currently a far betterproposal than previously speculated English parentage (eg. Nathaniel &Lydia (James) Wright, John Wright, Esq.'s younger brother)).<br>

Samuel WRIGHT
<p>
<a name ="I012642"><b>[I012642]</b></a><br />
Per a book written by Eunice Miena Barber:<br>
Samuel, son of Deacon Samuel & his wife Margaret Unknown, born about 1629; was one of the petitioners to the General Court for the First Settlement of Northfield, then known as Squakheag, 5/31/1671. He was a resident of Northampton, Mass., at this time. The first petition was refused & another one was sent the next spring signed by 23 men including Samuel Wright Senior. This petition was granted & he was one of the sixteen heads of families who took house-lots & settled there. His lot was on the west side of the street "which they or their heirs had in the second settlement".<br>
The Indians continued friendly until spring of 1675. Brookfield was destroyed in August of that Year. (King Philip's War). A squad of twenty soldiers was sent by Major Pynchon to garrison Northfield who were put under command of Sergeant Samuel Wright. A battle between Hatfield Indians & Captains _____ & Beers was fought in town of Whately August 25. Sept 1st the Indians fell upon Deerfield & Thursday, Sept 2d, on Northfield. It was the season of drying flax; & ignorant of what had happened the day before to their neighbors at Deerfield, the people of Northfield went about their work as usual on that morning. The soldiers & settlers appeared to have been scattered in the meadow & house-lots when the assault was made. According to Rev. Mr. Hubbard "some were killed in their homes, others as they were coming out of the meadows, the rest: men, women, & children fled to their fort, unable to rally out & repel the enemy. The savages kept around them, killed many of their cattle, destroyed their grain (wheat which was harvested & in the stook) burnt the houses that were outside the stockade & laid all waste. The number of whites officially reported as killed was eight & one was Sgt. Samuel Wright.<br>
After another attack by the Indians on 9/4 the Squakheag families having thus been driven from their new homes returned to their old homes in Hadley & Northampton.<br>
In the second settlement of Squakheag or Northfield in 1685 to 90, Samuel Wright's heirs were assigned 60 acres. The homestead of this Samuel Wright who went to Northampton with his father had continued in his line from 1657 until the compilation of the New England Historical & Genealogical Register in 1886.<br>
He married, 11/24/1653, Elizabeth, daughter of Henry Burt who was a companion of Deacon Samuel Wright in the settlement of Springfield. She survived him & married 2d, 9/26/1684, Nathaniel Dickinson of Hatfield.<br>
