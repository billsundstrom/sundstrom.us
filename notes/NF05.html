The nuptials of Mr. Morton L, Parker and Miss Alice B. Hawkes were solemnized last evening at 8 o'clock at the home of the bride's parents, Dr. and Mrs. D. B. Hawkes, at No. 310 North Water street. The officiating clergyman was Bev. W. H, Prestley, pastor of the First Presbyterian Church, and the attendants were Miss Sophie and Mr. H. W. Elwood. The ceremony was witnessed by a company of forty lends of the happy pair, who received earnest congratulations. The bride, who has long been a social favorite in this community, was very tastefully attired in becoming costume of India mull and lace, the ornaments being natural flowers. The brides- maid was similarly attired. The couple received a large collection of beautiful gifts. A choice collation was served party fashion, and between 10 and 11 o'clock Mr. Parker and bride departed for the depot, and left for the east on a six weeks' bridal tour. They will visit New York City and points in Ohio and Connecticut. They take with them the best wishes of a large circle of friends. Mr. Parker is the cutter at J. B. Race and has formed many acquaintances in the com- munity during his residence of two or three years in our midst.<br>
