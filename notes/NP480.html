William Presley SCHULER
<p>
<a name ="I071422"><b>[I071422]</b></a><br />
William Presley Schuler, better known to family and friends as Pres, was born October 15, 1925 in Stockton, California to Elizabeth and George F. Schuler II. He was proud of his fourth generation heritage as a native Stocktonian. He attended El Dorado Grammar School, Stockton High School, and Stockton College before being drafted into the Army. The time Pres spent in the 100th Infantry Division forever impacted his life and inspired his many travels to France. He returned from WWII and completed his education at the University of California Berkeley in Electrical Engineering. Here he met Carreclyde Tindell from Lodi, California. They married in 1951 and had two children, Mary Beth and Will. After graduation Pres went to work for General Electric, but quickly learned that he did not want to live outside of Stockton. He joined the family business, George F. Schuler and Son, which specialized in sheet metal work and plumbing. He was proud of the business legacy started by his great-grandfather in 1886, who sold tinware to the gold miners traveling through Stockton to the Mother Lode. Pres and his brother, Fred, grew the company to a large-scale commercial contracting business that included HVAC, plumbing, electrical and a fire sprinkler department in Stockton and Modesto. Pres and Fred oversaw such prominent projects as San Joaquin Delta College, St. Joseph's Hospital, Dameron Hospital, University of the Pacific, Stockton East Water District and Lawrence Livermore Labs. Pres was passionate about Geo F Schuler, Inc and worked until his retirement in 2005. Pres and Carreclyde were avid travelers and journeyed to Europe annually for decades to explore the continent and its history, as well as visit his WWII fox hole in Bitche, France. He attended his annual Army reunion for more than 30 years and maintained great friendships with his Army brothers. He also enjoyed his second home in Lake Tahoe and his next vacation venture that he designed on Lake Alta, in Alta, CA. He was a charter member of Marching and Chowder, Sons of Bitche and loved his daily coffee club at University of the Pacific. Pres was an avid tennis player and enjoyed his weekly matches with good friends. Presley was preceded in death by his beloved wife Carreclyde, his brother Fred Schuler, his sister, Mary Henderson and his son, Will. He is survived by his daughter Mary Schuler Clark of Portland, granddaughter Caroline Perkins (Jason), his grandsons Sam Clark and Joe Schuler and his great-grandson Wyatt Schuler. There will be a reception in his honor Saturday August 8 at 11:30 a.m. at O'Conner Woods West Hall, 3400 Wagner Heights Rd. Stockton, CA. Donations in his honor can be made to Haggin Museum of Stockton, CA. or the charity of your choice.<br>
