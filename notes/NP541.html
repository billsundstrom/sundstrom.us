Eva Marie Beck, age 82 years, of the Park Rapids/Nevis area, passed away Thursday, August 6, 2020 at the Essentia Health-St. Josephʼs Medical Center in Brainerd, MN. <br>
Eva Marie Beck was born November 2, 1937 in Rice County, Minnesota to Raymond and Clarabelle Thielbar.  She attended school in Faribault, Minnesota until her senior year where she graduated from Mound, Minnesota.  Eva graduated from Robinson Cosmetology School in Minneapolis, followed by working in Excelsior.  In 1958 she moved to Los Angeles to work, where she met and married her husband Carl.  In 1959 they moved to Canoga Park, California, and raised daughter Carla and son Karl.  In 1972 the family moved to northern Minnesota and owned what is now known as the Osage Bait and Tackle. Originally a truck stop/restaurant, later bait and laundromat, Eva was recognized by many in the area as hardworking and honest.  After 27 years, they retired to Como Street in Park Rapids where they continued to enjoy the family, fishing, and singing karaoke in the local establishments and celebrated 55 years together.<br>
While in California, Eva took a cake decorating class, enjoying for many years making many cakes for family and friends.  She was a Blue Bird and a Boy Scout leader when the children were young.  In her youth, she was an exceptional ice-skater and roller-skater.<br>
Eva was an avid fisherman and made it her mission to teach her grand and great-grandchildren how to catch fish.  Eva loved to dance and considered the cha-cha her favorite.  In her retirement years, she discovered gardening, and flowers; saving seeds from "cosmal" flowers for the next year.  In the later years with Carl, camping-fishing trips became popular for them.        <br>
Eva had a strong belief in Scripture and what it said.  She believed the Bible "had all the answers to a happy life".  She believed once you died, youʼd sleep till Jesus Christ comes back.  Her favorite verses were Romans 10:9-10.<br>
In her later years, Eva found her soul mate, Bob Schmitt.  They spent many winters in his motor home parked in Big River, California.  Together they enjoyed singing karaoke, playing with the cat, and meeting new people.  Summers were spent in the Nevis and Park Rapids area, reacquainting with friends and family.          <br>
Eva is survived by her daughter, Carla Messmann of Hot Springs Village, Arkansas; son, Karl (Louise) Beck of Park Rapids, MN; grandchildren, Karl (Andrea) Beck Jr. of LaPorte, MN, Lee Anna (Ryan) Christensen of Florida, Hunter and Skyler Messmann of Hot Springs Village, Arkansas; great-grandchildren: Desmond, Lilyan, Ronan, William, and Grace; one sister, Doris (Dan) Mitchell of Park Rapids, MN; as well as several nieces and nephews.<br>

Alfred Delvan THOMAS
<p>
<a name ="I072096"><b>[I072096]</b></a><br />
Alfred Delavan Thomas was the first white child born in the town of Delavan, WI, which also gave him his middle name. He was more accurately born in Darien Township, one of the 4 townships which comprised the Town of Delavan. His birth year may have been 1838 rather than 1837, per obituary articles, but was more likely 1837 which is published in multiple sources. The Thomas family bible was "corrected" to 1837 from 1836 - and the birth date of the 11th was filled in later.<br>
Alfred Delavan Thomas was an attorney. A September, 1861 graduate of Brown University, Providence, RI, he read law with his future father-in-law, Judge A.H. Barnes, in Delavan, WI. He later completed his studies with Butler & Cottrill, Milwaukee, WI. He practiced law in Wisconsin after graduation; he was district attorney in the Delavan, WI area for 6 years shortly after his graduation and is mentioned in the "History of Walworth Co, WI" as practicing law in Delavan in 1863. In June of 1863, he registered for the Civil War draft as Alfred D. Thomas, age 253, unmarried, lawyer, b. WI, of the 1st district, Delavan, Walworth Co., WI.<br>
His name appears in the "Delavan Republican" newspaper of 11 June 1868 in the following article; "There will be a meeting of all those who are interested in the game of Base Ball, at A. D. Thomas' office, on Saturday evening, June 18th, at 8 o'clock. A full attendance is requested." So Alfred was, it appears, interested in sports!<br>
In his father-in-law's 1887 obituary, Alfred is mentioned as "Col." A.D. Thomas - could he have served in the military? There is no indication of it in any account and may have been, perhaps, an honorary title.<br>
In 1873 Alfred went to Black Hills, SD where he was attorney for Homestake Mining for 5 years; he also had a law practice in Fargo, ND called Benton & Thomas. It appears that he may have gone to North Dakota somewhat earlier than 1873 as his son reports in the 1900 census being born in North Dakota in May, 1868. Alfred moved to Fargo permanently in 1883, later being appointed the first U.S. District Judge of North Dakota by President Benjamin Harrison on 25 Feb. 1890. We have record of his signed oath 13 March 1890 taken at the District Court of the U.S., District of Minnesota. That position took him to St. Paul, Topeka, Little Rock, Kansas City, Fargo and elsewhere. <br>
In 1883 he & Fanny lived at Oak and Broadway, Fargo. In 1891 they lived at 114 8th St. N., Fargo. In 1893 and 1895-6 they lived at 409 8th St. S.; he died while living there in 1896 and Fanny remained until her death in 1898.<br>
At his death in 1896, A.D. Thomas was buried in Delavan, WI (from Thomas family bible). Cause of death was reported as exhaustion due to general toxemia in one newspaper; another reported that he'd suffered from neuralgia of the head and that he'd recently returned from New York where he'd been treated for "nervous trouble." He was buried 10 August 1896 in the Spring Grove Cemetery, Delavan, WI in block 25, lot 1, section 0.<br>
He appears to be the "Thomas" referred to in several of the letters from Herbert Barnes to his sister Fannie (who later married Thomas). In a 5 Oct. 1862 letter, he says "Thomas leaves for troy (?) tomorrow morning to peddle whips. I hope he will soon be through with his job for I shall be lonesome without him." Herbert later mentions that he and Thomas had set up an office together and that Thomas had given up the "whip speculation" and was reading law. [See Notes: Herbert H. Barnes for detailed description of the letters.]<br>
At the time of A.D.'s death, his son Alfred Bennett Thomas was living in St. Paul or Duluth (newspaper accounts differ, though it's likely to have been Duluth, the location of his daughter's birth 16 June 1897, less than a year later). Daughter Clara Lucia (Lulu) Thomas Wear had been married about 7 years and was living in Fargo, ND as was Gertrude Thomas who was 26 years old; she married Chauncey Eugene Wheeler the December following her father's death.<br>
Most of the career information above comes from 2 obituaries: one with no date from the newspaper the "Dispatch", possibly Fargo, ND; the other from the Fargo "Argus" August 9, 1896.<br>
Albert D. Thomas appears to have acquired the family bible from his mother and father. Whether this occurred because he was the eldest son or perhaps because he was the sole surviving son, we don't know; information on son Fred L. Thomas, other than birth date & place of death & burial, is scant and it appears that he never married, having died at about age 36. The pages removed from that bible have come to Robert Thomas Wheeler via his father, Chauncey Thomas, and his grandmother, Gertrude Thomas Wheeler, daughter of Fannie.<br>

Judge Alfred Delavan Thomas, deceased. That which records in perpetuity the names and the memory of great men, and secures to history the deeds that shape the course and policy of a state or nation, is a treasure valued by all who stand for purity and high attainments in the public service. A life history of the late Judge Thomas will add luster to the brightest pages of the annals of the Dakotas, where the last twenty-three years of his life were spent, Fargo being his home from 1878 Up to the time of his death, in 1896.<br>
Judge Thomas was born in Walworth County, Wisconsin, August 11, 1837, His parents were Salmon and Elizabeth (Stowell) Thomas, both native of New York, and his grandfather, George Thomas, was born in Connecticut. Judge Thomas had two sisters and one brother - the two sisters are now living. In New York Salmon Thomas was a large landowner, and in 1833 removed to Walworth County, Wisconsin, where his integrity and personal worth soon brought him into prominence. He served in the legislature of that state in 1847 and 1848, and was recognized as one of the leading public men of the state. He died in Walworth County September 27, 1887, and his wife died June 27, 1896.<br>
Alfred D. Thomas grew to manhood in his native state, and received an unusually good primary education. He graduated from the Brown University, Providence, Rhode Island, in the class of 1801, and was soon after elected district attorney of his home county of Walworth, Wisconsin, serving for six years.. He began the study of law with the Hon. Alanson H. Barnes, of Delavan, Wisconsin, and finished his preliminary studies in the office of Butler & Cottrell, of Milwaukee. He devoted his entire attention to his profession as a lawyer, and being a great student, he continued after his graduations to pursue a course of self-education, and thus to equip his mind with these powers which afterward asserted themselves so effectively in the high duties he was called upon to discharge.<br>
In February, 1877, Judge Thomas visited Dakota, intending to locate at Fargo, but accompanying Judge Barnes and other friends to the Black Hills, he there met Senator Hearst, who formed so favorable an impression of his acquirements and natural gifts that he offered him the position of regular attorney for the Homestake and other mining companies of California in which the Senator was interested. In this capacity he was associated with, or pitted against, such men as Colonel Harry Thornton, of San Francisco; Judge W. H. Clagett, of Idaho: Judge William Fullerton, of New York; Judge William C. Kingsley, of Denver, and Judge Bennett, of Salt Lake City, and during the live years of his professional services to these companies he proved himself at least the peer of these brilliant lights of the profession in the west. In 1883 he returned to Fargo and entered the practice of his profession there, but his fame as a lawyer and a man of integrity had reached far beyond the borders of his state, and in 1889 President Harrison appointed him United States district judge for the district of North Dakota. His known ability and peculiar fitness to deal with the judicial questions and conditions of the west added greatly to his labors, and he was called to preside in the federal courts at St. Paul, Topeka, Kansas City, Little Rock, Denver and various other points. His zeal for the service of his country was only equaled by his capacity to perform the duties of his high station.<br>
Judge Thomas was a man of a genial nature, and his popularity was not a matter of wonder. His warm-hearted manner, combined with high attainments and force of character, won him friends and admirers wherever he went. While performing the stern duties of a federal judge, he was still a man of genuine sympathy, and while upholding the solemn dignity of the law, mercy was ever made a substitute for severity where the latter quality was not absolutely essential in the administration of justice. In his private life none could be purer, more sympathetic, more lovable; and in his face were registered the kindly, generous thoughts that sprang from the heart of a noble man. This narrative is for all to read, but in its lines, as in the features of his sympathetic face, only those of the little circle encompassed by his best love can read the inexpressible depths and truths of his life story. His death occurred August 8, 1896, within three days of his fifty-ninth birthday, surrounded by his family and friends, at his home in Fargo. His remains were taken back to his old home, Delavan, Wisconsin, where they rest in Spring Grove cemetery.<br>
Judge Thomas' domestic life was a particularly happy one. He was married to Miss Fannie E. Barnes, daughter of A. H. Barnes, who was for eight years associate judge of the territory of Dakota. The marriage ceremony took place at Delavan, Wisconsin, in October, 1864. Mrs. Thomas died November 5, 1898 in Fargo, where their two daughters, Mrs. Lulu Thomas Wear and Mrs. Dr. C. E. Wheeler, reside. Their only son, Alfred B., Thomas, is a resident of Duluth, Minnesota.<br>
