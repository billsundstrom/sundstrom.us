St. Louis Post-Dispatch, 6 February 2005<br>
-------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
John W. Bennett , an internationally renowned social anthropologist and a founder of Washington University's Department of Anthropology, died Tuesday (Feb. 1, 2005) at Sunrise Senior Living in Richmond Heights. He was 89 and had lived in University City. <br>
Professor Bennett joined the university as a sociology professor more than 40 years ago. In 1967, he was part of a group of faculty that formed the Department of Anthropology in Arts & Sciences. He was appointed chairman of the department in its first year and served two terms. <br>
Professor Bennett was also affiliated with the university's East Asian Center and its Technology and Human Affairs Program. <br>
Professor Bennett became a distinguished anthropologist in residence at Washington University in 1987, easing back his teaching schedule to devote more time to research. His research reflected a career that spanned fields including archaeology, sociology, East Asian studies, government, academic services, ecology and agrarian development. <br>
Much of his work centered on ways people could avoid abusing the environment and wasting natural resources, while still using the land for agriculture and rural development. He had a particular interest in regions such as Israel and western India. His most recent work was a study of agricultural and social development in a semi-arid region of the northern Great Plains, located in Saskatchewan. <br>
Professor Bennett also published articles on environmental pollution in Japan, including his work on the development of modern Japanese society. Earlier in his career, he had led a team of anthropologists in a study of Japanese society during the post-World War II occupation. <br>
He wrote books and articles that earned honors including the 1989 American Anthropology Association Award for Distinguished Service and the 2004 Society for Applied Anthropology Bronislaw Malinowski Award. <br>
His papers and photographic work are housed in the Rare Books and Manuscripts Library of Ohio State University. <br>
A native of Milwaukee, Professor Bennett graduated with a bachelor of science degree from Beloit College in Wisconsin. He earned a doctorate in anthropology from the University of Chicago in 1946. <br>
Services will be private. <br>
Among the survivors are two sons, John M. Bennett of Columbus, Ohio, and James P. Bennett of Madison, Wis.; and five grandchildren. <br>
