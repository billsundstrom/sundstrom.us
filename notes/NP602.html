IN LOVING MEMORY OF Wayne N. Yeadon March 18, 1954 - September 17, 2008. We never got to say goodbye and then you were gone. We never thought that you being the man that could fly planes, rebuild a sports car, become an accomplished diver and marksman, could be taken from your family in such a tragic and sudden way. Our only joy is knowing that, although we will not meet again here, we will meet in a much better place in heaven where God will make sense of this all. We love you. Harold, Christine and Eric<br>
