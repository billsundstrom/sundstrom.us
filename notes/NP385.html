Dillard Munford was former chairman of Munford Inc., a convenience store chain that operated 600 Majik Market stores at the time it was sold in 1988. <br>
In 1964, Mr. Munford was the first in Atlanta to sell food and gasoline at roadside markets, according to an article in The Atlanta Journal. He started building a vast retail business in 1946 when he formed Confederate Rock Wool Co. to sell insulation material. The company added overstock items to its inventory, and expanded as a chain of Munford Do-It-Yourself stores. <br>
In 1962, the company merged with Atlantic Ice and Coal and 127 E-Z Market convenience stores. Munford served as president and CEO of the combined company. He acquired World Bazaar import stores, LeeWard Creative Crafts stores, Majik Markets and Minit Markets, and changed the name of the company to Munford Inc. <br>

Dillard Munford, the wealthy founder of a chain of convenience stores, died on Wednesday at Emory University Hospital in Atlanta. He was 75.<br>

His interests were wide-ranging. Until his term ended in April, he was a trustee of the Freedom Forum and its predecessor organization, the Gannett Foundation. The forum is a nonprofit organization that promotes journalism education, assists minority journalism students and conducts international internship programs.<br>
Mr. Munford was born in Cartersville, Ga. He graduated from the Georgia Institute of Technology with a degree in mechanical engineering.<br>
He founded the Munford Company to manufacture rock wool insulation, primarily for Sears, Roebuck & Company, and then ventured into retailing. The first Munford Do-It-Yourself store opened in 1952; 10 years later the chain merged with Atlantic Company. Acquisitions and mergers led to further expansion into a chain of 46 stores.<br>
