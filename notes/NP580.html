In a booklet written for the 1953 Centennial of Edgerton, there is a story told involving John Varnum. In an area near what is now Edgerton, Wisconsin, in 1844, William Bliven arrived with his family to settle his 80 acres. There was concern that claim jumpers would get ahead of him and steal his land. "The government surveyors had erected a slight mound of dirt at the corners of sections and set it in a square stake on which was burned or cut a set of numbers to denote the description of that piece of land. Unearthing his hidden pouch of gold coins, the glittering coins were spread on the table and $100 counted as the purchase price of the eighty acres of land at $1.25 an acre. The Land Office was to be opened on the second following day at Milwaukee and an eager rush would ensue from the entire southern part of the Territory of Wisconsin. Varnum Wescott, a neighbor, was reputed to be a fast traveler, and was given the money and the description of the land and started on foot at nightfall, guided by the stars. He walked the two nights and a day to arrive at the Land Office about sunup and formally made a 'settling down' of the land of the northwest quarter of Section 3 Town 4 North of Range 12 East to Bleven and his heirs."<br>
Varnum had settled his land near by in 1844. His birth date here taken from cemetery records.<br>

Benjamin Galt WESTOVER
<p>
<a name ="I065006"><b>[I065006]</b></a><br />
Obituary as Read by Rev. T. E. Ream, at the Funeral for Benjamin Westover: The deceased, Mr. Benjamin G. Westover, was born at Sheffield, Berkshire County, Mass, on the 29th day of March, 1816, and died at the home of his daughter, Mrs. Ella Gleason, of Genoa, Ill., Thursday morning, February 22, 1906. Mr. Westover lived to the good old age of nearly ninety years. Had he lived until the 29th of March 1906, he would have been 90 years of age. When a small boy he moved from Massachusetts with his parents and settled in New York State. In the year of 1848 he moved from New York and settled in Illinois, first making his home near Aurora, in Kane County. He was a resident of Kane County for about 22 years. While living in Kane County he was united in marriage to Bertha Perry at Clinton, Ill, on the first day of January, 1852. In the year of 1870 he moved from Kane County to Genoa, De Kalb County, where he has resided for the past thirty-six years of his life.Mr. Westover was one of a family of seven children and the last surviving member of his father's family. Of his own immediate family he leaves to mourn his departure four children, two sons and two daughters. His sons are: Ira Westover of Brooten, Minn., Fred Westover of Swaledale, Iowa. His daughters are: Mrs. Ella Gleason of Genoa, Ill., and Mrs. Sarah E. Richardson of Dane, Wis., all of whom naturally feel the sorrow of mourning for a father who had long been kind and devoted to them. He also leaves 22 grandchildren and several nephews and nieces who sorrow with the members of the immediate family.Mr. Westover was a man who usually enjoyed most excellent health, and even in his death he revealed no signs of pain or suffering. He is regarded as one of Genoa's oldest citizens, and because of his extreme old age he was not prominent in the minds of the young, rising generations, but he had many very sincere friends among those who knew him best. He was a good and kind neighbor, genial in manner and conversation, kind hearted, always ready to help anyone in time of trouble when it was in his power to do so. He seemed to feel that he would not live much longer and a few months before his death expressed the opinion that he would not see another birthday.In his long life of many years, it was his lot to pass through the many hardships, incident to all early settlers. He was a hard working man, honest and honorable, and God saw fit to give him many years of life. In his death a long life has closed, and the words of the patriarch come to us as the most appropriate: "Thou shalt come to thy grave in full age, like as a shock of corn cometh in his season."The funeral services were held on Saturday afternoon at two o'clock. Rev. T. E. Ream officiated and preached on the theme "Old Age", taking his scripture text to words "Thou shalt go to they Father's in peace, thou shalt be buried in good old age."<br>
