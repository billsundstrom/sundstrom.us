CRISMIER, DR. CHARLES, JR. "CRIS" Age 92, born April 5, 1914, in Newark, NJ; promoted to glory February 22, 2007, in Riverside, CA. <br>
Answering God's call while in his late teens, Cris fulfilled his life verse of John 15:16 by faithfully and continuously serving the Lord in Christian ministry for 72 years; the word "retirement" was not in his vocabulary. He began his ministry as a Salvation Army officer and continued in church pastorates from coast to coast, as well as in evangelism and international missionary work. He was an alumnus of Nazarene Theological Seminary and Azusa Pacific University, earning his doctorate from the California Graduate School of Theology at the age of 66. A voracious reader, Cris prized his library of thousands of volumes relating to theology and the Christian life. A 20-year resident of Riverside, Cris served as chaplain at Kaiser Permanente Hospital for 14 years, followed by three years as pastoral care associate at Arlington Avenue Church of the Nazarene until his death. During these years, he also taught Sunday School, led midweek Bible studies, developed a hospice chaplaincy program, and often preached at area churches as well as the Air Force Village chapel in Riverside. In all of these endeavors, he mentored and impacted many for Christ. In the pattern of I Corinthians 15:58, he was ". . . steadfast, unmoveable, always abounding in the work of the Lord." <br>
Preceded in death by and now rejoicing in heaven with his beloved daughter, Karin Crismier Padilla, Cris is survived by his wife of 64 years, Gladys Rylander Crismier; son Chuck (Kathie) Crismier; son Ken Crismier; daughter-in-law Rose Crismier; son-in-law Ray Padilla; son Bob (Candy) Crismier; and daughter Carolyne (Stephen) Nielson.
