<h2>Notes</h2>
Humphrey III DE BOHUN
<p>
<a name ="I015134"><b>[I015134]</b></a><br />
Humphrey (d. 1182) was sometimes called Earl of Hereford after the failure of the male line in his mother's family, but was never formally installed as earl. He married Margaret, daughter of Henry, Earl of Huntingdon (who was a son of David, King of Scotland). Since he died before his father, the family lands were inherited by his son Henry de Bohun, 1st Earl of Hereford. Henry was succeeded by his son<br>
<br>
According to the chronicle of Lanthony, Humphrey IV was earl of Hereford and constable of England. But he died before his father, probably in 1182 in France while serving Henry the younger, so he never had the titles.<br>
Humphrey was married to Margaret of Scotland. After Humphrey's death, his widow confirme d the gift of a marketplace to the priory of Brandenstoke that he had specified in his will .<br>
</p>
Eustace II DE BOULOGNE
<p>
<a name ="I008051"><b>[I008051]</b></a><br />
Eustace II, (d. 1093), count of Boulogne, was the husband of Goda, daughter of the English king Æthelred the Unready, and sister of Edward the Confessor. He was the son of Eustace I. From his second marriage with Ida of Lorraine, Eustace had two sons, Godfrey of Bouillon and Baldwin, later monarchs of Jerusalem in Syria.<br>
<br>
Eustace paid a visit to England in 1051, and was honourably received at the Confessor's court. A brawl in which he and his servants became involved with the citizens of Dover led to a serious quarrel between the king and Earl Godwine.<br>
<br>
The latter, to whose jurisdiction the men of Dover were subject, refused to punish them. His lack of respect to those in authority was made the excuse for outlawing himself and his family. In 1066 Eustace came to England with Duke William, and fought at the battle of Hastings.<br>
<br>
In the following year, probably because he was dissatisfied with his share of the spoil, he assisted the Kentishmen in an attempt to seize Dover Castle. The conspiracy failed, and Eustace was sentenced to forfeit his English fiefs.<br>
<br>
Subsequently he was reconciled to the Conqueror, who restored a portion of the confiscated lands.<br>
<br>
Eustace died in 1093, and was succeeded by his son, Eustace III.<br>
</p>
Eustace III DE BOULOGNE
<p>
<a name ="I008050"><b>[I008050]</b></a><br />
Eustace III, was a count of Boulogne, successor to his father Count Eustace II of Boulogne. It remains somewhat unclear whether he was also a son of Ida of Lorraine, who certainly was the mother of his two younger brothers.<br>
<br>
He went on crusade in 1096 with his brothers Godfrey of Bouillon (duke of Lower Lorraine) and Baldwin of Boulogne. He soon returned to Europe to administer his domains. He married Princess Mary of Scotland, daughter of King Malcolm III of Scotland, and Saint Margaret of Scotland. Eustace and Mary had one daughter, Matilda of Boulogne.<br>
<br>
When his youngest brother king Baldwin I of Jerusalem died in 1118, the elderly Eustace was offered the throne. Eustace was at first uninterested, but was convinced to accept it; he travelled all the way to Apulia before learning that a distant relative, Baldwin of Bourcq, had been crowned in the meantime. Eustace returned to Boulogne and died about 1125.<br>
<br>
On his death the county of Boulogne was inherited by his daughter, Matilda, and her husband Stephen de Blois, count of Mortain, afterwards king of England, and at the death of Matilda in 1151 it was inherited by their son, Eustace IV of Boulogne, later their second son William and ultimately by their daughter Marie of Boulogne, since both sons died without children.<br>
</p>
Marie DE BOULOGNE
<p>
<a name ="I007543"><b>[I007543]</b></a><br />
Marie of Boulogne was the Countess of Boulogne from 1159 to 1170.<br>
<br>
Marie was born to King Stephen of England and his wife Matilda I, Countess of Boulogne. She was placed in a convent but was taken out to marry Matthew of Alsace, who would later become Count of Boulogne through his marriage to her.<br>
<br>
In 1159, when her childless brother died, she succeeded the County. Her husband became co-ruler in 1160. They reigned together until their divorce in 1170, when Matthew (not Marie) continued to reign until his death in 1173, when their daughter Ida became the Countess.<br>
<br>
Marie died in 1180/82. Her sister Mathilde inherited Marie's land and possessions in England, rather than Ida.<br>
</p>
Clotilde DE BOURGOGNE
<p>
<a name ="I010070"><b>[I010070]</b></a><br />
From Wikipedia<br>
<br>
Saint Clotilde (475 - 545 in Tours), also spelled as Clotilda, Clotild, Clothilde, or Chlothilde, was the daughter of Burgundian king Chilperic. Her uncle was the Burgundian king and Roman general Gundobad. Clotilde was the wife of Clovis I and contributed to her husband's conversion to Catholic christianity.<br>
<br>
On the death of Gundioc, king of the Burgundians, in 473, his sons Gundobad, Godegesil and Chilperic divided his heritage between them; Chilperic apparently reigning at Lyons, Gundobald at Vienne and Godegesil at Geneva.<br>
<br>
According to Gregory of Tours, Chilperic was slain by Gundobad, his wife drowned, and of his two daughters, Chrona took the veil and Clotilde was exiled. This account, however, seems to have been a later invention, since an epitaph discovered at Lyons speaks of a Burgundian queen who died in 506. This was most probably the mother of Clotilde.<br>
<br>
In 493 Clotilde married Clovis, King of the Franks, who had just conquered northern Gaul. She was brought up in the Catholic faith and did not rest until her husband had abjured paganism and embraced the Catholic faith in 496. With him she built at Paris the church of the Holy Apostles, afterwards known as Sainte Geneviève. After the death of Clovis in 511 she retired to the abbey of St Martin at Tours.<br>
<br>
In 523 she incited her sons against her cousin Sigismund, the son of Gundobad and provoked the Burgundian war. In the following year she tried in vain to protect the rights of her grandsons, the children of Clodomer, against the claims of her sons Childebert I and Clotaire I, and was equally unsuccessful in her efforts to prevent the civil discords between her children. She died in 544 or 545, and was buried at her husband's side in the church of the Holy Apostles.<br>

He became Duke of Burgundy following the abdication of his older brother, Hugh I, who retired to become a Benedictine monk. Eudes married Maud of Burgundy (1065 - 1101), daughter of William I, Count of Burgundy and Stephanie de Longwy. He was a participant in the ill-fated Crusade of 1101.<br>
</p>

<p>
<a name ="I005052"><b>[I005052]</b></a><br />
Henry of Burgundy (1035 - ca.1074) was the son and heir of Robert I, duke of Burgundy. He died shortly before his father and failed to succeed in Burgundy. He married Sibylle of Barcelona (ca. 1035- July 6, 1074), daughter of Berenger Ramon I of Barcelona, and their children were:<br>

</p>
Hugh II DE BOURGOGNE
<p>
<a name ="I015276"><b>[I015276]</b></a><br />
Hugh II of Burgundy (1084-1143) was duke of Burgundy between 1103 and 1143. Hugh was son of Eudes I, Duke of Burgundy. He married about 1115 to Felicia-Matilda of Mayenne, the daughter of Gauthier, Count of Mayenne, and Aelina de Presles. He was succeeded by the eldest of his six sons.<br>

</p>
Hugh III DE BOURGOGNE
<p>
<a name ="I015280"><b>[I015280]</b></a><br />
Hugh III of Burgundy (1142-August 25, 1192, in Acre) was duke of Burgundy between 1162 and 1192. Hugh was the eldest son of duke Eudes II and Marie of Blois. He was married twice, first to Beatrice d'Albon, then to Alice of Lorraine (daughter of duke Matthias I), and had several sons and daughters.<br>
<br>
The rule of Hugh III marked the ending of a period of relative peace in the duchy of Burgundy. Hugh was a belligerent man and soon was involved in conflicts against king Louis VII of France over their borders. When Philip Augustus succeeded Louis in 1180, Hugh seized the opportunity and forced several men to change alliance to Burgundy. Philip II was not happy with the loss of his vassals and invaded the duchy, besieging Chatillon. The town fell and with it, its garrison, commanded by Eudes, Hugh's heir. A peace was negotiated and Hugh had to pay a high ransom for his son and give up ambitions over French territory.<br>
<br>
Hugh then turned his energies to the Holy Land, embarking in the Third Crusade in the retinue of Philip II. He was the most trusted ally of Richard, the Lionheart and fought with him against Saladin. When Philip returned to France, he left Hugh in charge of the French troops. Hugh played a major role in the victory of the battle of Arsuf (September 7, 1191) and the conquer of Acre, where he died in the following year.<br>
<br>
In 1187, Hugh transferred the capital of Burgundy to Dijon, and endeavoured to turn the city into a major commercial centre.<br>
</p>
Robert I Capet DE BOURGOGNE
<p>
<a name ="I004850"><b>[I004850]</b></a><br />
Robert I Capet (1011-March 21, 1076) was duke of Burgundy between 1032 to his death. Robert was son of King Robert II of France and brother of Henry I. In 1031, after the death of his father the king, Robert participated in a rebellion against his brother Henry. He was supported by his mother, Queen Constance d'Arles. Peace was achieved when Robert was given Burgundy.<br>
<br>
    * He married his first wife, Helie of Semur, about 1033, and repudiated her in 1055, in which year he also murdered her father, Dalmace I of Semur. Robert and Helie had five children:<br>
   1. Hugh (1034-1059), killed in battle<br>
   2. Henry (1035-ca.1074)<br>

<br>
    * From his second wife, Ermengarde of Anjou, daughter of Fulk III of Anjou, he had one daughter:<br>
   1. Hildegard (c.1056-1104), married Duke William VIII of Aquitaine<br>
</p>
Rudolph I DE BOURGONE
<p>
<a name ="I005424"><b>[I005424]</b></a><br />
Rudolph I, born 859, died October 25, 912, King of (Upper or Transjurane) Burgundy from his election in 888 until his death.<br>
<br>
Rudolph belonged to the Welf family and was the son of Conrad, count of Auxerre, from whom he inherited the lay abbacy of St Maurice en Valais, making him the most powerful magnate in Upper Burgundy - present-day western Switzerland and the Franche Comté.<br>
<br>
After the deposition and death of Charles the Fat, the nobles and leading clergy of Upper Burgundy met at St Maurice and elected Rudolph as king. Apparently on the basis of this election, Rudolph claimed the whole of Lotharingia, taking much of modern Lorraine and Alsace - but his claim was contested by Arnulf of Carinthia, the new king of East Francia or Germany, who rapidly forced Rudolph to abandon Lotharingia in return for recognition as king of Burgundy. However, hostilities between Rudolph and Arnulf seem to have continued intermittently until 894.<br>
<br>
Rudolph's relationships with his other neighbours were friendlier. His sister Adelaide married Richard the Justiciar, duke of Burgundy (the present day Burgundy, part of west Francia), and his daughter, another Adelaide, married Louis the Blind of Provence (Lower Burgundy).<br>
<br>
Rudolph was succeeded as king of Burgundy by his son, Rudolph II.<br>
</p>
Rudolph II DE BOURGONE
<p>
<a name ="I005426"><b>[I005426]</b></a><br />
Rudolf II (died July 11, 937) King of Upper Burgundy (912-937), King of Lower Burgundy (Provence) (933-937), King of Italy (effective, 922-926 - claim abandoned 933). He was the son of Rudolf I, king of Upper Burgundy.<br>
<br>
Following his ascension to the throne in 912, Rudolf was asked by several Italian nobles to intervene in Italy on their behalf against Emperor Berengar in 922. Having entering Italy, he was crowned King of the Lombards at Pavia. In 923, he defeated Berengar at Piacenza; Berengar was murdered the following year, possibly at the instigation of Rudolf. The king then ruled Upper Burgundy and Italy together, residing alternately in both kingdoms. However, in 926 the Italian nobility turned against him and requested that Hugh of Arles, the effective ruler of Provence (or Lower Burgundy), rule them instead. Rudolf returned to Upper Burgundy to protect himself, assuring Hugh's coronation as King of Italy in the process. The Italians then switched sides again, declaring that they wished for Rudolf to reclaim the throne. To prevent this, Hugh and Rudolf signed a treaty in 933, granting Rudolf rule of Lower Burgundy in exchange for his renunciation of all claims on the Italian throne. The two Burgundian kingdoms unified, Rudolf ruled until his death in 937. He was succeeded by Conrad.<br>
</p>
Henri I DE BRABANT
<p>
<a name ="I007538"><b>[I007538]</b></a><br />
Henry I of Brabant (also called Henri I de Brabant and Hendrik I van Brabant) was born in 1165 and died in the German city of Köln on September 5, 1235. He was Duke of Brabant (1190-1235) and Duke of Lorraine. He was the son of Godfrey III duke of Lorraine and count of Brabant and Margaret of Limburg.<br>
<br>
He married Maud of Boulogne and Alsace (also called Maud of Flanders) in 1179.<br>
<br>
Henri II de Brabant was born from his first marriage.<br>
<br>
His second marriage was at April 22, 1213 in Soissons to Marie, princess of France, daughter of King Philip II of France.<br>
<br>
Under Hendrik I, there was a town policy and town planning. Hendrik's attention went out to those regions that lent themselves for extension of his sovereignty and in some locations he used the creation of a new town as an instrument in the political organisation of the area. Among the towns to which the Duke gave city rights and trade privileges was 's-Hertogenbosch.<br>
<br>
He was buried in St. Pieters cathedral at Leuven.<br>
</p>

</p>
Henri III DE BRABANT
<p>

<br>
The disputed territory of the former duchy of Lower Lorraine was assigned to him by the German King Alfonso IX of Castile.<br>
<br>
His daughter Maria of Brabant married king Philip III of France.<br>
</p>
Marie DE BRABANT
<p>
<a name ="I007558"><b>[I007558]</b></a><br />
Maria of Brabant, queen of France, was the daughter of Henry III, Duke of Brabant and became the second wife of Philip III of France in 1274. She was the mother of Louis d'Evreux, Marguerite (wife of Edward I of England), and Blanche, wife of Rudolf I of Germany. Due to her influence Philip became involved in the affairs of the Angevins and in hostilities with the Kingdom of Aragon.<br>
</p>
John DE BRAOSE
<p>
<a name ="I007438"><b>[I007438]</b></a><br />
From Wikipedia, 12 June 2006:<br>
<br>
John de Braose, called Tadody (1198-July 18, 1232) was the Welsh Marches lord of Bramber and Gower. He was the eldest son of William de Braose (himself son of William de Braose, Fourth Lord of Bramber) and Matilda de Clare, the daughter of Richard de Clare, 4th Earl of Hertford.<br>
<br>
John was nicknamed Tadody ("fatherless" in Welsh) after his father was starved to death in 1210 on the orders of King John I of England. At first he was hidden in Gower, but finally in 1214 his guardian surrendered John and his younger brother Philip. In June 1215 John was present for the signing of the Magna Carta. He was released from custody in 1218, having spent some time with his uncle Giles, Bishop of Hertford.<br>
<br>
Much of his adult life was spent in disputes with relatives over his inheritance. In 1219 he married Marared, the daughter of Llywelyn Fawr, and received Gower as her dowry. In 1226 his uncle Reginald de Braose sold him Bramber, and he inherited still more when this uncle died a few years later. He and Marared had three sons, including his heir, William.<br>
<br>
In 1232 John was killed in a fall from his horse.<br>

<br>
Reginald supported Giles in his rebellions against King John. They were both active against the King in the barons' war. Neither was present at the signing of Magna Carta because they were still rebels who refused to compromise King John aquiesced to Reginald's claims to the de Braose estates in Wales in May 1216. He became Lord of Brecon, Abergavenny, Builth and other Marcher Lordships but was very much a vassal of Llewelyn Fawr, Prince of Gwynedd and now his father-in-law. Henry III restoredReginald to favour and the Bramber estates (confiscated from William by King John) in 1217. At this seeming betrayal, Rhys and Owain, Reginald's nephews who were princes of Deheubarth, were incensed and they took Builth (except the castle). Llewelyn Fawr also became angry and beseiged Brecon. Reginald eventually surrendered to Llewelyn and gave up Seinenydd (Swansea). By 1221 they were at war again with Llewelyn laying seige to Builth. The seige was relieved by Henry III's forces. From this time on Llewelyn tended to support the claims of Reginald's nephew John concerning the de Braose lands.<br>
<br>
Reginald was a witness to the re-issue of Magna Carta by Henry III in1225.<br>

Reginald DE BRAOSE
<p>
<a name ="I004648"><b>[I004648]</b></a><br />
From Wikipedia<br>
<br>
Reginald de Braose (died 1227) was the son of William de Braose, 4th Lord of Bramber and Matilda de St. Valery. He was a scion of the powerful Marcher family of Braose, and related by marriage to the Princes of Wales.<br>
<br>
He supported his brother Giles in his rebellions against King John. They were both active against the King in the baron's war. Neither was present at the signing of Magna Carta because they were still rebels who refused to compromise. John acquiesced to Reginald's claims to the de Braose estates in Wales in May 1216. He became Lord of Brecon, Abergavenny, Builth and other Marcher Lordships but was very much a vassal of Llewelyn Fawr, Prince of Gwynedd who became his father-in-law in 1222 when Reginald married Llywelyn's daughter, Gwladys Ddu. Henry III restored Reginald to favour and the Bramber estates (confiscated from William by King John) in 1217. At this seeming betrayal, Rhys and Owain, Reginald's nephews who were princes of Deheubarth, were incensed and they took Builth (except the castle). Llywelyn Fawr also became angry and besieged Brecon. Reginald eventually surrendered to Llewelyn and gave up Seinhenydd (Swansea). By 1221 they were at war again with Llewelyn laying siege to Builth. The siege was relieved by Henry III's forces. From this time on Llewelyn tended to support the claims of Reginald's nephew John de Braose concerning the de Braose lands.<br>
<br>
Reginald was a witness to the re-issue of Magna Carta by Henry III in 1225. He died two years later and was succeeded by his son, the ill-fated William de Braose, Lord of Abergavenny. His daughter Matilda was the wife of Rhys Mechyll, Prince of Deheubarth.<br>
</p>
William DE BRAOSE
<p>
<a name ="I004645"><b>[I004645]</b></a><br />
From Wikipedia<br>
<br>
William de Braose, Lord of Abergavenny (c. 1197 - May 2, 1230) was the son of Reginald de Braose by his first wife, Gracia de Briwere. The Welsh, who detested him, called him Gwilym Ddu (Black William). He succeeded his father in his various lordships in 1227, including Abergavenny and Builth.<br>
<br>
He was married to Eva Marshall, daughter of the famous William Marshall. They had four daughters and coheiresses:<br>
   1. Isabella, wife of Prince Dafydd ap Llywelyn<br>
   2. Maud, wife of Roger Mortimer, 1st Baron Wigmore<br>
   3. Eleanor, wife of Humphrey de Bohun<br>
   4. Eve, wife of William de Cantelou<br>
<br>
He was captured and imprisoned (as an act of retaliation) by Llywelyn the Great, ruler of most of Wales, in 1229, but was given relative freedom because he was related to the prince by marriage in several ways; his daughter, Isabella, was married to Llywelyn's only legitimate son. However, William then began an affair with Llywelyn's wife, the Princess Joan. The Chronicle of Ystrad Fflur entry for 1230 reads:<br>
    "In this year William de Breos the Younger, lord of Brycheiniog, was hanged by the Lord Llywelyn in Gwynedd, after he had been caught in Llywelyn's chamber with the king of England's daughter, Llywelyn's wife."<br>
<br>
Llywelyn had William hanged on May 2, 1230. Joan herself was later pardoned.<br>
