Chandler Davis BAILEY
<p>
<a name ="I081546"><b>[I081546]</b></a><br />
Chan Bailey died September 8, 2016 in his home from complications of his long battle with Lymphoma. Chandler Davis Bailey was born in Great Falls, Montana on January 9, 1929 to Charles and Gertrude Bailey. In his early years, he grew up on a farm in Fort Shaw, Montana and later his family moved to Fairfield, Montana where he graduated from Fairfield High School in 1946. While in Montana, Chan enjoyed the out-of-doors; hunting and hiking and was known for his exceptional skills in competitive shooting. His father hired him for his first job as ditch rider for Greenfields Irrigation District; he later held the position of Treasurer. He assumed the position of Secretary-Manager in 1959 at age 30, where he remained until 1968. <br>
Upon the death of his first wife Evelyn in 1968, Chan moved to Othello, Washington with his four young sons. Chan first assumed the position of Assistant Manager at the East Columbia Basin Irrigation District (ECBID) and was named Secretary-Manager in 1973. In 1983 he retired from the ECBID and began working with the Columbia Basin Development League and the Department of Ecology as the Director of the Columbia Basin Commission. He was instrumental in the development of the impact statement of the second half of the East High Project. Twenty-five years later, his work became the ground work for the Odessa Groundwater Replacement Program. <br>
Two significant natural disasters were influential in Chan's career; the 100 year Montana flood in 1964 of the Gibson Dam, where the water came over the dam and flooded the Sun River Valley, and the eruption of Mt. St. Helens in 1980 that covered the farmland in the Columbia Basin with ash. As a lifetime administrator of natural resource management, these catastrophic natural disasters were two events where Chan's skills and experience were needed and appreciated by all. <br>
The most significant event of 1970 happened when he married Jeanne, and with her three children, united into a family of nine. Managing a family of this size was no small feat, and memories are shared among the siblings and grandchildren about stories of everyday living that reflect the closeness of this family. At one point, Chan and Jeanne had five children in Othello High School at the same time, which kept them busy! In addition to being the Secretary-Manager of the ECBID, he never missed any of his children's sporting events or school functions. He shared with his children his love of the outdoors - camping, fishing, hunting, trapping and inner tubing on the occasional snowy day in Othello. In Chan's "spare" time, he used his extensive home repair skills to flip houses in Othello. His children all benefited from these skills as he helped each of his children as they became homeowners. <br>
Upon retirement in 1991, Chan and Jeanne moved to Spokane, primarily because Chan wanted to be closer to his "trees" in northern Washington. In addition to providing the family a private hunting location, he enjoyed logging the trees on this property and did so until 1999. During retirement Chan and Jeanne built a vacation home in Ocean Shores, Washington and spent time walking the beach and collecting floats. They traveled extensively with friends for many years, and he especially loved Steamboatin' on the Mississippi River. Chan tremendously enjoyed his garden, cultivated a beautiful yard, and he was especially proud of his rose garden. <br>
Chan was a devoted husband, father and grandfather. He loved regaling tales of his life to anyone near enough to listen, would not wear a watch in retirement and believed in helping others. He will be deeply missed and holds a dear place in all of our hearts. <br>
Chan is preceded in death by his first wife Evelyn, his son Scott Bailey, his grandson Scott Ragan, his brother George Bailey, and his sister Margaret Neer. He is survived by his wife of 46 years, Jeanne; their children Chan (Patti) of Colbert, WA, Jennifer (Tim) Ragan of Newman Lake, WA, George (Laura) of West Richland, WA, Pamela (Jen) Staley of Kennewick, WA, Todd (Tonya) of Carpinteria, CA, Michael (Dana) of Redmond, WA, fourteen grandchildren, two great-grandchildren and sisters Eunice Hanson and Betty Purvis of Helena, MT. <br>
The family kindly requests, in lieu of flowers, donations be made to Meals on Wheels, 12101 E. Sprague, Spokane Valley, WA <br>
A Memorial Service will be held on Saturday, September 24, 2016 at 1:00 pm at Opportunity Presbyterian Church, 202 N. Pines Rd., Spokane Valley, WA 99206. Private graveside services will be held at a later date in Othello, Washington.<br>
