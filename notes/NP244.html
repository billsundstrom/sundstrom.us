Crash in California Tuesday<br>
Mr. and Mrs. Carl Hesse received word Wednesday morning that their son, Airman First Class Charles Westover Hesse, age 21, was missing as a result of a plane crash in California on Tuesday. The following text of the telegram received by Mr. and Mrs. Hesse:<br>
"It is with deep regret that I, unofficially inform you that your son, Airman First Class Charles Westover Hesse is missing as a result of an aircraft accident, 12 miles west of Gridley, Calif. January 13, 1953. Further information will be forwarded to you as soon as it is available." The commanding officer, Col. John E. Dougherly. <br>
Hesse has been in the service since September 1950, and has been stationed at Castle Air Force Base, Merced, Calif.<br>
The following is a news release by the Associated Press Wednesday morning:<br>
Oroville, Calif.--A B50 Bomber carrying a crew of 12 crashed 12 miles west of here on Tuesday. All 12 men were killed, the Air Force announced.<br>
The B50 crash was the 11th around the Pacific Rim involving military or military-chartered aircraft since Nov. 7. It boosted the death toll to 342.<br>
In Washington, the Air Force disclosed that 1,214 persons died in non-combat accidents involving its aircraft in 1952, but this rate is the lowest in history.<br>
The big four-engine B50 appeared in trouble about a mile from the marshy field into which it plunged. <br>
The ship went into a dive and crashed into a semi-flooded area. There was an explosion and flames enveloped the wreckage.<br>
Much of the surrounding land is covered with water, and the wreck scene was accessible only by jeep and by water.<br>
Officers said four bodies were found near the wreckage. The rest were believed inside. Arrangements were made to bring out the dead by helicopter. Names of the victims will be revealed today after next-of-kin are notified.<br>
The plane dived into the field about a mile off the Gridley-Colusa highway. Highway patrolmen and a company of guards from Beale Air Force Base Marysville, Calif., surrounded the area. <br>
The Air Force announced the bomber, an improved version of the B29 of World War II was on a routine training flight from Castle Air Force Base, near Merced, 165 miles to the south.<br>
The plane crashed on the 5,000-acre ranch off M.D. shore. Chet Talley, a ranch hand, said the plane "just came down out of the sky like a wounded bat." Another ranch employee said the aircraft sounded as though it were having engine trouble shortly before it crashed.<br>
Mrs. George Dawley, a resident of nearby Biggs, said the plane "just cleared the houses" as it roared over the town but did not sound as though it were in trouble at that time."<br>
Funeral Services to Be Held Today<br>
Funeral services for Airman First Class Charles Westover Hesse, will be held at the Congregational church in Sauk Centre at 2 pm today, Thursday. Hesse was killed in an airplane crash in California last week.<br>
The body was shipped here and arrived last night and will be at the Corrigan Funeral Home until the time of the funeral. The complete obituary will be printed next week.<br>
