Alan McDonal of GALLOWAY
<p>
<a name ="I008830"><b>[I008830]</b></a><br />
Alan FitzRoland (c.1175-1234) was the last of the MacFergus dynasty of quasi-independent Lords of Galloway. He was also hereditary Constable of Scotland. He was the son of Roland of Galloway and Helen de Moreville. His date of birth is uncertain, but he was born in or before 1175, as he is considered an adult in 1196.<br>
<br>
He married firstly to an unnamed daughter of John, Baron of Pontefract and Constable of Chester; they had two daughters, one named Helen (married Roger de Quincy, 2nd Earl of Winchester) and another who died in 1213. His first wife was dead or divorced by 1209, when he married Margaret of Huntingdon, great granddaughter of David 1st of Scotland. By this marriage he had two more daughters: Derbhorgail and Christian (who married William de Forz, Count of Aumale). Alan married his last wife, Rohese de Lacy, in 1229, she being the daughter of Hugh de Lacy, 1st Earl of Ulster. By one of his marriages he had a son, Thomas, who predeceased his father (not to be confused with his illegitimate half-brother, also named Thomas).<br>
<br>
In 1212 Alan responded to a summons from King John I of England by sending 1,000 troops to join the war against the Welsh. In this year he also sent one of his daughters to England as a hostage. She died in 1213 in the custody of her maternal uncle. Alan is listed as one of the 16 men who counseled King John regarding Magna Carta.<br>
<br>
Alan, like his forebears, maintained a carefully ambiguous relationship with both the English and Scottish states, acting as a vassal when it suited his purpose and as an independent monarch when he could get away with it. His considerable sea power allowed him to supply fleets and armies to aid the English King John in campaigns both in France and Ireland.<br>
<br>
In 1228 he invaded the Isle of Man and fought a sea-war against Norway in support of Reginald, Prince of Man, who was engaged in a fratricidal struggle with his brother Olaf for possession of the island.<br>
<br>
Alan died in 1234 and is buried at Dundrennan Abbey in Galloway. With Alan's death his holdings were divided between his three daughters. A popular attempt was made within Galloway to establish his illegitimate son, Thomas, as ruler, but this failed, and Galloway's period as an independent political entity came to an end.<br>

Fergus of GALLOWAY
<p>
<a name ="I008845"><b>[I008845]</b></a><br />
From Wikipedia<br>
<br>
Fergus of Galloway was Lord of Galloway from about 1138 until his death in 1161. He was a noble in the court of King David I of Scotland, and may have been descended from earlier princes of Galloway. He accompanied David to the English court during David's tenure as Prince of Cumbria. His wife's name is unknown, but she may have been an illegitimate daughter of King Henry I of England. They had three children:<br>
   1. Uchtred of Galloway<br>
   2. Gilbert of Galloway<br>
   3. Aufrica of Galloway, married King Olaf I of the Isle of Man<br>
<br>
Fergus was a prominent noble under King David, and was probably appointed Lord of Galloway after the Battle of the Standard in 1138. He built many religious houses, abbeys, and chapels all across Galloway, and enjoyed a peaceful reign until after King David's death. In 1160 Fergus rebelled against the new king, Malcolm IV of Scotland, and joined Somerled of Argyll in ravaging the west coast. Somerled and Fergus' rebellion was defeated in 1161; Somerled was slain in 1164, but Fergus had retired to the abbey of Holyroodhouse, where he became a canon regular and died shortly thereafter, leaving Galloway to his two sons.<br>

Uchtred of GALLOWAY
<p>
<a name ="I005446"><b>[I005446]</b></a><br />
From Wikipedia<br>
<br>
Uchtred FitzFergus (c.1120-September 22, 1174) was Lord of Galloway from 1161 to 1174, ruling jointly with his brother Gilbert of Galloway. They were sons of Fergus of Galloway; their mother may have been an illegitimate daughter of King Henry I of England.<br>
<br>
As a boy he was sent as a hostage to the court of King Malcolm IV of Scotland. When his father, Prince Fergus, died in 1161, Uchtred was made co-ruler of Galloway along with Gilbert. They participated in King William I of Scotland's disastrous invasion of Northumberland in 1174. King William was captured, and the Galwegians rebelled, taking the opportunity to slaughter the Norman and Saxon settlers in their land. During this time Uchtred was brutally mutilated, blinded, castrated, and killed by his brother Gilbert and Gilbert's son, Malcolm. Gilbert then seized control of Galloway entire.<br>
<br>
Uchtred had married Gunhilda of Dunbar, and they were the parents of Roland of Galloway and Eve of Galloway, wife of Walter de Berkeley.<br>
