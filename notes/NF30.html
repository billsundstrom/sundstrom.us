Our Story<br>
This is my (Emily's) version of the story - Iʼm sure Brock has other details about the engagement and the ring - ones that I missed or just may not know. And Iʼm sure heʼd be VERY happy to tell you his version of the story if you just ask. So, please do! We like sharing it :)<br>
<br>
The Engagement<br>
Shenandoah State Park - White Oak Canyon Trails - Lower Falls<br>
I have to laugh when I think about it now, but Brock had me COMPLETELY convinced we were "just going hiking". I even asked "hey, are you going to propose this weekend?" Who DOES that!? I told him he had to ask my Mom and Dad first (no proposals without THAT approval!) and he just said "well, between work, coaching and fixing your condo, when have I had time to talk to your parents!?" . . . so there he had me, absolutely convinced we were just going to lunch and then hiking!<br>
November 22nd, 2008 - We left early in the morning after dropping Chipper off at "Gammyʼs" for the day. It took about 4 hours to get to Graves Mountain, and we took the scenic route. It was absolutely gorgeous! Farms and wineries, rolling hills and cute little towns, the drive alone was worth the trip! Lunch at the lodge was served family style, and while I had my reservations about eating with a table full of strangers, little did I know that the nice people we met became key to Brockʼs engagement plan! After a delicious meal, complete with coffee and gingerbread cake, Brock and I took to exploring the lodge and surrounding grounds. Taking pictures, I had NO idea I was going to be the future Mrs. Brock Thompson in just a few hours!<br>
After lunch Brock and I stopped along the road to the hiking trails and bought a bag of Virginia apples, MMmm! Then we headed down some crazy twisty roads to the Shenandoah State Park where our lunch table guests also mentioned great hiking trails, complete with a waterfall!<br>
We put on all the warm clothes, jackets, scarves, gloves and hats we could manage (did I mention it was 33 degrees that day!?) and started out on our hike. We found a walking stick along the way and waved at all the people we passed along the trail. I tried not to think about the fact that everyone we passed was headed BACK to the cars (where it was WARM!) and we kept following the blue ribbons to the waterfall that everyone was talking about. Brock took lots of pictures and I climbed on lots of rocks.<br>
Finally, we heard the waterfall up ahead! As we arrived, I was amazed at how gorgeous a cold, grey day could make a freezing cold waterfall look. It was a winter wonderland, of sorts, icicles dripping from partially submerged rocks, perfect fall leaves frozen beneath still pools of water, and the white waterfall, roaring in the background. And I, like the crazy person I am, wanted to feel how cold the water was and took off my gloves! As I climbed around the waterfall, Brock asked me to hold still for a picture. He set the timer (like the pro he is) and ran around to be in the picture with me. I didnʼt understand why he was ignoring my shouts that the camera wasnʼt working as he ran towards me. Usually the light flashes to indicate that the timer has been set. Almost immediately, and without any warning, heʼs on his knee, with a box and a ring, asking "Emily Anne Croft, will you marry me?" . . . .<br>
. . . .and I laughed! I laughed till I cried and laughed some more. I was so surprised! He asked me if "that was a yes?" . . . and of course it was! Weʼre engaged!<br>
For the record, Brock took it as a divine sign that I'd taken my gloves off (all the better for putting a ring on my hand) and also that we were completly alone (and boy were we alone! I think we were the only people in the park at that point - the last waterfall admirers were leaving as we arrived.) ALSO: he DID ask my Dad for my hand in marriage (which is another good story!) so he was technically correct in assuring me that he hadn't talked to my "parents". Lastly, he'd set the camera to 'video' which is why the little light wasn't flashing and we now have a tiny little video of the best day of our lives!<br>
<br>
The Ring<br>
After the shock of the proposal, of course I had to ask about the ring! It was gorgeous, better than I could have picked out in a store. And that was exactly the case! Brock worked with local a jeweler, David Nygaard, to design the ring himself. It had all the details that I loved, but couldnʼt find in one ring together. Apparently there were many store visits, and endless debating between diamonds - but my man did GOOD and I LOVE my engagement ring! Also, Mr. Nygaard is a local business (one of my requests: to support a local jewelry shop, not a national chain) and he home schools his family. I thought that was sweet. Oh oh! And it princess cut - LOVE IT!<br>

The Birdsall Methodist Church was the scene of a very pretty wedding last Saturday evening, April 4, 1959, at seven o'clock, when Miss Mary Ollie Burdick, daughter of Mr. and Mrs. Park Burdick, Angelica, became the bride of Don Marvin Halladay, son of Marvin Halladay of Wellsville.<br>
The single ring ceremony was solemnized by the pastor of the church, the Rev. E. L. Eldredge, before the church altar, which was decorated with baskets of spring flowers.<br>
Traditional wedding music was played by Mrs. E. L. Eldredge.<br>
The bride was lovely in a ballerina length white lace over satin gown, fashioned with wide midriff of eyelet lace, laced with white satin ribbon, a white lace jacket with three-quarter length sleeves and her veil of illusion fell from a seed pearl headpiece. She carried a bouquet of red Sweetheart roses on a white Bible.<br>
Mrs. Velma Burdick, sister-in-law of the bride, was matron of honor and wore a gown of blue lace over satin with a blue flower headband and carried white carnations.<br>
Carl Aldrich of Stannards acted as best man.<br>
The bride's mother, Mrs. Burdick, was attired in a white wool sheath costume with pink accessories and wore a corsage of pink roses.<br>
The ushers were Manley Baer and Marvin Halladay of Wellsville, nephew s of the groom.<br>
Following the ceremony, a reception for the immediate family and close friends was held at the home of the bride's parents. The bride's table was centered with a four-tiered wedding cake, topped with the traditional miniature bride and groom. The cake was cut by Mrs. Bernice Burdick of Almond, sister-in-law of College. Mr. Olson graduated from Warren High School in 1954 and then served with the paratroopers. At present, he is attending Jamestown Community College. A July wedding is planned.
