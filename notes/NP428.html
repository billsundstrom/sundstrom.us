Robert Harrison PILK
<p>
<a name ="I093502"><b>[I093502]</b></a><br />
Something odd about Robert Pilk.  In the 2000's he has been registered to vote in Winter Springs, FL.  Yet there is a grave with his name showing that he died in 1970 in Vietnam.  Both have the same birthdays. <br>
I found the following ( http://thewall-usa.com/mboard.asp?curpage=484&searchtext= ) which may explain the contradiction:<br>
Robert Harrison Pilk<br>
. . Contributed By One Upset Daughter On Friday, March 25, 2005<br>
This is my fathers name. I am very proud of him! All he did for our country. For all of his friends and Army family that he had in Veitnam the 7th Calvary. I feel somehow that his memory has somewhat been tanted. You see his brother one of his brothers, is using his name his family, wife and three children have always known him as Robert "BOB" Harrison Pilk. Their is even a JR. The family just found out at the Tragic death of my dads mother. How can this happen I have not had contact with these people. How can he steal my fathers identiy? Is this something that happens to our War Heros ? Very upset!<br>
