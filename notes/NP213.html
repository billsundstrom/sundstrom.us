Peter Alden GRIFFIN
<p>
<a name ="I098830"><b>[I098830]</b></a><br />
Peter Griffin considered himself a professor first. He was a dedicated mathematics professor at California State University, Sacramento, but it was gambling - blackjack in particular - that kept his mind active and made him well-known. <br>
Mr. Griffin wrote two books on blackjack, "The Theory of Blackjack" and "Extra Stuff, Gambling Ramblings." <br>
Mr. Griffin, 61, died last Sunday of prostate cancer, which was diagnosed four weeks ago. <br>
A native of New Jersey, Mr. Griffin grew up in Chicago and Portland, Ore. After earning his bachelor's degree from Portland State University, he came to California to attend graduate school. Mr. Griffin received his master's in mathematics from the University of California, Davis, and began teaching at CSUS in 1965. <br>
"He was renowned in the gambling world. We traveled the world - Europe, Australia, across the U.S. - for gambling," said Lydia Griffin , his wife. "People would ask him to analyze gambling problems. <br>
"Teaching was his main love, but yet he loved gambling, and the spark of his life became the math in gambling," Lydia Griffin said. "He was not a gambler at all. He really didn't like gambling. But he enjoyed the mathematics of it and the people he met through it." <br>
Mr. Griffin worked for Las Vegas and Reno casinos as a consultant, his wife said. A witty man, Mr. Griffin was contacted often by newspapers, radio and television for his insights on statistics and probability in casino gambling and the lottery. <br>
Anthony Curtis, a longtime friend and publisher, said of Mr. Griffin : "There's a case to be made that there's no bigger name in the world of blackjack. Peter was considered the dean of the science of blackjack. His "Theory of Blackjack' was literally the bible for all serious blackjack players." <br>
Curtis said that although many books were written about how to play blackjack, Mr. Griffin 's book explained the theory and the math behind it. <br>
"For all of his mathematical firepower, this guy was equally verbally powerful," Curtis said. "He was a tremendous speaker." <br>
In addition to his wife, Mr. Griffin is survived by a sister, Barbara Dann, and a brother, Alan Griffin , both of Salem, Ore. <br>
At his request, there will be no service. A celebration of his life will be held Nov. 1 from 2-5 p.m. at the Old Spaghetti Factory, 1910 J St. The family requests that any remembrances be made to the SPCA or the Sacramento Zoo.<br>
Caption: Peter Griffin He presented his theories on blackjack worldwide, but did not enjoy gambling himself.<br>

Grimaldus m. Unknown.  According to the genealogy of the Suffolk family of Bacon, one Grimald, or Grimaldus, a relative of the Norman chieftain, William de Warrenne, came to England in 1066 at the time of the Conquest and settled near Holt, in County Suffolk. His son, or Great Grandson Robert, took the surname Bacon, or rather assumed the use of the place-name as a surname. In the north of France the surname Bacon is still in use. William Bacon in 1082 endowed the Abbey of Holy Trinity at Caen. The surname Bacon is found in the Battle Rolls in England in the eleventh century and in the Hundred Rolls in the thirteenth. There are occasional variations in spelling, such as Bacun and Bachun, and in some instances the surname Bacon may have been corrupted from Beacon. Some derive the surname from the Saxon baccen or baccen, a beech tree.<br>
