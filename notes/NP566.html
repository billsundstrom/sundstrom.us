By Opal Walker<br>
My husband Daryl Walker was born and raised in New Sharon, Iowa.  Several of his relatives are buried in cemeteries nearby.  Three of his grandparents, one great and two great-greats, were buried without markers in the Stuart Cemetery.  All the records were destroyed in a fire many years ago.  Daryl knew approximately the location and wanted to mark the spots, and is planning to get a tombstone for them.  Today, we found the graves with some help from Phyllis Nicholson.  She knows how to do grave witching.  You locate the graves with a stick from a peach tree or you can use two wires.  My daughter Diana Mandity and son Mike Scholtus also tried their hand at finding graves.  Such a good day for Daryl!  Thanks Phyllis for the help.<br>

The former things have passed away." This promise was very real to him.<br>
Gary's hobbies included fishing, reading Louis L'Amour and Erie Stanley Gardner novels and watching sports of all kinds [especially the Hawkeyes].

[which usually ended up all over their clothes].<br>
