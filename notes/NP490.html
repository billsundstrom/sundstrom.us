Abbie Louise SHAW
<p>
<a name ="I028796"><b>[I028796]</b></a><br />
Abbie (Shaw) Young, a highly respected and much beloved resident of Waterville, passed away at her home, on the morning of March 27th. She was 75 years of age, having been born on June 5th, 1850, and was the youngest of a family of seven children of the late Sydney and Caroline (Skinner) Shaw, whose home was in Waterville, where the early years of the deceased were spent.<br>
She first married John L. West of Morristown, and went to reside in Kansas, where one son, Claude L., who survives her was born to them, his father dying when he was about 3 years of age. Mrs. West then returned to her home in Waterville, where she married Mr. W. V. T. Young, nearly 50 years ago. Five children were born to them, of whom three survive, LeRoy, of New York and Sydney, of Winnipeg, Man., having predeceased her a few years ago. The surviving ones are Claude L. West, of Newark, N.J.; Mrs. Allen Young, Swampscott, Mass.; Mrs. Owen Craig, of Vulcan, Alberta, and Vaughn, who resides in Waterville. Eleven grandchildren also survive.<br>
The funeral took place from the Baptist Church, of which she was a faithful member, Rev. G. R. T. Ayling officiating, assisted by Rev. John MCI of the United Church.<br>
The floral offerings were most beautiful and especially appropriate, as the deceased was always a lover of flowers and as long as she was able kept herself surrounded by them in her home. Her eyesight had failed her during the last few years and her only complaint was of missing the eight of the beautiful things of earth. A loving friend and neighbor has passed from our midst, sweet memories of whom will ever remain with those who knew her.<br>
The husband, children and grandchildren have the sincere sympathy of a large circle of friends.<br>

While his record represents some commendable achievements in practical business, Mr. Shearer is also widely known over Wayne County for his participation in movements looking to the raising of moral standards and the betterment of civic conditions generally. He was born in Wayne County November 5, 1850.<br>
His grandfather was Jacob Shearer, a native of Virginia, who lived in Wayne County from early manhood until his death in 1860. Francis D. Shearer, father of the Monticello merchant, spent all his life in Wayne County, where he died at the age of seventy- two. His vocation was that of farming. He was independent in politics and a leading member of the<br>

Shearer attended the common schools of Wayne County, lived on his father's farm until he was twenty, and then for several years engaged in farming on his own account. His place of business up to 1897 was twelve miles west of Monticello, where he conducted a general store. Then, seeking broader opportunities for his commercial talents, he established a general mercantile business at Monticello and has had an active part among the retail merchants of the city ever since. He owns an interest in the store building. He has been vice president of the Cumberland Grocery Company since 1905. The main offices of this company are at Burnside, and it is the principal wholesale grocery organization between Danville, Kentucky, and Knoxville, Tennessee.
