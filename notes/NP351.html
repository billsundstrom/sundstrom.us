Calhoun Allen MAYS
<p>
<a name ="I090030"><b>[I090030]</b></a><br />
Calhoun Allen Mays , Jr., 89, died November 10, 2016. Not only was he a well-known businessman and real estate developer, he was an enthusiastic and heartfelt advocate for his native Greenwood County and all of its people. <br>
He was the husband of Ella Claire Mays . He was born October 2, 1927, a son of the late Calhoun Allen Mays and Mazie Trammell Mays . He attended the public schools of Greenwood and was a graduate of the University of South Carolina. <br>
Calhoun Mays was a visionary. He saw unexplored possibilities for Greenwood that he skillfully brought to fruition. Many areas of the City and County of Greenwood, including Gatewood, Chinquapin and other residential communities, resulted from his efforts to provide a wide range of living and affordable opportunities that were fundamental to a growing area of the Piedmont section of South Carolina and beyond. <br>
His vision, it seemed, was unlimited. He was able to look at a parcel of land and see in his mind's eye the kind and size of house that would please every taste and budget. Furthermore, his ideas would inevitably enhance the natural beauty in landscapes that others could not see. Visualizing advantageous qualities of natural surroundings was, in fact, second nature to him. <br>
There were numerous aspects of his success in a diversity of business ventures. He was an innovative builder and developer, as seen in the Gatewood Club, with dining and other clubhouse facilities that added appeal to prospective residents of Gatewood Community. A swimming pool and tennis courts helped provide the entire complex with a family atmosphere conducive to inspiring neighborhood and overall community events and celebrations. He also turned Gatewood into a gated community, something new for Greenwood. This provided a security measure, of course, but it also made peace and quiet integral and attractive factors for residents. <br>
There was much more to Calhoun Mays than met the eye. He was an astute businessman. That was obvious. But, he often worked behind the scenes in a variety of civic, social, and industrial ventures that accrued to the benefit of all of Greenwood. It was descriptive of his character that he never sought praise or recognition for his efforts. He was satisfied with the knowledge that his unsung endeavors were positive reflections on the hometown and people he admired, respected and indeed loved more than anyone might imagine. <br>
In short, Calhoun Mays had great affection for the Emerald City and County that he was always proud to call home. Being a tireless supporter of Greenwood was part of his being. One project serves as a prime example of his interest and determination to make Greenwood a better place for its people of today and many tomorrows: that is the Emerald Triangle in Uptown Greenwood. <br>
He was actively involved in making the old post office building a shining home for the arts. The renovation and beautification of Greenwood Community Theatre speaks to the pleasure and comfort of audiences, and the improved conditions and environment for those involved in bringing entertainment to the theater's stage are extraordinary. The remodeling of The Museum highlights Greenwood's history and introduces an entertaining and educational experience for all. <br>
There was another defining facet of Calhoun Mays ' interest in the world around him: he was one of the founders of the Humane Society of Greenwood, a significant part of the soul of any community. It offered a peek at the compassionate nature and moral fiber that played a major role in his life. <br>
<br>
Through civic activities and other means, he was often out front in developing and building projects that would prove to be valuable assets to the economic base of the entire area. Through the building division of his Town and Country Real Estate Company, which he organized in 1950, he helped change the face of Greenwood. It was done in a way that told the rest of the world that progress and quality of life were two of the city's and county's most important products. <br>
A few of his civic and business contributions included service on the Piedmont Technical College Foundation for 20 years, member of the Rotary Club where he had many years of perfect attendance, and involvement in the development of Palmetto Dunes resort on Hilton Head Island. He was an agent of New York Life Insurance Co. in Greenwood for 61 years. <br>
He was a member of First Presbyterian Church in Greenwood where he served as a deacon. <br>
In addition to his wife, survivors include his son, Calhoun Allen Mays III and his wife, Cathy Faulkner Mays ; his daughter, Anne Mays Clinkscales; five granddaughters, Hunter Mays Ward and husband, Jason Ward; Lee Mays Varner and husband, Daniel Varner; Alison Ruth Mays ; St. Claire Lee Clinkscales; and Sarah Catherine Clinkscales; four great-grandchildren, Harrison Ward; Kate Ward; Daniel Varner, Jr.; and Charlie Varner. <br>
Funeral services will be held at 2 p.m. Sunday, November 27, 2016 at First Presbyterian Church in Greenwood. <br>
