Burr Cartwright BRUNDAGE
<p>
<a name ="I025003"><b>[I025003]</b></a><br />
Dr. Burr C. Brundage, an author and retired professor of history at Eckerd College, died Friday (April 16, 1993) at Westminster Shores Health Center. He was 80.<br>
A linguist and cat fancier who lent his name to a mountain in Antarctica, he was an expert on the Aztec and Inca civilizations.<br>
But he considered himself primarily a poet, he said in a 1986 interview after publication of The King Who Cast No Shadow, an epic poem about King Arthur.<br>
""I have always written poetry,'' he said.<br>
Since his retirement from Eckerd in 1978, he had written several other books of poems, including No Chance Encounter.<br>
He was appointed a professor of history at Florida Presbyterian College in 1962, four years after the liberal arts school was founded. Its name was changed in 1972 to Eckerd College.<br>
The son of a pediatrician, Mr. Brundage was born in Buffalo, N.Y. A frail boy, he became familiar with this area when his mother brought him to Pass-a-Grille and St. Petersburg in the 1920s to escape Buffalo's winters.<br>
""The streets were brick then, with no curbing, and there were turkey buzzards every place,'' he said in the 1986 interview. ""There was an old wooden bridge to Pass-a-Grille, and the beach there stretched out about a mile. I used to climb on the girders of the Don (CeSar Beach Resort) when it was being built. When I was 8 years old, I went through every book in the Mirror Lake Library.''<br>
Traveling later with his family to Europe, he spent much of his time at the British Museum, visiting the Egyptology room virtually every afternoon and laying the groundwork for the direction of his education.<br>
An honors graduate in history from Amherst College, he was working on his doctorate in Egyptology at the University of Chicago's Oriental Institute when World War II began unfolding. As he got his degree in 1939, top-ranked German archaeologists fled to this country to escape Hitler and took most of the jobs in the discipline.<br>
Dr. Brundage had concentrated on Spanish in college and shifted to Latin American history, specializing in pre-Columbian American Indian History.<br>
In addition to Spanish, he spoke French and could read Italian, German, Latin, Egyptian hieroglyphic (old, middle and new kingdoms), Demotic, Hebrew, Coptic, and Quechua, the language of the Incas, and Nahuatl, the language of the Aztecs.<br>
His books included The Empire of the Inca (1963), Lords of Cuzco (1967) and A Rain of Darts (1972). He also wrote Gian Carlo, published in 1975 by Valkyrie Press, about his Siamese cat, and The Juniper Palace (1951), a book of poems.<br>
He began his teaching career at MacMurray College in Jacksonville, Ill. He also taught at Carleton College in Northfield, Minn. Before joining Florida Presbyterian, he was History Department chairman at Cedar Crest College at Allentown, Pa.<br>
During World War II, he worked in the Office of Coordinator of Inter-American Affairs and as political desk officer for Chile at the U.S. State Department.<br>
A mountain was named after him at the base of Palmer Peninsula in Antarctica. He once said it was done in recognition of work he did for the cause of polar exploration while working for the government.<br>
Survivors include his wife, Virginia; a daughter, Christina Brundage, St. Petersburg; and a granddaughter, Anya Clancy-Brown, Clearwater.<br>
C. E. Prevatt Funeral Home, Tyrone Chapel, is in charge of arrangements.<br>
