James Harold DOOLITTLE
<p>
<a name ="I086936"><b>[I086936]</b></a><br />
World War II Congressional Medal of Honor Recipient, Aviation Pioneer. He was born in Alameda, California, in 1896, but his family moved to Nome, Alaska, when he was 4-years-old. He showed a keen interest in flying from an early age. At the age of 15, he built a glider from plans he found in Popular Mechanics magazine. While at the University of California, he studied mining engineering, but left college with one year remaining to join the United States Army Signal Corps as part of the American Expeditionary Forces, which were headed to Europe in World War I. Once the war was over, he set a series of aviation records, including being the first pilot to fly coast to coast in less than a day. In September 1922, he took off from Jacksonville, Florida, and landed in San Diego, California, 20 hours and 30 minutes later. He also made the first instrument flight; taking off, flying, and landing without seeing beyond his instrument panel. In 1927, he earned his Ph.D in aeronautical engineering from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. He worked for Shell Oil Company throughout the 1930s, but was recalled to active duty in 1940 with the rank of Major. He was placed in command of a flying unit that came to be known as "Doolittle's Raiders." On April 18, 1942, 80 pilots flew 16 B-25s from the deck of the aircraft carrier Hornet. After the stirring attack on Japan, most of the men were forced to bail out over mainland China. Sixty-nine of them landed in friendly territory. His leadership of the attack earned him the Medal of Honor. The attack was the subject of a 1944 movie, "Thirty Seconds over Tokyo," starring Spencer Tracy. He was placed in command of the 12th Air Force in Britain, the 15th Air Force, which took part in the invasion of North Africa and Italy, and the 8th Air Force, which later attacked Germany. He was promoted to Lieutenant General in 1944, and held the rank of General when he left the Army in 1946. He returned to once again work for Shell Oil after the service. In 1989, President George H.W. Bush awarded him the Presidential Medal of Freedom. He died in Pebble Beach, California. His MOH was presented to him on June 9, 1942. His citation states: For conspicuous leadership above the call of duty, involving personal valor and intrepidity at an extreme hazard to life. With the apparent certainty of being forced to land in enemy territory or to perish at sea, Gen. Doolittle personally led a squadron of Army bombers, manned by volunteer crews, in a highly destructive raid on the Japanese mainland. <br>

Berwick mother on son's dark road -<br>
A grieving mother shared the pain of losing her son to his addictions, driving home the immediate need for improved support and treatment services for addicts.<br>
After years spent fighting addictions to alcohol and drugs, Harlan Dorey of Berwick gave into despair and took his own life February 15. He was just 27 years old.<br>
"Harlan's dad died 14 years ago. He never got over his dadʼs death. He coped by drinking and also picked up drugs," said his mother, Linda Dorey. <br>
"He didnʼt see the good in life."<br>
All that changed in April 2010, when Harlan admitted he needed help.<br>
"He was sick of the life he was living. He wanted help."<br>
Getting that help presented one challenge after another. <br>
"We reached out together to get help," but the family's financial burdens put private treatment options out of reach, explained Linda. Harlan entered local detox programs, but never received one-on-one counseling that could have improved his chances of kicking his addictions. After finally receiving a referral for a 21-day treatment program, he learned in January he would require more outpatient counseling before getting a space in the program.<br>
"He was devastated."<br>
In desperation, Harlan tried to get methadone treatment from the Mud Creek Clinic in Wolfville.<br>
"He was turned away when he went there. He was told there was a two-month waiting list," for the treatment, said Linda.<br>
From that point on, her son fell into a deep depression.<br>
"He kept slipping further and further away," said Linda through tears. <br>
"When I saw him Feb. 15 for the last time, he told me 'I canʼt fight anymore'."<br>
When she came home from work later that day, Linda found her son hanging from the ceiling light in his room.<br>
Harlan's death brought an end to "the dark, dark, long road" her son had been on for many years.<br>
"I donʼt blame anyone for his choices. He had his struggles, but he was a worthy human being."<br>
Acknowledging "we have a crisis on our hands," Linda is pleading for the community to pull together and demand our government do something to help addicts.<br>
"And, if one life can be saved, then I'll say it was in honour of my son, Harlan Dorey."<br>
