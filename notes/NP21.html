Sarah BALDWIN
<p>
<a name ="I006885"><b>[I006885]</b></a><br />
According to "Field Genealogy," Sarah (Baldwin) (Searle) Edwards was a daughter of Sylvester Baldwin who died on the ship "Martin" while travelling to New England. His widow settled at New Haven then Milford, CT with her children. However, Savage and the "Register," discussing the will of Benjamin Fenn, indicates that Sarah Baldwin, daughter of Sylvester Baldwin, married, as his first wife, Benjamin Fenn. Given that John Searle was of Springfield, MA and Alexander Edwards was of Northampton, it seems less likely that this Sarah Baldwin, residentof CT, was daughter of Sylvester.<br>
<br>
Perhaps this Sarah was sister of Joseph Baldwin, an early settler of Milford, CT. He and his wife were admitted as members of the church there 23 June 1644 and, in about 1663, Joseph and his wife removed to Hadley.<br>
<br>
According to website "Baldwin Family History" by Stephen Chinn and A Supplement to the Baldwin Genealogy by Charles Candee Baldwin provided by Judy Burritt: [burritt@@cfw.com]: Sarah, daughter of Richard Baldwin & IsabelHarding b. 25 Jun 1621 in Aston Clinton, Buckinghamshire, England; m. (1) JohnSearle on 19 Mar 1639 in Springfield, MA; d.3 Oct 1690 in Northampton, MA.<br>
<br>
Richard, son of Richard Baldwin & Isabel Chase b.15 Jun 1576 in Aston Clinton; m. Isabel Harding on 15 May 1598 in Buckinghamshire, England; d. bef. 16 May 1633 in Aston Clinton.<br>
<br>
Richard, son of Richard Edward Baldwin & Ellen Apuke b.1540 in Aston Clinton; m. Isabel Chase abt 1575 in Aston Clinton; d. there on18Feb 1632.<br>

Bobbie was born in Garden Valley, Idaho, to Robert and Odessa Banka on March 3, 1938.<br>
Family was always a priority and she loved to spend time with her younger siblings, Marion Strandy of Spokane, Wash., Judy and Paul Lucas of Pahrump, Nev., Linda and Ron Collison of Sandpoint, Idaho, Kay and Coy Kratz of Pahrump, Ed and Wilma Banka of Las Vegas, Nev. Teddy and Wally Huggins of Bonners Ferry, Idaho, and Ron and Debi Banka of Spokane.<br>
At age 16, Bobbie met Gary playing hide-and-go-seek and went on to marry the love of her life on July 3, 1954, in Thermopolis, Wyo. Together they raised four children, LeAnn and Mike Engels of Pahrump, Kenneth and Laura Lucas of Soldotna, Alaska, Jan Salonen of Pahrump, and Craig and Nilda Lucas of Odessa, Texas.<br>
Bobbie and Gary, being the eldest of both families, were always lending a helping hand to their younger siblings, treating them as their own. Garyʼs work as an electrical lineman led them to live in many places, one of which was Waitsburg, Wash., for many years.<br>

Teddie M. (Banka) Huggins, 53 <br>
   Teddie M. (Banka) Huggins, 53 went to be with the Lord on April 11, 2007 at<br>
Deaconess Medical Center after a long extensive battle with Cancer. She was born<br>
in Sandpoint, Idaho on June 10, 1953 to Robert and Odessa Banka. She lived in<br>
Sandpoint most of her childhood. That is where she met her soul mate Wally<br>
Huggins. They had moved to Whitefish, Mont., with their daughter, Randi where<br>
they lived for a few years and had a son, Shane in 1970. <br>
   Later the family moved to Alaska where they worked and lived, off and on for<br>
several years. In 1977, the longing to have a place to come home to became a<br>
necessity, and they purchased the property in Moyie Springs. Lots of sweat and<br>
tears went into that place Teddie loved so much. She and Wally worked long hours<br>
to completely develop the property for a home site by bringing in water, power<br>
and a road.<br>
   Teddie worked many different jobs. She drove a pilot car, worked as a teller<br>
and loan officer in a couple of different banks and was a ticket agent for an<br>
airline. Her most accomplished and satisfying work that she did was work as a<br>
case worker with the Department of Health and Welfare in Bonners Ferry, Idaho.<br>
Teddie touched many peoples lives with her compassion for their situation and<br>
fairness that made her a success in this field. Teddie never longed much for<br>
material things she always said a home is where you can hang your hat. She was<br>
just happy as long as we were healthy and had each other. She loved hunting,<br>
fishing, picking huckleberries, and long drives around her favorite mountain,<br>
Queen Mtn. Teddie made many accomplishments in her life, but one that she was so<br>
proud of was when she was drawn for a moose permit and shot her bull moose in 1992.<br>
   Teddie is preceded in death by her father, Robert Banka, mother Odessa<br>
Dawson, step-father Emmett Dawson, brother In-law Gary Lucas and an infant son.<br>
Left to remember Teddie are her loving husband Wally; son Shane (Tawnya)<br>
Huggins; daughter Randi Flory (Rob), all of Bonners Ferry, Idaho. Teddie was<br>
very proud of her five grandchildren, Nicholas and Britany Huggins, Tyler,<br>
Krystal and Colton Flory, all of Bonners Ferry, Idaho. Teddie also has five<br>
sisters and two brothers: Bobbie Lucas, Linda (Ron) Collison of Sandpoint,<br>
Idaho; Judy (Paul) Lucas of Soldotna, Alaska; Kay (Coy) Kraatz of Junction City,<br>
Ore; Marion Strandy of Airways Heights, Wash.; Edward (Wilma) Banka of Okinawa,<br>
Japan; and Ron (Debi) Banka of Spokane, Wash.<br>
   Our family will miss her dearly. She was a wonderful daughter, sister, wife,<br>
mother and friend. We feel very blessed by having her the short time we did, but<br>
are grateful for her strong belief in the Lord, and we have peace knowing He is<br>
taking care of her until we meet again.<br>
