<h2>Notes</h2>
Robert FitzPicot DE SAY
<p>
<a name ="I016299"><b>[I016299]</b></a><br />
King William sought aggressive types for the office of sheriff whose ambitions were consistant with his. Those willing to squeeze the peasants to their maximum were the best qualified in William's eyes. He instituted the practice of selling the office to the highest bidder. This brought forth evil men willing to pay exorbitant prices for the office and then willing to do whatever it took to recoup their investment ... No one spoke out for the peaseantry because their only representative to the king was the very sheriffs embezzling them. The most notorious was Picot, Sheriff of Cambridgeshire ... Monks describe him as<br>
    "a hungry lion, a prowling wolf, a crafty fox, a filthy swine, a dog without shame, show stuffed his belly like an insatiable beast as though the who country were a single corpse."<br>

Theodelinde DE SENS
<p>
<a name ="I095773"><b>[I095773]</b></a><br />
Theodelinde was the concubine of Louis I.<br>
</p>
Chilperic I DE SOISSONS
<p>
<a name ="I010065"><b>[I010065]</b></a><br />
Chilpéric I of Neustria was born c.539 and died in September of 584. He was one of the sons of Clotaire I, a king of the Franks.<br>
<br>
Immediately after the death of his father in 561 he endeavoured to take possession of the whole kingdom, seized the treasure amassed in the royal town of Berny and entered Paris. His brothers, however, compelled him to divide the kingdom with them, and Soissons, together with Amiens, Arras, Cambrai, Thérouanne, Tournai and Boulogne fell to Chilperic's share, but on the death of Charibert in 567 his estates were augmented.<br>
<br>
When his brother Sigebert I married Brunhilda, Chilperic also wished to make a brilliant marriage. He had already repudiated his first wife, Audovera, and had taken as his concubine a serving-woman called Fredegund. He accordingly dismissed Fredegond, and married Brunhilda's sister, Galswintha. But he soon tired of his new partner, and one morning Galswintha was found strangled in her bed. A few days afterwards Chilperic married Fredegund.<br>
<br>
This murder was the cause of long and bloody wars, interspersed with truces, between Chilperic and Sigebert. In 575 Sigebert was assassinated by Fredegond at the very moment when he had Chilperic at his mercy. Chilperic retrieved his position, took from Austrasia Tours and Poitiers and some places in Aquitaine, and fostered discord in the kingdom of the east during the minority of Childebert II. One day, however, while returning from the chase to the town of Chelles, Chilperic was stabbed to death.<br>
<br>
Chilperic may be regarded as the type of Merovingian sovereigns. He was exceedingly anxious to extend the royal authority. He levied numerous imposts, and his fiscal measures provoked a great sedition at Limoges in 579. He wished to bring about the subjection of the church, and to this end sold bishoprics to the highest bidder, annulled the wills made in favour of the bishoprics and abbeys, and sought to impose upon his subjects a rationalistic conception of the Trinity.<br>
<br>
He pretended to some literary culture, and was the author of some halting verse. He even added letters to the Latin alphabet, and wished to have the manuscripts rewritten with the new characters. The wresting of Tours from Austrasia and the seizure of ecclesiastical property provoked the bitter hatred of Gregory of Tours, by whom Chilperic was stigmatized as the Nero and the Herod of his time.<br>
<br>
Chilpéric I died in September of 584 at Chelles, Île-de-France, France.<br>

[Burke's Peerage]<br>
<br>
----------------------<br>
<br>
RICHARD TALBOT son and heir, was born about 1250. On 26 July 1276 he was granted protection, as going to Navarre with Edmund the King's brother. On 30 March 1281 he was licensed to hunt and take with his own hands fox, cat, hare and wolf throughout the King's forest of Dean. In 1297 and 1298 he was thrice summoned to serve against the Scots. On 14 July 1297 he was appointed to the custody of the castle and town of Cardiff; on 30 July, to assess and collect a one-eighth and one-fifth of movables in Staffs; and on 23 October 1299 he was in a commission in Gloucestershlre; Sheriff of Gloucestershire, October 1299-October 1301. His seal was appended to the Barons' letter to the Pope, as on 12 February 1300/1, as Richard Talbot Lord of Eccleswall. On 12 May 1301 he was directed to select 700 footmen in Gloucestershire and the Forest of Dean, and conduct them to Berwick-on-Tweed; and on 21 November to select 500 and conduct them to Linlithgow. On 18 December 1301 he had letters of credence to expound to the knights, men and community in co. Gloucester the need of their aiding the King and his army in Scotland with 500 quarters of wheat; and on 1 March 1305/6 he was required to provide wheat and wine from co.

Worcester, by ISABEL, sister and heir of William (MAUDUIT), EARL OF WARWICK, daughter of William MAUDUIT, of Hanslope, Bucks. He died shortly before 3 September 1306. Sarah Talbot, probably his widow, was living, July 1317. [Complete Peerage XII/1:609-10, (transcribed by Dave Utzinger)]<br>

Robert DE TOENI
<p>
<a name ="I004939"><b>[I004939]</b></a><br />
Amongst the most distinguished companion in arms of the Conqueror was Robert de Todeni, a nobleman of Normandy, upon whom the victorious monarch conferred, with numerous other grants, an estate in the county of Lincoln upon the borders of Leicestershire. Here de Todeni erected a stately castle and, from the fair view it commanded, gave it the designation of Belvoir Castle, and here he established his chief abode. At the time of the General Survey, this powerful personage possessed no less than eighty extensive lordships, viz., two in Yorkshire, one in Essex, four in Suffolk, one in Cambridge, two in Hertfordshire, three in Bucks, four in Gloucestershire, three in Bedfordshire, nine in Northamptonshire, two in Rutland, thirty-two in Lincolnshire, and seventeen in Leicestershire. "of this Robert," saith Dugdale, "I have not seen any other memorial than that the Coucher-Book of Belvoir recordeth: which is, that bearing a venerable esteem to our sometime much celebrated protomartyr, St. Alban, he founded near to his castle a priory for monks and annexed it as a cell to that great abbey in Hertfordshire, formerly erected by the devout King Offa in honour of that most holy man." Robert de Todeni, Lord of Belvoir, d. in 1088, leaving issue by his wife Adela, William, who assumed the surname of Albini; Berenger; Geoffrey; Robert; and Agnes. He was s. by his eldest son, William de Albini, Brito, Lord of Belvoir. [Sir Bernard Burke, Dormant, Abeyant, Forfeited and Extinct Peerages, Burke's Peerage, Ltd., London, England, 1883, p. 160, Daubeney, Barons Daubeney, Earl of Bridgewater]<br>
</p>
Roger DE TOENI
<p>
<a name ="I009270"><b>[I009270]</b></a><br />
ROGER DE TOENI III, styled also DE CONCHES, 1st son and hei r, was born probably about 1104, and succeeded his father about 1126. In 1131 he attested Henry I's pan-carte confirming all the grants of his ancestors and himself and others t o the abbey of Conches. He is said to have waged war with Hugh de Chateauneuf in 1133. In 1135 the King suspected that he was preparing to rebel, together with William Talvas, Count of Ponthieu, on behalf of Henry's son-in-law, Geoffrey Plantagenet, and sent his own soldiers to garrison the castle of Conches. After the King's death, Roger supported Geoffrey and his wife the Empress Maud against Stephen. After Easter 1136 hostilities began between him and the King's generals, the twins Waleran, Count of Meulan, and Robert, Earl of Leicester; and civil war raged in May and June. In the autumn the fighting flared up again; but on 3 October Roger was ambushed and captured by Count Waleran and Henry de la Pommeraye. His land was laid under an interdict and he was kept in prison for more than 6 months, but was released in 1137 . In May1138 he was attacked by the Count of Meulan and William d'Ypres, but defended himself successfully; and on 7 September he captured Breteuil and burnt the town. However, be fore the end of 1138 he made peace with the twin Earls, who conducted him to England, where he was reconciled to King Stephen. Nothing is known of what happened to his English lands during this period. In 1150 or 1151 he was with Henry, Duke of Normandy, at Rouen. After Henry had become King, Roger enjoyed the royal favor; for between Michaelmas 1157and Michaelmas 1158 the King granted him 100 solidates of l and at Holkham, Norfolk. He was a benefactor to the abbeys of la Noë, Conches and Bec.<br>
<br>
He married Ida, daughter of BALDWIN III, COUNT OF HAINAULT , by Yolande, daughter of Gerard, COUNT OF GUELDERS. With he r he had in marriage from Henry 120 librates of land out of t he royal demesne at East Bergholt, Suffolk. He died after Michaelmas 1157 and probably before 1162.[Complete Peerage XI I/1:763-4, (transcribed by Dave Utzinger)]<br>
</p>
Roger DE TOENI
<p>
<a name ="I009262"><b>[I009262]</b></a><br />
He came of age in 1256 and received his lands, including Maud Castle (aka Paincastle), which was being held for him by HUMPHREY DE BOHUN, EARL OF HEREFORD & ESSEX (RIN 3637), his father-in-law. He joined with<br>
HUMPHREY in defense of the Welsh marches between Montgomery and Gloucester. While there, he was with the future KING EDWARD I (RIN 728). In 1262 he was summoned for action against Llewelyn II<br>
(RIN 3517*) in Hereford. He is said to have supported KING HENRY III in the baron's war, but was dead before the Battle of Lewes (14 May 1264).<br>
From the "Homer Beers James Genealogy" on the www: "Ralph de Toni [sic. - should be ROGER V] married Alice Bohun, daughter of Humphrey de Bohun and his wife, Maud of Eu. . . Robert de Toni [son of Roger V] d.s.p. in 1311, and his estates devolved upon his sister, Alice de Toni."<br>
</p>
Roger II DE TOENI
<p>
<a name ="I009299"><b>[I009299]</b></a><br />
Roger de Toeni, also called Roger de Conches; fought Muslims in Spain; married 1st? Stephanie (m. 2nd Garsias, King of Spain) sister of Raymond Berenger, Count of Barcelona; married 2nd? Godeheut (m. 2nd Richard, 3rd Count of Evereux), and died 1038 or 1039 in battle against a neighboring noble whose territory he had overrun in a revolt against the succession of William I the Conqueror to his father's Norman possessions on the grounds that William was illegitimate. [Burke's Peerage]<br>
<br>
Note: According to Burke's, Roger married two different women as 1st husband, both married later husbands. There is no explanation given. Did the first marriage end in divorce? Or was one of the marriages, perhaps the 1st one, a "handshake" marriage not officially recorded?<br>

Renhard I DE TONNERRE
<p>
<a name ="I010250"><b>[I010250]</b></a><br />
This is an excerpt from a post to SGM (full post is in notes under Ermengarde de Tonnerre), 5 Dec 1998, by Settipani, the noted French genealogist:<br>
<br>
The Ascendancy of Ermengarde of Tonnerre : Part II<br>
<br>
Renard (no 32) is not attested as member of the family. He is named as a count in a trial about Tonnerrois and fit at the good place for the missing generation in the family (to justify Renard IIʼs name, wich was no more inherited from a pseudo ʻBar-sur-Seineʼ dynasty, and because Milo IIʼs daughter was a Ren-trude).<br>
</p>
Guillaume IV DE TOULOUSE
<p>
<a name ="I007467"><b>[I007467]</b></a><br />
William IV of Toulouse (c. 1040-1094). Count of Toulouse from 1061-1094. Also Marquess of Provence and Duke of Narbonne. He succeeded his father Pons of Toulouse upon his death in 1061. His mother was Almodis de la Marche, but she was kidnapped by and subsequently married to Ramon Berenguer I, Count of Barcelona when William was a boy. He was married to Emma of Montain, who gave him one daughter. He also had an illegitimate son, William-Jordan, with his half sister Adelaide.<br>
<br>
He went on a pilgrimage to the Holy Land in 1088, shortly before the First Crusade, leaving his brother Raymond as regent. He was killed six years later in Spain at the Battle of Huesca.<br>
<br>
His daughter by Emma of Montain, Philippa, was married to William IX of Aquitaine. It was his intention that she take his lands and title upon his death, but in her absence Raymond usurped the county.<br>
</p>
William DE TRACY
<p>
<a name ="I020692"><b>[I020692]</b></a><br />
Sir William de Tracy, Knt., (died c. 1189) was Lord of the Manor of Toddington, Gloucestershire, feudal Baron of Bradninch, near Exeter, and Lord of Moretonhampstead, Devon.  He is notorious as one of the four knights who assassinated the Archbishop of Canterbury Thomas Becket in December 1170.<br>
His family:<br>
John de Sudeley, son of Harold de Mantes, married Grace de Tracey, daughter and heiress of Henri de Tracey, feudal lord of Barnstaple in Devonshire. They had two children: Ralph, who became the heir of his father, and William. Sir William de Tracey inherited the lands of his mother and assumed her family name, becoming a knight of Gloucestershire, Sir William de Tracey, and holding the lands of his brother by one knight's fee. He married Hawise de Born and had one son, Sir Henry de Tracey (Henry the Hunchback), and two daughters.<br>
He also appears in a charter of his older brother Ralph de Sudeley (d. 1192) assigning the manor of Yanworth, near Cirencester, to the monks of Gloucester Abbey. Two of the witnesses to that charter lived on property owned by the Normandy branch of the de Tracys, and two of the English witnesses witnessed a previous charter for Henry de Tracy to Barnstaple Priory in 1146. In 1166 William held one feu of his brother, Ralph.<br>
William de Tracy made charitable benefactions in France, building and endowing a house for lepers at a place called Coismas (Commeaux ?). In addition he made gifts to the Priory of St. Stephen, Le Plessis-Grimoult, lands possessed by the family before all finally came to England.<br>

</p>
William DE VALENCE
<p>
<a name ="I008921"><b>[I008921]</b></a><br />
From Wikipedia<br>
<br>
William de Valence, 1st Earl of Pembroke (d. May 16, 1296) was a French nobleman, who became important in English politics due to his relationship to Henry III.<br>
<br>
He was the fourth son of Isabella of Angouleme, widow of king John of England, and her second husband, Hugh X of Lusignan, count of La Marche, and was thus a half-brother to Henry III of England, and uncle to Edward I of England.<br>
<br>
The French conquest of Poitou in 1246 created great difficulties for William's family, and so he and several of his brother's accepted Henry III's invitation to come to England in 1247. The king found important positions for all of them; William was soon married to a great heiress, Joan de Munchesni, only surviving child of Warin de Muchensi and Joan, daughter and eventual co-heiress of William Marshal, 4th Earl of Pembroke. Her portion of the Marshal estates included the castle and lordship of Pembroke and the lordship of Wexford in Ireland.<br>
<br>
This favoritism to royal relatives was one of the matters that set off the Barons' War, and in 1258 William was driven out of England. He returned 3 years later after Henry III repudiated the Provisions of Oxford, and fought on the royalist side at the Battle of Lewes. After the battle he fled to Pembroke, where he raised forces that led to the final defeat of the barons at the Battle of Evesham.<br>
<br>
In his later years William accompanied his nephew Edward (later Edward I) on pilgrimage to the Holy Land, and from his base in Pembrokeshire was a mainstay of the English fights against the Welsh princes.<br>
<br>
Though he is sometimes called earl in contemporary documents, it is uncertain when if ever William was formally created or recognized as Earl of Pembroke.<br>
<br>
William and Joan de Muchesni (described above) had three children:<br>
    * Aymer de Valence, 2nd Earl of Pembroke<br>
    * Isabel, who married John, 1st Lord Hastings. Their grandson Lawrence later became earl of Pembroke<br>
    * Joan, who married John Comyn<br>
</p>

    * Catherine of Valois (b. 1299, died young).<br>
<br>
In 1302 he remarried to Catherine I of Courtenay (1274 - 1308), titular Empress of Constantinople. They had four children:<br>
    * Catherine de Valois-Courtenay, titular Empress of Constantinople (1301-1346). She married Philip I d'Anjou, Prince of Taranto and had issue.<br>

    * Jean, Count of Chartres (1303-1308).<br>
