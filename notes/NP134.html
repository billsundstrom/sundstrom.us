Ranulf DE POITIERS
<p>
<a name ="I007643"><b>[I007643]</b></a><br />
Ranulf II of Poitiers (850-August 5, 890) was Count of Poitiers between 866 and 890. Ranulf became Duke of Aquitaine in 887 and styled himself king of Aquitaine from 888 to his death. Ranulf was son of Ranulf I of Poitiers and Bilichilde of Maine. He married an Ermengarde and by her had a son, Ranulf III, that succeeded him as count of Poitiers. His illegitimate son Ebalus succeeded him in Aquitaine and, in the death of Ranulf III, in Poitiers too.<br>
</p>
Ranulf I DE POITIERS
<p>
<a name ="I007645"><b>[I007645]</b></a><br />
Ranulf I of Poitiers (died 866) was a Count of Poitiers and Duke of Aquitaine.<br>
<br>
He is considered a possible son of Gerard, Count of Auvergne and Hildegard / Matilda, daughter of Louis the Pious and Ermengarde.<br>
<br>
Although not much is known about Ranulf I, he died in 866 in Aquitaine, France.<br>
<br>
His son, Ranulf II of Poitiers, then inherited Poitiers and later acquired Aquitaine. Through the duchy of Aquitaine, he is the ancestor of Eleanor of Aquitaine, thus he is also an ancestor of the present-day British Royal Family.<br>

Guillaume VIII DE POITOU
<p>
<a name ="I007464"><b>[I007464]</b></a><br />
From Wikipedia<br>
<br>
William VIII of Aquitaine, (Guillaume VIII in French) (1025 - September 25, 1086), whose name was Guy-Geoffroy before becoming duke of Aquitaine, was Duke of Gascony (1052-1086), and then Duke of Aquitaine and Count of Poitiers (as William VI of Poitiers) between 1058 and 1086, succceeding his brother William VII (Pierre-Guillaume). Guy-Geoffroy was the youngest son of William V of Aquitaine by his third wife Agnes of Burgundy. He was the brother-in-law of Henry III, Holy Roman Emperor who had married his sister, Agnes de Poitiers.<br>
<br>
He became Duke of Gascony in 1052 during his older brother William VII's rule. Gascony had come to Aquitanian rule through William V's marriage to Prisca (a.k.a Brisce) of Gascony, the sister of Duke Sans VI Guilhem of Gascony.<br>
<br>
William VIII was one of the leaders of the allied army called to help Ramiro I of Aragon in the siege of Barbastro (1064). This expedition was the first campaign organized by the papacy, namely Pope Alexander II, against a Muslim city, and the precursor of the later Crusades movement. Aragon and its allies conquered the city, killed its inhabitants and collected an important booty. However, Aragon lost the city again in the following years. During William VIII's rule, the alliance with the southern kingdoms of modern Spain was a political priority as shown by the marriage of all his daughters to Iberian kings.<br>
<br>
He married three times and had at least five children. After he divorced his second wife due to infertility, he remarried to a much younger woman who was also his cousin. This marriage produced a son, but William VIII had to visit Rome in the early 1070s to persuade the pope to recognize his children from his third marriage as legitimate.<br>
<br>
* First wife: Garsende of Périgord, daughter of Count Aldabert II of Périgord and his wife Alausie, herself the second daughter of duke Sans VI Guilhem of Gascony (divorced November 1058), no children. She became a nun at Saintes.<br>
<br>
* Second wife: Matoeda (divorced May 1068)<br>
   1. Agnes (1052-1078), married Alfonso VI of Castile<br>
<br>
<br>
* Third wife: Hildegarde of Burgundy (daughter of duke Robert I of Burgundy)<br>
   1. Agnes (d.1097), married Peter I of Aragon<br>
   2. William IX of Aquitaine, his heir<br>

Enguerrand I DE PONTHIEU
<p>
<a name ="I005046"><b>[I005046]</b></a><br />
Note: In terms of the death date (25 Oct 1053) at the siege of Arques, I think Curt is referring to Enguerrand II, d. 1053 at the siege of Arque, whom I have as the grandson. Maybe the grandson is the Enguerrand who m. Adele in 1333/4, as his 1st wife, before marrying Adelaid, sister of William I.<br>
<br>
Note: Curt's source must have Adele marrying Enguerrand as her 2nd husband, and not as her 1st, as I show it. This may be true, but their supposed son Hugh must have been born well before 1033/4 (probably around 1000) because Hugh (Adele & Enguerrand's son) d. 20 Nov 1052. He would have been born in 1333/4 and be 18 or 19 years old, possible however unlikely. However AR & CP have Hugh's son Enguerrand II, dead at a siege in 1053; this is impossible if his father wasn't born until 1033/4, because he could be at most 6 or 7 years old, assuming his father sired him when only 12 or 13 years old. Enguerrand II married Adelaide, the sister of William the Conqueror and had at least one child before his death, which clearly could not have been at the age of 6 or 7.<br>
<br>
This leaves at least 4 possibilities: (1) Hugh, b. c 997, is not a son of Enguerrand I, maybe his brother; (2) Hugh is the son of Enguerrand by an unknown 1st wife (prior to Adlele); (3) Adele did not marry Enguerrand I, but his grandson Enguerrand II as mentioned above; (4) Curt's or my sources are incorrect (I think least likely of the 4 possibilities). I will use possibility (2) until I can get more information about which of the 4 possibilities are true.<br>

Henry DE PORT
<p>
<a name ="I016303"><b>[I016303]</b></a><br />
Henry de Port, son and heir, witnessed Henry I's coronation charter in 1100. He was sheriff of Hants at some time between 1101 and 1106, and up to 1115 was in frequent attendance at the King's court. In 1108 he gave a rent to Rochester cathedral priory with the consent of his wife Hawise and his son Hugh, and subsequently he founded the priory of Sherborne as a cell of the abbey of St Vigor-de-Cerisy (-Ia-Foret), the charter being witnessed by his wife Hawise and his sons William and John. In or shortly before 1130 he was a justice in eyre in Kent. The Bayeux Inquest of 1133 shows him holding 3 kinghts' fees in Normandy of the Bishop of Bayeux. Henry was a benefactor of Montacute Priory, Smerset, and his wife Hawise gave 5 hides in West Shefford, Berks, to Shereborne, and 3 virgates in Farley, Wilts, to the Templars. The date of his death is unknown, His wife Hawise survived him. [ Complete Peerage XI:318, (transcribed by Dave Utzinger)]<br>

<br>
He became Count de Vendôme with death of his brother-in-law Bouchard III. He takes share with the conflict which opposed the two brothers of Anjou, Geoffroy III the Bearded one and Foulque IV Réchin. Supporting Fulk initially, he switched sides and was imprisoned by Lancelin de Beaugency and then ransomed in 1090. Like his predecessors, he feuded with the Abbey of the Trinity, a conflict that causes his excommunication. In penance, he took part in the first Crusade.

Jean I DE PREUILLY
<p>
<a name ="I015476"><b>[I015476]</b></a><br />
From Wikipedia:<br>
<br>
Jean Ier of Preuilly (1110 ? 1182) Count de Vendôme (1145-1182), son of Geoffroy III Grisegonel and Mathilde de Châteaudun. He governed their estates after the departure of his father in crusades in 1137.  He became the count when died during his return from the Holy Land.<br>

But the resistance of the Count Jean I and his sons Bouchard and Lancelin defeated the Count of Blois. The Count of Anjou was obliged to restore their power. In 1170, Vendôme is where the kings of France and England met and negotiated a truce.<br>
In 1173, Henri II fought with his sons. This conflict broke up the family of Vendôme, because Jean I supported the father, and Bouchard supported the princes. Bouchard occupied by force the castle and barred the city gates to his father. But the young English princes were beaten and Bouchard had to submit to his father.<br>
The old conflict with the abbey of the Trinity reemerged in 1176. He drove the monks out and they took refuge in Angers. Excommunicated, he was forced to fight in the Holy Land. On his return he died, in 1182 at the Charity-on-Loire.<br>

Boso DE PROVENCE
<p>
<a name ="I005429"><b>[I005429]</b></a><br />
From Wikipedia<br>
<br>
Boso was a Frankish noblemen, related to the Carolingian dynasty, and rose to be King of Provence.<br>
<br>
Boso was the son of Biwin, a count in Lotharingia. His aunt Theutberga was the wife of the Emperor Lothar II. Boso also was a nephew of the Italian count Boso, from which Boso derived his name, and of Hugbert, lay abbot of St. Maurice dʼAgaune, which he succeeded as lay abbot in 869.<br>
<br>
In 870 Charles the Bald, King of Western Francia, married Boso's sister Richilde. This marriage paved the way for Boso's career in the service of his royal brother-in-law. In the same year, Bosos was appointed count of Lyons and Vienne, replacing Gerard of Rousillon, and in 872 Charles appointed him chamberlain and magister ostiariorum to Charles' young son Louis the Stammerer and also count of Bourges. Louis ruled as a subordinate king of Aquitaine, but because of his youth, it was Boso who took care of the administration of that realm.<br>
<br>
In autumn of 875 he accompanied Charles on his first Italian campaign and at the diet of Pavia in February 876 he was appointed arch-minister and missus for Italy and elevated to the honour of a duke. He probably had also been charged with the administration of the Provence. Boso acted as a viceroy and increased his prestige even more by marrying Ermengarde, the only daughter of Emperor Louis II.<br>
<br>
He however disapproved of Charles' second Italian campaign in 877 and and conspired with other, like-minded nobles against his king. After Charles's death in October 877 these nobles forced Charles's son Louis the Stammerer to confirm their rights and privileges.<br>
<br>
Boso also formed close relations to the Papacy and in September 878 he accompanied Pope John VIII to Troyes, where the Pope asked king Louis the Stammerer for his support in Italy. The Pope adopted Boso as his son and probably offered to crown Louis Emperor.<br>
<br>
In April 879 king Louis the Stammerer died, leaving behind two adult sons, Louis and Carloman. Boso joined with other western Frankish nobles and advocated making Louis the sole heir of the western kingdom, but eventually both brothers were elected kings.<br>
<br>
Boso, claiming reasons of legitimacy, however renounced allegiance to both brothers and in July claimed independence ("Boso Dei gratia id quod sum"). He also claimed that his father-in-law Louis II had named him as his heir. On 15 October, 879 the bishops and nobles of the region around the rivers Rhone and Saone assembled at Mantaille elected Boso king as successor to Louis the Stammerer. This event marks the first occurence of a "free election", without regard to royal descent, inspired by principles of ecclesiastical elections.<br>
<br>
Boso's realm, usually called Kingdom of Provence comprised the church province Arles, Aix, Vienne, Lyons (without Langres), probably Besancon, as well as the dioceses Tarentaise, Uzes und Viviers.<br>
<br>
After Louis and Carloman had divided their father's realm at Amiens in March 880, the two brothers marched against Boso, took Macon and the northern parts of Boso's realm. They united their forces with those of Charles the Fat and unsuccesfully besieged Vienne from August to November.<br>
<br>
In August 882 Boso was again besieged at Vienne by his relative Richard, Count of Autun, who took the city in September.<br>
<br>
After this, Boso could not regain most of his realm and was restricted to the vicinity of Vienne.<br>
<br>
He died in 887 and was succeeded by his son Louis.<br>

Boso DE PROVENCE
<p>
<a name ="I004845"><b>[I004845]</b></a><br />
Count of Provence at Arles 949 & at Avignon 935; son of Rotbauds, A Burgundian Seigneur, and a dau of Boso II, Count of Arles & Avignon; m. Constance of Vienne; father of William I, Count of Provence at Arles; d. 965/7. [Charlemagne & Others, Chart 3318, 3332]<br>
---------------------------------<br>
Boson II of Arles (928 - 965/67) was Count of Avignon from 935 and Count of Arles from 949. Around 953, Boso II married Constance of Provence, a daughter of the Buviniden Karl Konstantin, Count of Vienna, from which he got two sons: Redwood II (Roubaud), and William I (Guillaume the Liberator) (* c. 952;  994), Count of Arles and Provence, and then Margrave of Provence.[1] His origin is controversial, even though his life is relatively well known.[2][3][4]<br>
Origin<br>
According to a first hypothesis, Boson II, son of Rotbold (Roubaud) or Roadboald of Agel, a Mâconnais noble is given the title of Count of Provence in 903 by Louis the Blind.<br>
The ancestors of Rotbold are unknown. Some historians consider that it could be the husband of either a daughter of William I or Ermengarde, one of the daughters of Boso of Provence. This hypothesis is based on the fact that his ancestor being a male descendant of the Margrave Boso is rejected by some historians due to this Boso only having female descendants.<br>
According to the French historian Jean-Pierre Poly, who sides with this hypothesis, the family holding the county who was put into power by Hugh of Italy, probably came from Septimania, their most important member, Boson, switched sides around 947-948 by cancelling his marriage with Berthe, the niece of Hugh, and marrying a noblewoman named Constance, considered by some as Constance de Provence, who gave her name to her grand-daughter Constance of Arles, queen of Robert II of France. His brother Guilhem gave his name to one of Boson's sons and makes him possibly related to the Guilhelmides of Auvergne. Conrad I of Burgundy, the new king of Provence may have found in Boson a less threathening and ambitious count from a minor family, and more likely to go along with Provencal dignitaries<br>

Eleonore DE PROVENCE
<p>
<a name ="I007450"><b>[I007450]</b></a><br />
From Wikipedia<br>
<br>
Eleanor of Provence (c 1223 - 26 June 1291) was Queen Consort of King Henry III of England.<br>
<br>
Born in Aix-en-Provence, she was the daughter of Ramon Berenguer IV, Count of Provence (1198-1245) and Beatrice of Savoy (1206-1266), the daughter of Tomasso, Count of Savoy and his second wife Marguerite of Geneva. All four of their daughters became queens. Like her mother, grandmother, and sisters, Eleanor was renowned for her beauty. Eleanor was probably born in 1223; Matthew Paris describes her as being "jamque duodennem" (presently twelve) when she arrived in England for her marriage.<br>
<br>
Eleanor was married to Henry III, King of England (1207-1272) on January 14, 1236. She had never seen him prior to the wedding at Canterbury Cathedral and had never set foot in his impoverished kingdom. Edmund Rich, Archbishop of Canterbury, officiated. Eleanor and Henry had five children:<br>
   1. Edward I (1239-1307)<br>
   2. Margaret (born 1240), married King Alexander III of Scotland<br>
   3. Beatrice (born 1242), married John II, Duke of Brittany<br>
   4. Edmund Crouchback (born 1245)<br>
   5. Katharine (born 1253-May 3, 1257)<br>
<br>
Eleanor seems to have been especially devoted to her eldest son, Edward; when he was deathly ill in 1246, she stayed with him at the abbey at Beaulieu for three weeks, long past the time allowed by monastic rules. It was due to her influence that King Henry granted the duchy of Gascony to Edward in 1249. Her youngest child, Katharine, seems to have had a degenerative disease that rendered her mute. When she died aged four, both her royal parents suffered overwhelming grief.<br>
<br>
She was a confident consort to Henry, but she brought in her retinue a large number of cousins, "the Savoyards," and her influence with the King and her unpopularity with the English barons created friction during Henry's reign. Eleanor was devoted to her husband's cause, stoutly contested Simon de Montfort, raising troops in France for Henry's cause. On July 13, 1263, she was sailing down the Thames on a barge when her barge was attacked by citizens of London. In fear for her life, Eleanor was rescued by Thomas FitzThomas, the mayor of London, and took refuge at the bishop of London's home.<br>
<br>
In 1272 Henry died, and her son Edward, 33 years old, became Edward I, King of England. She stayed on in England as Dowager Queen, and raised several of her grandchildren -- Edward's son Henry and daughter Eleanor, and Beatrice's son John. When her grandson Henry died in her care in 1274, Eleanor mourned him and his heart was buried at the priory at Guildford she founded in his memory. Eleanor retired to a convent but remained in touch with her son and her sister, Marguerite.<br>
<br>
Eleanor died in 1291 in Amesbury, England.<br>
</p>
Guillaume II DE PROVENCE
<p>
<a name ="I004843"><b>[I004843]</b></a><br />
William I (c. 950 - after 29 August 993), called the Liberator, was Count of Provence from 968 to his abdication. In 975 or 979, he took the title of marchio or margrave. He is often considered the founder of the county of Provence. He and his elder brother Rotbold I were sons of Boson II of Arles and his wife Constance, who, based on her name, has been speculated to be daughter of Charles Constantine of Vienne. They both carried the title of comes or count concurrently, but it is unknown if they were joint-counts of the whole of Provence or if the region was divided. His brother never bore any other title than count so long as William lived, so the latter seems to have attained a certain supremacy.<br>
In 980, he was installed as Count of Arles. His sobriquet comes from his victories against the Saracens by which he liberated Provence from their threat, which had been constant since the establishment of a base at Fraxinet. At the Battle of Tourtour in 973, with the assistance of the counts of the High Alps and the viscounts of Marseille and Fos, he definitively routed the Saracens, chasing them forever from Provence. He reorganised the region east of the Rhône, which he conquered from the Saracens and which had been given him as a gift from King Conrad of Burgundy. Also by royal consent, he and his descendants controlled the fisc in Provence. With Isarn, Bishop of Grenoble, he repopulated Dauphiné and settled an Italian count named Ugo Blavia near Fréjus in 970 in order to bring that land back to cultivation. For all this, he figures prominently in Ralph Glaber's chronicle with the title of dux and he appears in a charter of 992 as pater patriae.<br>
He donated land to Cluny and retired to become a monk, dying at Avignon, where he was buried in the church of Saint-Croix at Sarrians. He was succeeded as margrave by his brother. His great principality began to diminish soon after his death as the castles of his vassals, which he had kept carefully under ducal control, soon became allods of their possessors.<br>
Marriage and issue<br>
He married 1st Arsenda, daughter of Arnold of Comminges[1] and they had no children.<br>
He married 2nd (against papal advice) in 984, Adelaide-Blanche of Anjou, daughter of Fulk II of Anjou and Gerberga, and their children were:<br>
Constance of Arles (986-1034), married Robert II of France.[1]<br>
William II (or III) of Provence.[1]<br>
</p>
Raymond Berenger IV DE PROVENCE
<p>
<a name ="I007511"><b>[I007511]</b></a><br />
Ramon Berenguer IV, Count of Provence (1195 - 19 August 1245), Count of Provence and Forcalquier, was the son of Alfonso II, Count of Provence and Gersenda II of Sabran. After his father's death, Ramon was imprisoned in a castle in Aragon until he was able to escape in 1219 and claim his inheritance. He was a powerful and energetic ruler who added Forcalquier to his domain.<br>
<br>
Ramon married (5 June 1219) Beatrice of Savoy (d. 1266), daughter of Thomas I of Savoy. She was a shrewd and politically astute woman, who's beauty was liked by Matthew Paris to that of a second Niobe. Ramon and Beatrice of Savoy had four beautiful daughters, who all married kings.<br>
   1. Two sons, possibly twins, who died young<br>
   2. Marguerite of Provence (born 1231), wife of Louis IX of France<br>
   3. Eleanor of Provence (born 1233), wife of Henry III of England<br>
   4. Sanchia of Provence (born 1228), wife of Richard, Earl of Cornwall<br>
   5. Beatrice of Provence (born 1231), wife of Charles I of Sicily<br>
</p>
Sanchia DE PROVENCE
<p>
<a name ="I095513"><b>[I095513]</b></a><br />
French and English Nobility. Countess of Cornwall, Queen of the Romans. The third daughter of Raymond Berenger V, Count of Provence and his wife Beatrice of Savoy, Sanchia was the younger sister of Marguerite, Queen of France, and Eleanor, Queen of England. It was her sister Eleanor who arranged for the marriage of Sanchia and her brother-in-law Richard, Earl of Cornwall. The marriage took place on November 23, 1243 at Westminster Abbey. Richard was a 35 year old widower, Sanchia was 18. Their only child to survive to adulthood was Edmund, born in 1249. In 1257, she was crowned Queen of the Romans and Queen of Germany with her husband in Aachen, Germany. Their rule was in name only however, and the titles held little significance. Unlike her sisters, Sanchia was quiet, unambitious, and very pious. She was a devoted mother who strove to meet her husband's expectations, sacrificing herself to do so. She fell short, and by 1250, Sanchia had been all but abandoned by Richard in favour of business and politics. During the long illness before her death, Richard visited her only once, and left promptly the next day. He ordered that the executors of her will begin giving away her assets 8 days before she died, and did not attend her funeral. The nature of her illness is unknown, and she was only 33 years old. Sanchia was buried on November 15 at the abbey she and her husband had dedicated a decade earlier. Her sister, Queen Eleanor was unable to attend, but her uncles Peter, Earl of Richmond, and Boniface, Archbishop of Canterbury, were in attendance.     <br>

Roger DE QUINCY
<p>
<a name ="I005091"><b>[I005091]</b></a><br />
Roger de Quincy, 2nd Earl of Winchester (1195? - April 25, 1265) was an English nobleman.<br>
<br>
He was the second son of Saer de Quincy, 1st Earl of Winchester, and Margaret de Beaumont.<br>
<br>
He probably joined his father on the Fifth Crusade in 1219, where the elder de Quincy fell sick and died. His elder brother having died a few years earlier, Roger thus inherited his father's titles and properties. However, he did not take possession of his father's lands until February 1221, probably because he did not return to England from the crusade until then. He did not formally become earl until after the death of his mother in 1235.<br>
<br>
Roger married Helen, eldest daughter and co-heiress of Alan, Lord of Galloway. After the latter's death in 1234, Galloway was partioned, with Roger and the husbands of his wife's 2 sisters each receiving a third. The Gallwegans rebelled, not wanting their land divided. The rebellion was suppressed by Alexander II of Scotland. Roger ruled his portion of Galloway quite strictly, and the Gallwegans revolted again in 1247, forcing Roger to hole up in a castle. Faced with a siege and little chance of relief, Roger and a few men fought their way out and rode off to seek help from the king, who raised forces to again suppress the rebellion.<br>
<br>
In the following years Roger was one of the leaders of the baronial opposition to Henry III of England.<br>
<br>
Roger had 3 daughters, but no sons. After his death his estates were divided between the daughters, and the earldom of Winchester lapsed.<br>
<br>
Roger married 3 times. His first wife was (as mentioned above) Helen of Galloway, by whom he had the three daughters that became his heiresses. By his last two wives he had no children. The second wife was Maud de Bohun, daughter of Humphrey de Bohun, 2nd Earl of Hereford, and the third wife was Eleanor Ferrers, daughter of William Ferrers, Earl of Derby.<br>
<br>
The three daughters of Roger and Helen of Galloway were:<br>
    * Helen (also known as Ela), who married Alan Baron Zouche of Ashby;<br>
    * Elizabeth (also known as Isabella), who married Alexander Comyn, 2nd Earl of Buchan;<br>
    * Margaret, who married William Ferrers, Earl of Derby (and was thus stepmother to her stepmother).<br>

<p>
<a name ="I005089"><b>[I005089]</b></a><br />
Saer de Quincy, 1st Earl of Winchester (d. November 3, 1219) was one of the leaders of the baronial rebellion against king John of England.<br>
<br>
His name is variously spelled. The first name is sometimes rendered Saher or Seer, and the last name Quency or Quenci.<br>
<br>
His background is a little uncertain. He was probably the son of Robert FitzRichard and nephew of another Saer de Quincy, who was lord of Buckby in Northamptonshire.<br>
<br>
Sometime between 1168 and 1173 de Quincy married Margaret, youngest daughter of Robert de Beaumont, 3rd Earl of Leicester.<br>
<br>
Quincy was one of the barons who took part in the rebellion of Henry the Young King in 1184. Like most of the rebels, he eventually received his lands back after the rebellion failed. He subsequently served as castellan at various castles in the English royal possessions in France. Most notably, in 1203 he was castellan at Vandreuil in Normandy, and surrendered it to the French.<br>
<br>
In 1204 de Quincy's brother-in-law Robert de Beaumont, 4th Earl of Leicester died, leaving de Quincy's wife as co-heiress along with her elder sister. The estate was split in half, and after the final division was ratified in 1207 de Quincy was made earl of Winchester.<br>
<br>
Quincy never got along with king John, and was one of the 25 guarenteors of the Magna Carta. He fought against John in the troubles that followed the signing of the Charter, and against Henry III as well.<br>
<br>
After the failure of the early attempts to depose Henry III, de Quincy decided to fulfill a vow he had made to go on crusade. In 1219 he left to join the Fifth Crusade, then besieging Damietta. There he fell sick and died.<br>
<br>
By his wife Margaret de Beaumont he had three sons and a daughter:<br>
<br>
    * Robert (d. 1217). Some sources say he married Hawise, sister and co-heiress of Ranulf de Blundeville, earl of Chester. However, it is more likely Hawise married Saer's brother Robert;<br>
    * Roger, who succeeded his father as earl of Winchester (though he did not take formal possession of the earldom until after his mother's death);<br>
    * another Robert (d. 1257) who married Helen, daughter of the Welsh prince Llywelyn the Great;<br>
    * Hawise, who married Hugh de Vere, 4th Earl of Oxford.<br>

</p>
Conan I DE RENNES
<p>
<a name ="I005238"><b>[I005238]</b></a><br />
Conan I of Rennes (927 - June 27, 992), was count of Rennes and duke of Brittany, from 990 to his death. He became ruler of Brittany after a period of civil and political unrest, through his father, Judicael Berenguer, count of Rennes and great-grandson of Duke of Brittany. He married Ermengarde of Anjou and had the following issue:<br>
    * Judith (982-1017), married Richard II, Duke of Normandy<br>
    * Judicael, count of Porhoert (died 1037)<br>
    * Geoffrey of Brittany, his heir<br>
Conan died in battle and is buried in Mont St Michel Abbey.<br>

Alan DE RICHMOND
<p>
<a name ="I095147"><b>[I095147]</b></a><br />
The third constable of Richmond Castle who married Olivia de Croft. Records indicate that during the first year of the reign of Richard I (1189) he owed the king 200 marks for the custody of Richmond Castle. In 1193, he paid 10 marks and owed 190. In the second year of the reign of John (1201) he gave the king 300 marks and 3 palfreys (horses) to be the constable of Richmond Castle, and by their service to retain the same title for his heirs. In 1208, he gave King John an additional 200 marks and 4 palfreys to have Richmond Castle, which had been taken from him, and to have the King's letter patent granting him military jurisdiction which he thought the castle should possess. (Note: The Thackeray records claim this line should descend through Roald, son of Roaldus "Le Enasse", but the Plantagenet-Harrison history claims, Roald had no children and thus the line descent is through Alan).<br>

Humbert DE RIE
<p>
<a name ="I007393"><b>[I007393]</b></a><br />
Son of Odo FitzGeoffry. In 1047 he saved young Duke William of Normandy's life when he was fleeing from Valognes, where the conspirators of the Cotentin were attempting to capture him. Hubert placed him on a fresh horse and giving misleading information to his pursuers, commanded his three sons, Ralph, Hubert and Adam (4th son Eudo apparently too young) to conduct him to Falaise, which they succeeded in doing. Later on, Duke William assembled some of his principal lords at a time when he wanted a messenger to go to England to attend Edward the Confessor, on behalf of his claim to the English crown. It was considered a very dangerous undertaking and Hubert alone of those present volunteered to make the perilous journey, on which he immediately departed. He returned with the promise of the kingdom for William with tokens confirming it from King Edward. Prior to 1060 he witnessed a donation to the abbey of Saint-Peter at Chartres. Hubert attended the Duke at the conquest of England with his sons, and a short ti me later was sent to Normandy to quell a disturbance there and was not heard of again in England. He died bef. 1086, as he is not mentioned in Domesday. His 4 sons were magnificently rewarded by the Conqueror and appear in that survey. [Falaise Roll, pp. 16-17]<br>
