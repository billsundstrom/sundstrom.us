Angela Christine LYNDS
<p>
<a name ="I029287"><b>[I029287]</b></a><br />
This section is normally written by the bride to tell about herself for all you people.  Well, most of you know about Angela, but do you know her through my eyes?  Where to begin.<br>
Angela Christine Lynds was born on April 7, 1976 in Denver, Colorado.  During the early years of her life, Angela had a difficult time, but with persevernce and determination she has came out on top.  I would say that she is A LOT smarter than me in the ways of the world and social interaction and fashion.  She is gorgeous, but yet strong and knows what she wants.  She is the type that if she knows she wants something, she will break down the goal to smaller and smaller pieces and schedule each task to complete her objective.  She will never see something  as being impossible to do and she always keeps me and everyone on task.  Order and structure are her friends and she in my eyes makes the chaos in the world into a structured list of events and gives me ideas on how to deal and resolve those events.<br>
People that know me, I am very adaptive to every situation, and sometimes driff off to 'Never Never Land' and I need an anchor to hold me in place.  Angela is that anchor.  Angela is the ying to my yang.  She is my complete opposite but yet I couldn't live without her.  She is sweet and kind, and honest, and true and purest of souls and I am lucky to have found her and terrified to lose her.  She brings out the best in me and inspires me to do more and to be better than I was.  She showed the value of trust and meaning of loving someone for better or for worst.<br>
