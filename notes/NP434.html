Ruth Ann PORTER
<p>
<a name ="I022419"><b>[I022419]</b></a><br />
Ruth A. Lownsberry, the seventh of eight children, was born August 18, 1931 to Clarence Wilber Porter and Alvina Amelia Gwecke in Bismarck North Dakota. A graduate of Bismarck High School, she was attending the Junior College in Bismarck (1951) she was called to Sioux City,Iowa to help her elder sister after a difficult birth. Ruth stayed on afterward and acquired a job as a teller at The First National Bank. Being neighbors of Orville and Mildred Lownsberry, Marion introduced Ruth to the family and was invited to their 4th of July picnic. That is when she officially met Duane. After that night they were inseparable. They were married on September 7, 1952 at the First Evangelical Lutheran Church in Bismarck, N.D. and returned to Sioux City where Duane continued his education at USD Vermillion.<br>
Early in 1953 Ruth lost her father, a few months later she contracted polio. She was one of the lucky ones, it was only the left side of her body, but, gave her problems he rest of her life.<br>
Duane graduated from USD Vermillion in June of 1954, and Ruth gave birth to her first child that July. They moved to Washington D.C. where Duane worked as a CPA . Then in December of 1954,during the Korean War, Duane enlisted in the Army and stationed at Ft. Hood. Ruth followed him to El Paso and gave birth to their second child in December of 1955. One year later, December of 1956, he was honorably discharged and moved to Denver, Colorado to join the General Accounting Office as a Supervisory Auditor.<br>
Unable to find a suitable church in the area, Duane and Ruth joined a small group of Christians meeting at the old Alameda Junior High (now the mini- Coors baseball fields at Alameda and Harlan). Soon a site for the church was chosen and Lutheran Church of the Resurrection was conceived. Their third and last child was born that March and the building at 7100 W. Mississippi Ave in Lakewood opened its doors on April 4, 1957. Ruth was very active in the church singing in the choir, preparing the altar for communion, ensuring the paraments were cleaned and stored properly with each season, heading up several of the womens' committees. She taught Sunday School, helped with fund raising events and she and Duane would not only greet each new visitor with warm smiles and conversation but invite them into their home and hearts. When she wasn't following Duane, with family in tow, she was involved 4-H, Westernnaires, and served on the first Interfaith Council in the 70's. She also was coordinator of the south-western section of Jefferson Counties Meals on Wheels (then part of Jeffco Action Center, now The Action Center).Both Ruth and Duane delivered the hot meals to shut-ins spreading their smiles and warmth wherever they went.<br>
On September 16,2010 Ruth lost her beloved Duane and in 2014 she lost the fight to keep Resurrection open. In 2015, she and her daughter, Marilyn, found Atonement Lutheran and a year later, February 2016 joined he church and choir. That May, Ruth fell and after a short stint in rehab moved into Atria/ Juniper senior center that June, located at 555 S Pierce St. apt#201 This place soon became her home. After a short period of adjustment, she resumed being active in all the centers activities and welcoming new residents. December of 2018, Ruth showed some signs of decline. This continued, and she entered the hospice care program that May. She died in her sleep, in her new "home", while her daughter read to her. She now resides in heaven, with her beloved Duane, 9 years and 2 days later.<br>
She was proceeded in death by her father Clarence (March 1953), mother Alvina (1981),her husband Duane (2010) her brothers Larry, Lester, Paul and Lyle Porter, sister Marion Lien and granddaughter Melisa Zeiderweg ( June 11,2017).<br>

Henry Edward PORTNER
<p>
<a name ="I019343"><b>[I019343]</b></a><br />
Henry is the son of Hezekiah Portner & Anna Belle Sprankle.<br>
He married twice: (1) Eleanor Lorraine Mohrman, 15 Jun 1941, Mt. Carroll, Carroll Co., IL; and (2) Doris Reisinger.<br>
Henry and Eleanor had two children: Margaret (Barr) & Patricia (Jacobs).<br>
Although Henry's tombstone indicates he was born in 1919, that is not correct. There was a large chart with her children's names & dates of birth that hung on the wall at Henry's mother's home. That chart shows that Henry was born 22 Oct 1922. Additionally, he was not on the 1920 census and was enumerated as age 7 on the 1930 census. Thus, he was born in 1922, not 1919.<br>

Afonso Henriques I of PORTUGAL
<p>
<a name ="I008284"><b>[I008284]</b></a><br />
From Wikipedia<br>
<br>
Afonso I of Portugal, more commonly known as Afonso Henriques, or also Alfonso, Alphonso or Alphonsus, (Guimarães, 1109, traditionally July 25 - Coimbra, 1185 December 6), also known as the Conqueror ( Port. o Conquistador), was the first king of Portugal, declaring his independence from Leon-Castile, a deed often identifying the Condado Portucalense as the first nation-based state of Europe (however Portuguese of that era were close kin to other tribes of Castile-Leon, their speech differing only at the level of dialect, not being separate languages - Portugal became a separate nation and people mostly due to its independence). Alfonso was the son of Henry, Count of Portugal and Teresa of Leon, the illegitimate daughter of Alfonso VI of Castile. He was proclaimed king in July 26, 1139 and died on December 6, 1185 in Coimbra.<br>
<br>
At the end of the 11th century, the Iberian Peninsula political agenda was mostly concerned with the Reconquista, the driving out of the Muslim successor-states to the Caliphate of Córdoba after its collapse. With European military aristocracies focused on the Crusades, Alfonso VI of Castile called for the help of the French nobility to deal with the Moors. In exchange, he was to give the hands of his daughters in wedlock to the leaders of the expedition and bestow royal privileges to the others. Thus, the royal heiress Urraca of Castile wedded Raymond, younger son of the Count of Burgundy, and her half-sister, princess Teresa of Leon, wedded his distant kinsman, another French crusader, Henry of Burgundy, younger brother of the Duke of Burgundy whose mother was daughter of Count of Barcelona. Henry was made Count of Portugal, a burdensome earldom in the south of Castile, where Moorish incursions and attacks were to be expected. With his wife Teresa as co-ruler of Portugal, Henry stood the ordeal and held the lands for his father-in-law.<br>
<br>
From this wedlock several sons were born, but only one, Afonso Henriques (meaning "Afonso son of Henry") thrived. The boy followed his father as Count of Portugal in 1112, under the tutelage of his mother. The relations between Teresa and her son Afonso proved difficult. Only eleven years old, Afonso had already his own political ideas, greatly different from his mother's. In 1120, the young prince took the side of the archbishop of Braga, a political foe of Teresa, and both were exiled by her orders. Afonso spent the next years away from his own county, under the watch of the bishop. In 1123 Afonso became fourteen, the adult age in the 12th century. He made himself a knight on his own account in the cathedral of Zamora, raised an army, and proceeded to take control of his lands. Near Guimarães he overcame the troops under his mother's lover and ally Count Fernão Peres de Trava of Galicia, making her his prisoner and exiling her forever to a monastery in León. Thus the possibility of incorporating Portugal into a kingdom of Galicia was eliminated. He also vanquished Alfonso VII of Castile, another of his mother's allies, and thus freed the county from political dependence on the crown of León and Castile. He had already a dangerously independent mind. On April 6, 1129, Afonso Henriques dictated the writ in which he proclaims himself King of Portugal.<br>
<br>
Afonso then turned his arms against the everlasting problem of the Moors in the south. His campaigns were successful and, on July 26, 1139, he obtained an overwhelming victory in the Battle of Ourique, and straight after was unanimously proclaimed king by his soldiers. This meant that Portugal was no longer a vassal county of Castile, but an independent kingdom in its own right. Next, he assembled the first assembly of the estates-general at Lamego, where he was given the crown from the bishop of Bragança, to confirm the independence.<br>
<br>
Independence, however, was not a thing a land could choose on its own. Portugal had still to be acknowledged by the neighbouring lands and, most important, by the Catholic church and the pope. Afonso wedded Mafalda, daughter of Count Amadeo III of Savoy, and sent ambassadors to Rome to negotiate with the pope. In Portugal, he built several monasteries and convents and bestowed important privileges to religious orders. In 1143, he wrote to Pope Innocent II to declare himself and the kingdom servants of the Church, swearing to pursue driving the Moors out of the Iberian peninsula. Bypassing any king of Castile, Afonso declared himself the direct liegeman of the Papacy. Thus, Afonso continued to distinguish himself by his exploits against the Moors, from whom he wrested Santarém in 1146 and Lisbon in 1147 (see Siege of Lisbon). He also conquered an important part of the land south of the Tagus River, although this was lost again to the Moors in the following years.<br>
<br>
Meanwhile, King Alfonso VII of Castile (Afonso's cousin) regarded the independent ruler of Portugal as nothing but a rebel. Conflict between the two was constant and bitter in the following years. Afonso became involved in a war, taking the sides of the Aragonese king, an enemy of Castile. To ensure the alliance, his son Sancho was engaged to Dulce Berenguer, sister of the Count of Barcelona, and princess of Aragon. Finally, probably in 1143, the Treaty of Zamora established peace between the cousins and the recognition by the Kingdom of Castile and Leon that Portugal was an independent Kingdom.<br>
<br>
In 1167, Afonso was disabled in an engagement near Badajoz by a fall from his horse, and made prisoner by the soldiers of the king of Leon. Portugal was obliged to surrender as his ransom almost all the conquests Afonso had made in Galicia in the previous years.<br>
<br>
In 1179 the privileges and favours given to the Catholic Church were compensated. In a papal bull, Pope Alexander III acknowledged Afonso as king and Portugal as an independent land with the right to conquer lands from the Moors. With this papal blessing, Portugal was at last secured as a country and safe from any Castilian attempts of annexation.<br>
<br>
In 1184, in spite of his great age, he had still sufficient energy to relieve his son Sancho, who was besieged in Santarém by the Moors. He died shortly after, in 1185.<br>
<br>
The Portuguese revere him as a hero, both on account of his personal character and as the founder of their kingdom.<br>
