CHARLO-Vern Edmond "Bud" Cheff Sr., 96, lifetime Mission Valley resident, passed on to meet the Lord on Monday, June 27, 2011, at his home with his family.<br>
He joins his beloved wife Adelle; daughter Viola; parents Marie and Ovila Cheff; brothers Leo, Rex, Chris, Louie, Vila, Jim and Ray; sisters Bernida, Grace and Josephine; and grandchildren Corey, Billy, Amanda and Cheri.<br>
He is survived by three brothers, Floyd, Herman and Clarence; five sons and their families, Bud Jr. and wife Laurie, Kenny, Buck and wife Cheryl, Mick and wife Karen and Happy; and daughter Roxy and husband Don. He was also blessed with 33 grandchildren, 82 great-grandchildren and 18 great-great-grandchildren.<br>
Bud was born April 2, 1915, southeast of Ronan on the Tehnum Finley place. He went to school in Ronan, and in 1933 married his childhood sweetheart, Adelle Rogers. They were sweethearts from the fifth grade on.<br>
Bud took his first paying customers as a outfitter into the Bob Marshall Wilderness that year, starting a lifetime career as an outfitter and guide. He was honored last year for being Montana's oldest living outfitter and having the longest ongoing outfitting business in the state, from 1933 to 2011. It is still a flourishing family-owned business. He was invited to speak at a number of universities in Western states, including a convention of worldwide scientists held in Glacier Park. Bud had a deep love for Montana and its wilderness areas; he was devoted to preserving the wildlife and land for future generations.<br>
Bud's family had early roots in Montana, starting with a free trapper for David Thompson and the Northwest Fur Co. in 1810, to the settling of Frenchtown and Demersville in the Flathead. His parents came from Ontario, Canada, in the late 1890s to join other family members already settled here.<br>
Of French and Iroquois descent, Bud's family had close ties with the Flathead Indians. Bud went with them every year until 1933 on their hunting and gathering trips into the Mission Range and Bob Marshall area, under the leadership of Eneas Conko. Eneas and the old Indian hunters taught him well as he had a vast knowledge of wildlife and the mountains.<br>
Bud wrote two books, "Indian Trails and Grizzly Tales" and "The Woodsman and his Hatchet." Outdoor Life magazine did a series of stories about Bud and his hunting experiences.<br>
Starting as an ironworker on Kerr Dam, Bud also worked on Hungry Horse and Noxon dams, the Frenchtown pulp mill, Columbia Falls aluminum plant and numerous bridges over the years. He was a top-notch cowboy and broncobuster, breaking hundreds of horses and mules in his lifetime.<br>
Bud and Adelle were instrumental in starting the First Baptist Church in Ronan. They were charter members and co-founders of the Ninepipes Museum of Early Montana. He was loved by the schoolchildren who toured the museum and received many thank-you letters from them.<br>
Bud was loved and admired by all who knew him. He was a storehouse of Montana history, had a wonderful memory, and loved to share his knowledge with all who were interested. His hope was to leave this world a little better than he found it, and he prayed that he had not offended any of the wonderful people he had met and cherished in his long life.<br>
He will be sorely missed by all.<br>
Memorials may be made to the Ninepipes Museum of Early Montana.<br>
Visitation will be 1-7 p.m. Friday, July 1, at Shrider-Thompson Funeral &?Cremation Service in Ronan.<br>
Services will be held at 11 a.m. Saturday, July 2, at the Ronan High School gymnasium followed by a horse-drawn hearse procession to the Ronan Cemetery. A reception will follow at the Ronan Community Center.<br>

2. Nathaniel apparently became ill and died unexpectedly as there is no r ecord of a will. His estate depended on his parents and his brother Elisa 's son Elihu's wills and or estate probates. His estate was distribut ed by a court decision resolving discrepancies in his parents' (William a nd Anna Stevenson Chesebrough) will and a subsequent probate (from the Wil dey book with minor punctuation changes for clarity):<br>
</p>
William CHESEBROUGH
<p>
<a name ="I009162"><b>[I009162]</b></a><br />
Assumed born in or near Boston, Lincolnshire where he was known to have had his residence some eleven or twelve years prior to his emigration to America. Sarah Chesebrough, whose name stands #78 on the roll of the First Church of Boston, MA, was doubtless a passenger with William on the ship, Arbella, and is thought to have been his mother.<br>
<br>
Burial: 1667 Old Wequetoquock Burial Ground, Stonington<br>
The Wequetequock Burial Ground Association in Stonington, CT, on 31Aug 1899, dedicated a monument which had been erected as a memorial to the first four settlers of Wequetequock: William Chesebrough, Thomas Minor, Walter Palmer and Thomas Stanton. Each side of the monument carries an epitaph, above which has been carved a coat of arms.<br>
The Chesebrough epitaph reads as follows:<br>
    William Chesebrough<br>
    The first white settler of Stonington<br>
    Born in England 1594 migrated to America in John<br>
    Winthrop's Company which planted Boston in 1630.<br>
    After spending a few years in Rehoboth Mass.<br>
    he with his wife and four sons in 1649 fixed<br>
    his home in this then wilderness and built his<br>
    dwelling house not far from this monument.<br>
    He took a leading part in the organization<br>
    of the town and the conduct of its early affairs.<br>
    He died June 9, 1667.<br>
    A Bold Pioneer. A Wise Organizer. A Firm Christian.<br>
<br>
The remains of William & Anna rest side by side in the old cemetery, a short distance from their dwelling house.<br>
<br>
Immigration: 29 MAR 1630 Salem, Essex, MA<br>
William Chesbrough sailed from Cowes, Eng. in the ship "Arbella" on 29 Mar 1630 and arrived at Salem, MA on 14 Jun 1630, Capt. Peter Milbourne, master. The "Arbella" was a ship of 350 tons and wastermed the "Admiral" of the Winthrop fleet that left Cowes, Eng. in 1630. The fleet consisted of 14 vessels with 840 passengers comprising the Massachusetts Bay Colony. Aboard were William Cheesebrough, from Boston, Lincoln, blacksmith, with wife Ann, daughter Sarah and sons Peter, Samuel & Nathaniel.<br>
Made a freeman of Boston, MA, 18 May 1631, and note is made of the fact that on the same day his house burned to the ground; was one of the first two deputies from Boston to the General Court, was a constable, assessor, and one of a committee "to a lot to able bodied men and youth" grounds for planting.<br>
<br>
Occupation: Gunsmith 1625 Braintree, Suffolk, MA<br>
William Chesebrough, a gunsmith, came in the spring of 1649, overland from Rehobeth in Plymouth where he had been accused (falsely, he always maintained) of selling firearms to the Indians. He picked a site on a knoll on the west bank at the head of Wequetequock Cove where there was a well sheltered landing place and open meadows for grazing and cultivation. But the authorities suspected he planned illicit trade in rum and firearms with the Indians, so on 7 Nov 1649, the constable at Pequot (New London) informed him that "the Goverm't of Connecticut doth dislike and distastes the way he is in and trade he doth among the Indians' and they doe require him to desiste there from," ordering him to report to Major John Mason at Saybrook and give an account of himself and his lonely settlement.<br>
On 19 Mar 1650, William Chesebrough appeared before the General Court in Hartford which questioned his settling at Wequetequock "in that by his calling (gunsmith) he was fitted, and by his solitary living advantaged, to carry on a mischievous trade with the Indians...extremely prejudiciall to the publique safety...so to withdraw from all publique ordnances and Xtian society." To which he replied that he had sold his tools "thereby making himself incapable of repairing any gun locks" and that he hoped others would join him. He was required to post a bond that others would join his settlement by September next.<br>
<br>

<br>
Land 1652 Stonington, New London, CT<br>
The title of William Chesebrough to all land between Wadawanuck Point and Wequetoquock Cove was confirmed by the General Court at NewLondon in 1652.<br>
The action of the General Court of Connecticut in pushing its claims eastward to the Pawcatuck River created many political battles with Massachusets and until the matter could be resolved amicably, the planters were advised "to carry themselves & order their affaires peaceably, and by comon agreement." Acting on this advice, the original settlers and a few others who had joined them, met together on 30 Jun 1658 and organized a local government with what may betermed a consitution, entitled "The Asoiation of Poquatuck peple, "which was signed by eleven persons, viz.: William Cheeseborough and his three sons, Samuel, Nathaniel and Elisha; Thomas Stanton and his son Thomas; Walter Palmer and his two sons Elihu and Moses; George Denison, and Thomas Shaw. This compact in the handwriting of WilliamCheeseborough, pledged the signers "to maintain and deffend the peacof the plac * to aid and asist one another acoarding to law & rules of righteousness, till such other provisions be maide for us as mayatain our end above written.: After affixing their names to the document, the signers chose Capt. George Denison and William Cheeseborough to be "comytioners" to carry out the provisions of the contract. Three months later, the commissioners of the United Colonies decided that the territory in dispute belonged to Massachusetts, and the General Court of that Colony named it Southerntown and annexed it to the County of Suffolk. Southerntown remained a township of MA until the issue of the Charter of CT by King Charles II, dated 25 Apr 1662 fixed the eastern boundary of CT at Pawcatuck River and reverted back to the sister colony.<br>
In 1665, the name of Southerntown was changed to that of Mystic, and the year following was changed to Stonington.<br>
<br>

Land 1649 New London, New London, CT<br>
This year a considerable settlement was made between Mistic and Pawcatuck rivers. This tract was called Pequot, and originally belonged to New-London. The first man who settled upon this tract, was William Cheesebrough, from Rehoboth, in 1649. A complaint was exhibited against him for carrying on an illicit trade with the Indians, for repairing their arms, and endangering the public safety. The teneral court of CT declared, that they had a clear title to those lands, and summoned him before them. They reprimanded him for settling upon them without their approbation; for withdrawing himself from Christian society and ordinances; and for unlawfully trading with and assisting the Indians. He confessed his faults; but pleaded, inexcuse, that he had been encouraged by Mr. Winthrop, who claimed aright to Pawcatuck. He gave bonds for his good conduct, and wasallowed to continue upon the land.<br>
After successive explorations William chose the head of Wequetequock Cove, in what is now called Pawcatuck, on the border lands of which he found arable lands for planting, with an abundance of pasture ground for stock raising, to which he had largely turned his attention. After building a dwelling house on the west side of the cove, William removed with his wife and four sons, assisted by his friend, Roger Williams, founder of Rhode Island, in the summer of 1649. William was55 years old, wife Anna 51y, son Samuel 22y, Nathaniel 19y, John 17yand Elisha 12y.<br>

Land 1646 Rehoboth, Bristol, MA<br>
On 12 Jul 1644 Rehoboth town meeting ordered that William Cheeseborough "is to have division in all lands of Seekunk for L153besides what he is to have for his own proportion, and that in way of consideration for the pains and charges he hath been at for settling of this plantation."<br>
After a relatively peaceful few years in Boston and Braintree, William removed to Rehoboth where he was soon in trouble with the Plymouth authorities: On 5 May 1646 Plymouth Court ordered that theconstable at Rehoboth arrest "Willm Cheesborrow" for his part in "anaffray made upon Ussamequine and some of his people"; "Wm. Cheesborrow of Rehoboth, blacksmith," had to post L20 bond. On 2 Jun 1646 the court reported that "William Cheesborrow, of Rehoboth, for mending two locks for pieces at three shillings apiece, and for his abuse of Ussamequin, as the case now stands betwixt us and him, and for his breach of imprisonment and flying to a foreign government, and leaving this, is censured by the Court to be imprisoned fourteen days, without bail or main prize, and to pay L6 fine to the colony's use." (The "foreign government" may have been Providence, RI, since on 22 Jun 1645 Roger Williams reported to John Winthrop Jr. that "Wm Cheesbrough now come in shall be readily assisted for your and his own sake.")<br>

WILLIAM CHESEBROUGH, was the first white man who settled Stonington, Connecticut. His dwelling house stood on the west side of Wequetequock Cove, near the head of the tidewater.<br>
<br>
Chesebrough was born in Boston, Lincolnshire, England in 1594. On December 6, 1620, he married Anna Stevenson. He was a gunsmith until he came to Stonington in 1649, when he became a farmer, living on the large grants of land given him by the town of Pequot (now New London).<br>
<br>
He came to this country with the John Winthrop Company in 1630 and first settled in Boston, Massachusetts and became a member of the first church. In May 1631, he was admitted a freeman of the Massachusetts Colony.<br>
<br>
In 1634, he was elected constable of Boston. He later moved to Braintree, and in 1640 he was elected deputy to the Massachusetts General Court. Soon after, he moved to Rehoboth, Plymouth Colony where he took an active and prominent part in organizing the town of Rehoboth.<br>
<br>
The General Court of that colony later ordered him to be arrested for an affray with an Indian, which led him to look further for a new permanent home. John Winthrop, Jr. urged Chesebrough to settle in his new settlement at Pequot, but he decided against it and and finally chose to settle at the head of Wequetequock Cove in the Pawcatuck area instead. It was another friend, Roger Williams, who encouraged and assisted him in moving to Pawcatuck during the summer of 1649 when he moved his family into their new house in Wequetequock, including his wife and four sons, Samuel, Nathaniel, John and Elisha.<br>
<br>
Mr. Chesebrough, traded with the Indians and with people of Long Island, which was prohibited by the General Assembly of Connecticut. In January, 1652, the town of Pequot gave him a large tract of land, which was afterwards liberally enlarged until it embraced between two and three thousand acres. Mr. Chesebrough succeeded in drawing around him a number of "acceptable persons" and the settlement of the town was begun. In 1654, however, the planters wanted to separate from Pequot for religious and civil purposes. This measure was resisted by the planters at Pequot. In the meantime, Massachusetts laid claim to the settlement, and the dispute went up to the court of the Commissioners of the United Colonies. In 1658 the court awarded all the territory east of Mystic River to the Massachusetts Colony, under the name of Southertown, until 1662, when it was included in the new charter, and again became a part of the colony of Connecticut. In 1665, the name Southertown was changed to Mystic. In 1666, it was again changed to Stonington.<br>
<br>
Mr. Chesebrough held numerous positions of trust not only in the Massachusetts Colony, in the town of Rehoboth, in Plymouth Colony as well. He was elected to several positions between 1653 and 1656.<br>
<br>
He held the office of Townsman (Selectman) until Southertown was annexed to Connecticut, and was the first man elected deputy after the reunion. He succeeded in restoring amicable relations with the Court which had been seriously disturbed by the jurisdictional controversy. After his return, he was elected first selectman of the town, and re-elected every year up to the time of his death, on June 9, 1667.<br>
