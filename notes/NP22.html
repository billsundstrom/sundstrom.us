Edna Louvena BARKER
<p>
<a name ="I018038"><b>[I018038]</b></a><br />
Edna Schultz loved flowers, especially roses, and worked hard for decades to make sure others could enjoy them as much as possible. <br>
You may have seen her work a time or two. Those who like to stroll through the Julia Davis Rose Garden or enjoy the flower competition at the Western Idaho Fair can thank Schultz for turning her life-long love of flowers into support for the garden and the competition. <br>
Schultz loved flowers so much that she told her friends she didn't want a memorial service after her death. She told them their time would be better spent remembering her when they see and smell a blooming rose or chrysanthemum. And if they wanted to make a contribution in her name, the preferred destination was to the Julia Davis Rose Garden, a colorful oasis of 2,400 roses of all shapes and colors. <br>
" Edna was an original ... and an inspiration to be around," said Amy Dohmen, the current president of the Idaho Rose Society, a group Shultz helped form in 1978 and that raises money to maintain the rose garden in Boise's Julia Davis Park. "She was the last founding member, and her passing marks the end of an era. <br>
"Even when she got sick (in the early 2000s) and couldn't be an active member anymore, Edna 's first question was always 'How are the roses?' " <br>
Shultz also was in charge of the flower show at the Western Idaho Fair from 1974 to 1990. Dohmen said one time Schultz used dark beer bottles as makeshift vases so the roses stood out from other flowers at the fair. <br>
Her love of flowers meant some travel: Shultz judged flower shows throughout the Pacific Northwest for many years. She also was an active member of the Golden Garden Club and the Chrysanthemum Club, in addition to her work with the Idaho Rose Society. <br>
The 91-year-old Schultz died of natural causes on April 14 at a local care facility. <br>
She was born in August 1919 on her family farm near Weiser. She loved to work in the orchards with her father and brother at their Fruitland-area farm. She graduated from Fruitland High School in 1937. That's when she first moved to Boise so she could attend Boise Business College and the Buss Grimm School of Business before being hired as the first secretary of the Boise Police Department. She worked at the department until 1941. <br>
Schultz also worked at Gowen Field, where she met her future husband, Joe Schultz , and at Mountain Home Air Force Base. She married Joe in 1944, and they moved to Louisiana and Chicago before returning to Boise in 1948, which is when Edna began working on her gardening and flower activities. <br>
While the idea for the Julia Davis Rose Garden may have originated in the 1930s with H.C. Schuppel, who was a chairman of a Men's Garden Club called the Cut Worms and who didn't want any women to be involved, it is groups like the Idaho Rose Society and women like Schultz who have helped the garden become what it is now. <br>
One of the garden's most prestigious accomplishments is an accreditation from All America Rose Selections Public Rose Garden. That means it gets 10 bushes of each year's AARS All American rose winners. <br>
Schultz and her fellow Idaho Rose Club members also helped create the Memorial Rose Fund in 1979, which uses donations to fund memorials such as the fountains in the rose garden. <br>
Dohmen said Edna Schultz wasn't able to be involved in the Idaho Rose Society for the last several years because of early onset Alzheimer's, but even when she struggled to remember other things, she never forgot her love of flowers. <br>
Edna Schultz is survived by her son, Richard. <br>

Funeral services will be at 2 p.m. Friday, March 22, at Shaffer-Jensens, with interment at the Riverside Cemetery in Payette. <br>
Ray was born on Feb. 2, 1917, north of Weiser at Mann Creek, to Henry T. Barker and Rosa L. Sullens Barker . He was the second of four children. His family moved to Gay Way, Idaho, when he was almost 5 years old to own and operate an orchard. He attended the Fruitland schools until his sophomore year. Ray was a man of vast knowledge and experience. He had a variety of jobs ranging from working in the orchards, pumping gas at Adys service station to feeding cattle. His hard work led him and his brother, Ralph, to own Barker Brothers, a custom feeding and farming operation on the Oregon slope. They eventually acquired their own herd of cattle. Ray and Ralph continued to farm together for approximately 40 years until Ralph passed away. Ray then sold the cattle and rented out his land. <br>
On Dec. 17, 1939, Ray married Frances Cassingham. They had one daughter. Ray was the kind of man everyone enjoyed being around. He had a witty sense of humor and never passed up an opportunity to joke. He had a genuine appreciation for family and friends. He especially enjoyed time with his grandchildren and great-grandchildren during the holidays and Saturday get togethers. During the evenings he liked to watch boxing and WWF Smackdown. Ray also had a special knack for making dill pickles, fudge frosting and strawberry jams. <br>
Ray is preceded in death by his parents, Henry and Rosa Barker and his younger brother, Ralph. <br>
He is survived by his loving wife, Frances, of 62 years; daughter, Carol and husband, William Gale; grandsons, William Wilson and wife, Sharla, daughter Kyla; Terry Wilson and wife, Patricia, daughter, Dakota; William Gale Jr. and Joseph Wilson; granddaughter, Lennie and Justin Hill; two sisters, Edna Schultz and Verna Mitchell; and numerous nieces, nephews, cousins and friends.

Verna Louise BARKER
<p>
<a name ="I018036"><b>[I018036]</b></a><br />
Verna Louise Mitchell Verna Louise Mitchell passed away peacefully in her sleep at home surrounded by her family on Dec. 20, 2008, at the age of 94. A graveside service will take place at 2 p.m. today, Tuesday, Dec. 23, 2008 at Dry Creek Cemetery under the direction of Alden-Waggoner Funeral Chapel, Boise. Verna was born at home on the family ranch on Manns Creek north of Weiser, Idaho, on July 4, 1914. She was the eldest child of Henry T. and Rosa Sullens Barker. Over the next few years her brothers and sister Raymond, Edna, and Ralph joined the family. The family moved to their home near Fruitland, Idaho, where they had fruit orchards. Verna attended school in Fruitland and graduated from Fruitland High School. After going to business school in Boise, she began working for Home Lumber Company where she met the love of her life, Leland Wesley "Mitch" Mitchell , whom she married on Nov. 28, 1943. Verna and Mitch had three daughters, Lola, Beverly, and Sandra. During his senior year in high school, Monty Aarestad lived with Mom and Dad and has been like a son to Mom over the intervening years. Mom's life was centered on Dad, her daughters, and family. Mom and Dad created a warm and loving home filled with memories created by their hands. Mom enjoyed flowers and lovingly cared for a large yard and flower and vegetable garden until she was ninety when her deteriorating eyesight limited her ability. She enjoyed taking a break from gardening to visit with her neighbors. Mom loved the holidays filled with bouquets, wreaths, mistletoe, and homemade candy, cookies, and fruitcake. Decorating the Christmas tree was a family event to be remembered. Having her family together for any celebration was important to Mom, and she liked nothing better than baking a birthday cake and making a favorite meal for each member of the family. Mom was a skilled seamstress who made clothes for us and her grandchildren as well as curtains, pillows, and accessories for our home. She would often sit at the kitchen table hooking one of countless rugs. With the advent of artificial flowers, Mom could create beautiful bouquets to grace the tables any time of the year. Her touches were evidence of her love for her family. Mom and Dad cherished the arrival of each grandchild and spent happy hours holding them and watching them grow. Grandma would fill the candy dish with butter mints and bake chocolate chip cookies for which Grandpa would say just one; they were a team. Grandma's door and heart were always open for her grandchildren. Mom especially cherished the visits the last two summers from granddaughter Brooke Eppa and her family, Steven, Michael, Evan, and Drew. She loved to watch the little boys and to share her cereal snack with them. In the last few years as Mom became less able to care for herself, she developed a special bond with granddaughters Michelle and Melody. Melody and Grandma became best friends as Melody nursed her back to health after two illnesses and was her constant caregiver during the last two years. Grandma responded to Melody's voice and touch. Verna is survived by her daughter Lola Lynch and family Stephan, Michelle, and Melody Lynch of Boise: her daughter Beverly Mitchell of Seattle, Washington; and daughter and son-in-law Sandy and Tom Supnet of Meridian, Idaho and their family, Brooke, Steve, Michael, Evan, and Drew Eppa of Pansauken, New Jersey, Galen Kindall of Boise, Derrick Supnet and family Dominic and Aalysha of Nampa, and Dustin Supnet and family Francis, Evelynn, Elmer, and Abigail of Nampa; and special friend Monty Aarestad of Athol, Idaho. She is also survived by her sister Edna Schultz of Boise and sister-in-law Maxine Barker of Ontario, Ore., and by nieces and nephews and their families Richard Schultz, Carol and Bill Gale, Linda Barker, and Janet and Phil Nelson. Verna was preceded in death by her husband Leland Mitchell ; her parents Henry and Rosa Barker; her brother Ralph Barker; her brother Raymond and sister-in-law Frances Barker; her brother-in-law Joseph Schultz; and her cousin Oakley Barker. We would like to thank Mom's doctor Shandra Grooms, her hospice caregivers Crystal, Jody, and Russ, and her home caregivers Becky, Neva, Laura, Jennilee, and Kim who made it possible for Mom to spend her last days at home where she most wanted to be with her family.<br>
