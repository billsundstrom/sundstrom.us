Mollie Elizabeth DEANE
<p>
<a name ="I053950"><b>[I053950]</b></a><br />
On January 16, 2019, Mollie Elizabeth Deane Bexell, at the age of 96, slipped away quietly in her sleep to be with the Lord.  Her husband, Bert, preceded her in death in 2014 and she is survived by her three daughters, Karen (Dennis) Smith, Christine (Jack) Dalrymple and Claudette (Rick) Frame, as well as a brother-in-law, nieces and nephews and three generations of grandchildren.  She also leaves behind many friends in whose lives she was a true and faithful presence.<br>
Born and raised in Michigan, she met her husband in Pontiac, where she raised her family. Though she worked as a legal secretary for many years, her main focus was always her family and her church.  She served as treasurer, played the piano and sang in the choir in the church where her father had served as pastor.  The values of honesty, integrity, hard work and faithfulness were not just words to her, but what she taught to her children and grandchildren and lived out in her life every day.<br>
She and Bert moved to Gaylord after retirement where she continued to serve in her community and church.  After some years in Frankenmuth, she spent her last years in Chattanooga, TN, near family and in nursing care. <br>
She was loved.  She will be missed.  But the loss we feel cannot be measured against her joy on waking up in God's presence. She will always be remembered by all that knew her as a very remarkable woman.<br>
A memorial service will take place on Saturday, January 26, 2019 at 3pm at Mile Straight Baptist Church, 8448 Springfield Rd., Soddy Daisy, TN<br>
