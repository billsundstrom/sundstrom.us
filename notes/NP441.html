<br>
Randvér or Randver was according to Sögubrot and the Lay of Hyndla, the son of Radbart the king of Gardariki and Aud the daughter of Ivar Vidfamne. In these two sources Aud had Randver's brother Harald Hildetand in a previous marriage.<br>
<br>
According to Hervarar saga both Randver and Harald Hildetand and were the sons of Valdar and Alfhild, the daughter of Ivar Vidfamne. This saga relates that Ivar appointed Valdar the king of Denmark, and when Valdar died, he was succeeded by Randver. When his brother Harald, had reclaimed Götaland (or Gotland depending on the manuscript), Randver died hastily in England, and was succeeded by Sigurd Ring as the king of Denmark (probably as Harald's viceroy).<br>
<br>
He was married to Ingild, the daughter of an unknown Swedish king. He was succeeded by his son Sigurd Ring.<br>

Bjorn RAGNARSSON
<p>
<a name ="I007804"><b>[I007804]</b></a><br />
Björn Járnsı́đa or Björn Järnsida, Swedish king (ca 785-800) was a legendary viking from the 8th century. He was one of the sons of Ragnar Lodbrok. He pillaged in Italy and took part in the conquest of Paris with his father Ragnar Lodbrok.<br>
<br>
He acquired the name ironside because he was never wounded in battle. This invulnerability was attributed to his mother Aslaug's use of seid in order to make him impervious to iron and steel.<br>
<br>
According to Hervarar saga he inherited Sweden from his father while his brother Sigurd Snake-Eye inherited the remainder of Scandinavia.<br>
<br>
The dynasty he founded is called the House of Munsö by modern historians, because a local tradition claims that he is buried in Björnshögen at Husby on the island of Munsö. Many of his dynasty were to be named Björn.<br>
<br>
He had two sons, Refil and Erik Björnsson, and Erik succeeded him on the throne.<br>

Ivar RAGNARSSON
<p>
<a name ="I009761"><b>[I009761]</b></a><br />
Acceded 856. Conquered York 866/7, Slayer Of St. Edmund Of East Anglia 869<br>
<br>
They headquartered in Ireland and raided York on All Saints Day, 1 Nov 866.<br>
<br>
Royal Families of Medieval Scandinavia places Ivar the Boneless, "participated in the martyrdom of St. Edmund in 869 in England . . . also took part in the siege of Dumbarton (in Scotland) in 870 . . . king of the Norsemen of all Ireland and Britain", as son of Ragnar. Rudolph Krutar, following a "classic" ancestry of Somerled, by the Clan MacDonald, has obviously the same Ivar/Ivarr as father of Guthorm probably King of Dublin, but with the following ancestry:<br>
1. Ivarr, King of Dublin; sacked Dunbarton in 870.<br>
2. King Godfrey; raided Ireland in 854, d. 873.<br>
4. King Ranald "Higher than the Hills"; expelled to Orkney.<br>
8. Olaf "Geirstada-Alf", King in Vestfold, 810-840 (in my files as Olaf Gudrodson, b. c790, d. 840)<br>
<br>
<br>
From Wikipedia<br>
<br>
Ivar the Boneless (Ivar inn beinlausi) (c. 794 - 872 in Dublin) was the nickname of Ivar Ragnarsson. He was a Viking chieftain (and by reputation also a berserker), who, in 865 AD, with his brothers Halfdan Ragnarsson (Halfdene) and Ubbe Ragnarsson (Hubba), invaded the East Anglian region of England. An accommodation was quickly reached with the East Anglians. The following year, Ivar led his forces north on horseback and easily captured Jorvik (what the Danes called York) from the Northumbrians who were at that time engaged in a civil war.<br>
<br>
Ivar is also attributed with the slaying of St Edmund of East Anglia in 869 AD.<br>
<br>
There is some disagreement as to the meaning of Ivar's epithet "Boneless." Some have suggested it was a euphemism for impotence or even a snake metaphor (he had a brother named Snake-Eye). However, the Scandinavian sources describe a condition very similar to a form of osteogenesis imperfecta (see below).<br>
<br>
Scandinavian sources<br>
Ivar Boneless was according to the saga of Ragnar Lodbrok, the eldest son of Ragnar and Kraka. He had only cartilage in his legs and so he could not walk, but had to be carried on a shield. However, it is said he was fair, big, strong and one of the wisest men who have ever lived. He was consequently the advisor of his brothers Björn Ironside, Sigurd Snake-Eye and Hvitserk.<br>
<br>
When king Ælla of Northumberland had murdered their father by throwing him into a snake-pit, Ivar's brothers tried to avenge their father, but were beaten. Ivar then went to king Ælla and said that he sought reconciliation. He only asked for as much land as he could cover with an ox's hide and swore never to wage war against Ælla. Then Ivar cut the ox's hide into so fine strands that he could envelope a large fortress (in an older saga it was York and according to a younger saga it was London) which he could take as his own. As he was the most generous of men, he attracted a great many warriors, whom he consequently kept from Ælla when this king was attacked by Ivar's brothers for the second time.<br>
<br>
Ælla was captured and when the brothers were to decide how to give Ælla his just punishment, Ivar suggested that they carve the "blood eagle" on his back. This meant that Ælla's back was cut open, the ribs pulled from his spine and his lungs removed. After justice had been served, Ivar became the king of England.<br>
