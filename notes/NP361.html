<h2>Notes</h2>
Thomas Bradford MCMAHILL
<p>
<a name ="I077360"><b>[I077360]</b></a><br />
The following obituary confuses me.<br>
I am not sure if Thomas was the son of Delbert.  My best guess is that Veronica Low was married to Thomas Abbey, and Thomas McMahill is the son of Thoms Abbey.  Make of it what you will. The obit follows:<br>
Ellen's life began on August 26, 1934 in Glenwood, MI; the daughter of Thomas and Ellen (Dorman) Abbey. She was united in marriage to Dan C. White on April 10, 1976 in Dowagiac. JoEllen was an x-ray technician in the Chicagoland area for many years working at St. Francis Hospital in Blue Island, St. James Hospital in Chicago Heights, Weiss Memorial Hospital in Harvey and Lurie Cancer Center in Chicago. She was a member of the INA Unity Club, Dowagiac Junior Arts and a faithful member of St. Paul's Lutheran Church in Niles. Her loving family includes her husband Dan White of Eau Claire, daughter Charmain (Dennis) Benton of Geneva, IL, brothers Ronnie (Kathleen) Merritt of Springfield, MO, and Thomas (Sheila) McMahill of Bradford, IL, aunts Hilda Gordon, Lorna Garritano, and Leona Morford, and several nieces and nephews. JoEllen passed away on Sunday March 11, 2012 at Borgess Lee Memorial Hospital. She is preceded in death by her parents. Her family will gather with friends on Wednesday from 5-8 p.m. at Yazel & Clark Chapel. Private family funeral services will be held on Thursday. She will be laid to rest in Riverside Cemetery, Dowagiac. Memorial contributions in her name may be directed to St. Paul's Lutheran Church in Niles. <br>
