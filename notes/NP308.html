<a name ="I023406"><b>[I023406]</b></a><br />
Olga Kulchisky was born in Smoky Lake on September 12, 1914 on the family farm. She was the second oldest child of Harry and Wasylena Kulchisky, who had a family of seven children. Her father, with his brothers, and neighbours built St. Onufry's Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church in 1910. Some years later the family moved into town to take on the ownership and operation of a general store and telephone exchange office.<br>
Olga attended White Mud country school until grade seven. She then took grade eight at McKay Avenue School in Edmonton, and was promoted to grade nine without having to write the required provincial exams. Olga attended grade nine and ten at Smoky Lake. Her grade 11 she took at a separate high school in Edmonton.<br>
Upon completion of her schooling, Olga worked as a switchboard operator with Alberta Government Telephones in Smoky Lake from 1933 to 1937 with an interim period at the local post office. During her early working years she also participated in Ukrainian dancing and plays.<br>
On July 22, 1937 Olga married Tom Ternoway. After their marriage they continued to farm on the original Ternoway homestead that had been settled in 1902 and which Olga would proudly call home until her passing. Olga and Tom raised a family of two daughters, Shirley and Beatrice.<br>
Olga was very active and devoted to her church - Sts. Volodymyr and Olha Ukrainian Catholic Church. She helped with the upkeep of St. Onufry's Cemetery. She served as president and secretary of the church club and was a choir member for many years. She was extremely proud to be part of the 100 person "Centennial Choir" that performed for two years in celebration of 100 years of Ukrainian Settlement in Canada.<br>
In 1954 she returned to work as a telephone operator and remained at this job until 1967. From 1970 to 1976 she worked as a nursing ward aide at the Smoky Lake Nursing Home as well as running her own catering business for four years.<br>
Olga, along with husband Tom, were founding members of the museum in town. They were charter members of the Smoky Lake Cultural and Heritage Society. She was an active member until her passing. Olga and Tom were a driving force behind Heritage Days, the fund raising functions and the establishment of a museum building to preserve the history and Ukrainian culture of the area.<br>
After working at the nursing home for six years she could see some form of assistance was needed in transporting patients. So Olga set the gears in motion for the community to get a Lions Action Bus. She volunteered her time to raise funds.<br>
She was an active member of the Senior Citizen's Drop-In Centre. She helped with coffee, sold tickets to their functions, and baked for them for years.<br>
Olga enjoyed gardening and travel, bird watching and reading, and spoiling her grandsons, in whose lives she has been an important and special influence. She travelled throughout Canada and the United States. She kept up with her own yard work until her passing. She enjoyed the many birds and animals who lived on or passed through the farm. She also enjoyed doing crosswork, Ukrainian egg painting, and fancy work in her younger years, as well as dressing up for Halloween dances and the Malanka (Ukrainian New Year's). She was proud of her Ukrainian Heritage, and upheld Ukrainian traditions to the very end. <br>

Hazel Jean KYLE
<p>
<a name ="I072641"><b>[I072641]</b></a><br />
Jean Kyle SoRelle (90) of Greeley, Colorado, passed away peacefully on Dec. 29, 2020. Jean was born in Carthage, Texas, on Feb. 15, 1930, to James Robert and Annie (Keeling) Kyle. She graduated from Texas State College for Women with a degree in sociology. Her diploma hung over her washing machine-she would laugh and say thatʼs what she had done with her degree.<br>
While in college, Jean met Carroll V. SoRelle on a blind date. He attended Texas A&M, an all-male university then, and coeds from the two schools often attended events together. While it might not have been love at first sight, it became a forever love. They married in 1951-69  years ago. They lived in Alabama and California before settling in Texas, first in Dumas and then in Amarillo, after Carroll returned from serving in Korea. Jean taught school in Dumas until they had their three children: Carol, Paul and Merrie.<br>
In 1970 they moved to Greeley, where Jean became an active member of Assistance League of Greeley, Chapter CR of PEO, as well as a volunteer at the hospital. She enjoyed playing gin with the "gin ladies" and was always pleased if she was lucky enough to win a couple dollars.<br>
Jean studied her cookbook, which is now held together with a large rubber band, and became a fabulous cook. Having spent 70 years relentlessly trying to feed everyone around her, itʼs no wonder why so many fond memories of her are related to mealtime. Countless beloved family-favorite recipes will be passed down to future generations.<br>
Carroll and Jean loved to travel. They saw many countries and interesting sights all around the world, including Japan, Australia, Africa and South America. One of her last big trips fulfilled a lifelong dream of exploring Ireland. When they first married, Carroll promised to one day take Jean to Hawaii. He kept that promise when they journeyed as "snowbirds" to Hawaii for a month each year. Later, they purchased a home in Rancho Mirage, California, where they wintered with many friends, old and new alike. If you became a friend of theirs, it was for life; most still keep in touch, even after all these years.<br>
Family was Jeanʼs greatest joy. Through the years, she loved to gather-especially at the familyʼs ranch near Chambers Lake-to watch her family grow. She cherished and loved three children, seven grandchildren and an ever-growing number of great-grandchildren. She beautifully exemplified what it means to be a wife, mother, grandmother and great-grandmother.<br>
How do you sum up 90 years of living in a few words? One family member described Jean as having gentle strength, a perfect description of this family matriarch who led by example and who shared her generous and gracious spirit with everyone. She was a lover of hummingbirds, enjoyed a little ice in a chilled glass of chardonnay, and was even known to tamper with dessert if she lost at cards. Her legacy will live on in the hearts of all those who knew and loved her.<br>
Jean is survived by her husband Carroll; daughter Carol (Jim) Pederson; son Paul SoRelle and Debbi Keese; daughter Merrie (Wayne) Foreman; grandchildren Jamie (Brad) Hepps, Cristopher (Crystal) SoRelle, Claire Pederson, Joseph (Katie), Pederson, Derrick (Nikki) Vaclavik, Travis (Jessica) Vaclavik, Austin (Becca) Vaclavik; and 11 great-grandchildren (and counting).<br>

Having begun training as a consultant with small businesses, he returned home to be with his retired mother and uncle, Ted Karhan, in their family home in Sabinsville and established a tax accounting and business consulting office in Westfield and Elkland, where he practiced until his retirement in 2000. He married Bonelyn Lugg in 1979 and moved to Nelson, where he was a member of the Water Authority for the establishment of the new town. He served as Democratic Committeeman in Nelson from 1980 until his death; he was Democratic candidate for Tioga County Treasurer in the early 90s, President of the Northern Tioga School Board for several years, secretary of the Lions Clubs in Westfield and then in Elkland for many years. He was a member of the Advisory Committee for Men Overcoming Violence, and was treasurer until 2005 of the Northern Tier Cultural Alliance. Grateful for seventeen years of sobriety supported by Alcoholics Anonymous, he has spent two evenings a week since 1992 helping to keep meetings in the Cowanesque Valley vibrant for himself and others. In addition to his wife, he is survived by his sister, Mary Lou Kuhl of Rydal Park, PA; brother and sister-in-law, Tony and Rosemarie Lugg of Nelson and their families. He had eleven much-loved nieces and nephews; seven Kuhls, Robert Kuhl of Coudersport, Kathy and Peter Davis, Barbara and Javier Mendoza, Philip and Susan Kuhl, Richard and Laurel Kuhl, Nancy and Greg Dillett, and Jonathan and Michele Kuhl, and families, all in suburban Philadelphia. The four Luggs are Lisa Guthrie of Mansfield, Robert M. and Jasmine Lugg of Portland, OR, Lenore and Michael Schmitt of Aurora, CO, and families, and Anne Lugg of Kutztown, PA. There are thirty great- and great-great-nieces and nephews.
