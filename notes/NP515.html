William Bernard STAVINOHA
<p>
<a name ="I119366"><b>[I119366]</b></a><br />
William B. Stavinoha, Ph.D., loving husband, father and grandad, scientist and friend, passed away on Sunday, March 28th, 2021. Bill was born in 1928 to Lillian and A.A. Stavinoha in Temple, Texas. Growing up, he visited his grandmother's ranch outside Temple every Sunday with his parents and his sister Marguerite. He maintained a strong love of that land until the end of his life. His Czech family came to central Texas in the 1850s, avoided the Civil War, and farmed for now 170 years. After graduating as valedictorian from Temple High School in 1945, Bill studied at Temple College and then University of Texas at Austin, earning a bachelor and masters degree in Pharmacy. He volunteered for the Army and served as a pharmacist in California during the Korean War. After working in San Marcos, Austin and Belton pharmacies, he completed his doctorate in Pharmacology at University of Texas Medical Branch at Galveston in 1959. He enjoyed a long research career, beginning at Galveston, moving to the FAA/CAMI in Oklahoma City, teaching at the University of Oklahoma College of Pharmacy, and culminating at University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio, where he was a founding basic science faculty member and researcher from 1968 until his retirement in 2000. During his career, he was named distinguished graduate at both UT Pharmacy school and UTMB graduate school. He married Karen Peterson in 1958 and they had a daughter, Anna Christa. After Karen's death in 1965, he married Marilyn Cole in 1967, to whom he was married to for 54 years and together they had daughters Shannon, Elena, and Rose. His doctoral research on thallium began as a response to a public health request for assistance at UTMB. His work was instrumental in saving children and crop-dusters being inadvertently poisoned in Corpus Christi. He later accomplished the first sensitive accurate chemical assay for acetylcholine. He built the first microwave instrumentation for neurochemistry research, allowing the first accurate measurement of many enzymatically labile compounds (choline, acetylcholine, high energy phosphates, cyclic AMP). He brought the first mass spectrometer to UTHSCSA and enjoyed hosting visiting scientists who wanted to use it. He studied sleep; the use of caffeine to delay gravity-induced loss of consciousness in astronauts; and used pharmocognosy to understand anti-inflammatory and anxiolytic properties of South American, Japanese and Korean folk medicines (e.g. Ganaderma lucidum and others). He loved science, architecture, books, dogs, flowers and plants, views of water, family, and friends in various parts of the world. He enjoyed his many friends and acquaintances he knew through the First Unitarian Universalist Church of San Antonio, where his beliefs were shared. Bill was preceded in death by his sister, Marguerite Caesar and her husband Ralph Caesar. Bill will be missed by his wife, Marilyn; daughters Anna Christa and husband Justin, Shannon and husband Michael, Elena, husband Chris, and grandchildren Cole, Phoebe and Max William, Rose, wife Allison, and grandchildren Jensen and Piper. He is also survived by numerous beloved nieces and nephews. A celebration of Bill's life will be scheduled at the First Unitarian Universalist Church of San Antonio at a time when it is safe to gather.<br>

Teaching was her life, wanting everyone to be educated. After marrying and having her two children, she continued her education at Acadia University and received both her B.A. and B.Ed. She continued on with her studies attending almost all of the Maritime universities, including U.N.B., Dalhousie, St. Anne's, Mt. Allison, Mount Saint Vincent and St. Francis Xavier, never losing her quest for knowledge, and completed her education with an additional B.Sc. and Master's Equivalent Program.

She participated in many organizations, including Berwick Baptist Church MacPherson Auxiliary, Allied Youth, Faith Tabernacle United Pentecostal Church, Berwick, and Berwick Seniors. Her love of gardens and flowers stands to her testament to this day, with glorious tulips in bloom, to be followed soon by daffodils, peonies, lilacs, magnolias, lilies and many more. She delighted in visits from her former students and cherished the memory of all her former colleagues. Her life was joyfully extended after the death of her husband by loving, caring friends and caregivers like Dianne Jones, Doug Pelton and Bonnie Baker, without whom she would not have thrived.
