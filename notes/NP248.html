Benjamin Barrett HINCKLEY
<p>
<a name ="I118397"><b>[I118397]</b></a><br />
Benjamin Barrett Hinckley Jr. died in his sleep on July 19, 2004, in Clemens, N.C. He was born on March 3, 1913, in Norhampton, Mass., the son of Benjamin Barrett Hinckley and Agnes Childs Hinckley.<br>
As a child of 11, Ben was sent to Eaglebrook School for Boys in Deerfield, Mass. He graduated from The Choate School in Wallingford, Conn., and attended Yale University. Ben started out on a career as an innkeeper, first assisting his family at their home "The Manse" in Northampton, then at the family's summer home, "The Moorings" in Manset. While looking for a place to manage in the winter, he accepted a job at the Hobkirk Inn in Camden, S.C., where he met Alice Witherspoon DePass. After a brief courtship, Ben and Alice married in May of 1937. Along with Alice came her son, John Ferguson, who was to be their only child. Ben and Alice made their home in Maine, first in Ellsworth and finally for 40 years in Southwest Harbor. Feeling the need for a retirement community, Ben and Alice moved in 1999 to Bermuda Village in Advance, N.C. In their final years, they were lovingly attended by Alice's nephews and their wives, Bob and Rosina Stephenson and Jim and Marcy Allen. During World War II, Ben's brother, Henry R. Hinckley, was engaged at the Manset Boat Yard, in building boats for the U.S. Army and U.S. Navy. Ben joined with his brother in what was to be a partnership of nearly 40 years. Ben, being a more prudent and introspective man, tended to the details of running the business, while Henry oversaw the running of the yard and the boat building. Later, the Manset Boat Yard became the Henry R. Hinckley Co. with Henry at the helm and Ben as treasurer. After the war, Ben took over the operations of Ellsworth Builders Supply. Later, when he sold Ellsworth Builders, he retained ownership of its lumber operation, Wholesale Distributors. Ben went on to found the Hinckley Insurance Agency and, with Henry's son, Bob Hinckley, he co-founded Hinckley Yacht Brokerage.<br>
Widely respected in the community, Ben gave selflessly of his time, serving on many local boards and committees. One of the founders of Maine Coast Memorial Hospital in Ellsworth, he served as vice president or board chair from 1947 to 1980. He also served on the board of Liberty National Bank. Ben was a member of the Pot and Kettle Club in Bar Harbor, the Causeway Club in Southwest Harbor, and the Yale Club. He was a founding member of the Kinfolk Paddle Club. An avid tennis player, his consistent and accurate style on the court fooled many a stronger and faster opponent. He was always in demand as a doubles partner, and posted many Causeway Club wins in mixed doubles. In later years, Ben undertook the enormous job of writing the history of the Hinckley Company from his personal viewpoint. This wonderful narrative, "The Hinckley Story," was published in 1997. Having no children of his own, Uncle Ben took great pride and interest in the accomplishments of his and Alice's nieces and nephews. He never tired of their stories, and he remembered every detail of their lives. Ben will always be remembered for his fastidious attention to detail, his beautifully descriptive hand-written letters, his bow ties and tweed jackets, his warmth and humor and the twinkle in his eye. He was the penultimate gentleman.<br>
In addition to his parents, Ben was predeceased by his wife, Alice DePass Hinckley in 2002; his stepson, John Witherspoon Ferguson in 1998; two brothers, George Lyman Hinckley and Henry Rose Hinckley; and a sister, France Hinckley Templeton. He will be sorely missed by his many nieces and nephews.<br>

<p>
<a name ="I118456"><b>[I118456]</b></a><br />
Frederic Close Towers died at his home in Naples, Florida on January 20, 2016. Born in Washington, DC on January 9, 1934, he was a graduate of St. Albans School in Washington, DC, Williams College and Harvard Business School. He served in the US Navy, first as an intelligence officer with the seventh fleet, and later as aide to CNO Admiral Arleigh Burke.<br>
Affectionately called Freddy by family and friends, he will be remembered for his engaging smile, generous spirit, love of life and his caring nature. He was an enthusiastic sailor, lover of choral music, and model trains. He was an innovator and had an insatiable curiosity about new technology, and he tried to learn something new every day.<br>
In 1958, he married Kay Heffernan. Freddy and Kay were known for their warm hospitality. Kay Towers passed away in 2000. They had one son, Frederic Jr., who died in 1979 as the result of an auto accident.<br>
Freddy was one of the first people to write software for the financial services industry. In 1971, while a successful stockbroker at Johnston, Lemon & Company, he decided to explore the use of the computer in his work. He believed that, with the right software, computers could revolutionize the way stocks were valued and tracked. His programs "Valport" and "Hypo" hold two of the first software patents ever issued in the financial services industry and were licensed to major brokerage firms throughout the country.<br>
Freddy was the ambassador of the Great Harbor, bringing everyone on MDI together to race. He was a devoted member of the Northeast Harbor Fleet, the Southwest Harbor Fleet, and a passionate supporter of youth sailing in the Great Harbor. When Freddy and Kay started coming to Maine in the mid 1970s, Freddy took an interest in the IOD Class, and, in 1978, purchased Humlen #10. He was instrumental in reviving the IOD Class and was a driving force in hosting the first World Class Championship in Northeast Harbor in 1984. Many of the current skippers in the IOD Class established a keen interest in the class by crewing for Freddy. He would hand them the helm, compliment them on their ability to skipper the boat, and, at the appropriate moment, encourage them to buy an IOD. He served as chairman of the IOD World Class Association, as chairman of the NEH Fleet race committee for many years, and as Commodore of the Southwest Harbor Fleet. He will be fondly remembered and missed by sailors from around the world.<br>
In 2004, he married Laurel ("Laurie") Chamberlain Hinckley. It was Laurie's father George who taught Freddy how to sail. In 2005, they moved from Maryland to Naples, Florida. As long time summer residents of Maine, they divided their time between homes in Southwest Harbor and Naples. In both communities, they continued the Towers tradition of entertaining family and friends and participating in civic and sporting activities.<br>
Freddy served as chairman of the governing board of St. Albans School, where he endowed the chair in Computer Science. He was a trustee of the Washington Cathedral Choral Society, Arena Stage, and National Maritime Heritage Foundation. He was a member of the Naples Yacht Club, Royal Poinciana Golf Club, Chevy Chase Club, Northeast Harbor Fleet, Southwest Harbor Fleet, Causeway Club and Pot & Kettle Club.<br>
He is survived by his wife, the former Laurie Hinckley, two sisters, Judy Towers Reemtsma and Dorcy Towers Burns, two stepdaughters, Betsy Kersteen Mulligan and Amy Kersteen Breckon, nine nieces and nephews, and two grandchildren.<br>
A Mass of Christian Burial celebrating the life of Fred Towers will be offered at St. William Church in Naples on January 28, 2016. Services in Washington, DC and Southwest Harbor, Maine will be held at a later date. In lieu of flowers, donations may be made to St. Albans School, St. Albans Annual Giving, Mount St. Alban, Washington, DC 20016-5069 or MDI Community Sailing Center, P.O. Box 116, Southwest Harbor, ME 04679.<br>
