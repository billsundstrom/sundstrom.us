Donovan Joseph ECKHARDT
<p>
<a name ="I104289"><b>[I104289]</b></a><br />
Donovan Joseph Eckhardt Age 37, of Gig Harbor, Washington, died peacefully at home on August 24, 2015, after a courageous fight against cancer. Born in Silver Spring, MD, to parents Michael and Karen (Gabruk), Donovan's family moved frequently until settling in Mission Viejo, California. Donovan graduated with honors from Capistrano Valley High School where he proudly rode the bench for the football team, enjoyed show choir and was elected Prom King for the class of 1996. While attending Colorado State University in Fort Collins, CO, Donovan discovered backpacking and developed a life-long love of the natural wilderness and outdoor activities. Dilly-Dally Donovan, as he was affectionately called by his family and friends, was a wanderer at heart and liked to joke that he attended seven colleges over ten years before obtaining his Associates Degree in Fire Science from Santa Ana Community College back home in Southern California. After graduating from the 126th Basic Fire Academy in Santa Ana, Donovan worked for the US Forest Service as a Wildland Fire Fighter in the Deschutes National Forest in Bend, OR. A giant of a man, Donovan was as strong as a bull and had an equally generous and giving heart. He loved adventure and pursued it in places all across the Western United States. Whether at the top of a snow-capped mountain or the bottom of a wind-carved canyon, Donovan was most at home under a starry sky. He loved sunrises and harvest moons and marveled at the miraculous beauty found in wild places. Donovan was proud to be a Firefighter for the City of Renton and a member of the IAFF Renton Firefighters Local 864. He was known for his incredible work ethic, sense of humor, and compassion for the citizens he served. He was living his dream by riding backwards on the engine and loved going to work at the fire house every shift. Donovan married his true love Jamie (Thomson) in 2010. Together they had taken a blind leap and moved to the beautiful Pacific Northwest, settling in Gig Harbor. Donovan loved the historic fishing village where they made their home together. Donovan and Jamie had a beautiful marriage and happy life together. They were the best of friends and devoted to each other. They loved to celebrate even the most ordinary occasions and took great pleasure in discovering new places together. Their young son William is a chip off the old block the image of his daddy in both appearance and gentle temperament. Donovan did not survive to meet his newborn daughter, who is expected to be born in early September. Donovan is preceded in death by his father, Michael. He is survived by his wife Jamie, son William, and expected daughter as well as his loving mother Karen and brother Gannon (Brooke) of San Clemente, CA. Donovan loved spending time with his family and cherished many memories of glorious summers in North Carolina and snowy winters in Michigan. He was fortunate to have a strong circle of friends and was loved by all who knew him. The Eckhardt family would like to thank the caring physicians and staff at MultiCare Regional Cancer Center in Gig Harbor, MultiCare Hospice, and the Seattle Cancer Care Alliance for their tremendous support throughout his treatment. Additionally, we are grateful to fraternal support from Renton Firefighters Local 864 and to the members of Lionhardt, a foundation created in Donovan's honor to support firefighters battling cancer and terminal illness. A traditional Fire Fighter memorial service is planned for September 25th at 1:00 p.m. at New Life Church in Renton, WA.  A service for family and friends is planned for September 26th at Cedar Creek Farm, a private residence in Gig Harbor. For details please contact djememorial@@gmail.com. In lieu of flowers, Memorial Donations may be made in honor of Donovan to the Southern Utah Wilderness Alliance.<br>

Charlotte Ann ECKROTH
<p>
<a name ="I052945"><b>[I052945]</b></a><br />
Sister Mary Alice Eckroth, 70, a member of the Benedictine Sisters of Annunciation Monastery, went home to God on April 2, 2007, at the monastery. A Mass of Christian Burial is scheduled for 5 p.m. Wednesday, April 4, at the Chapel of Annunciation Monastery.<br>
Visitation starts at 4 p.m. today at the monastery until the time of the funeral. A wake is scheduled for 7:15 p.m. today at the monastery.<br>
Sister Mary Alice, whose baptismal name was Charlotte Ann, was born on Oct. 5, 1936, in Mandan, the first of four daughters of Gabriel E. and Alice (Larson) Eckroth. Impressed by the Benedictines who taught her at St. Joseph's Grade School in Mandan, and others she met later, she felt a call to become a Benedictine sister. She entered Annunciation Monastery on Dec. 8, 1953, and made monastic profession on July 11, 1955.<br>
She taught the elementary grades for 26 years in schools in Dickinson, Flasher and Mandan. Then she made a career change and for 23 years served in the Health and Information Management Department at St. Alexius Medical Center.<br>
An adventurous person, Sister Mary Alice had a great love for nature. She found joy in being outdoors, whether it was camping, hiking, fishing, bird watching, horseback riding, or gardening. This deep appreciation for creation brought her close to God.<br>
Also dear to her heart was the Native American culture. While exploring the prairies of North Dakota, she searched for Native American artifacts and medicine wheels. She often invited friends to go with her to powwows so they could experience the richness of the culture. Sister Mary Alice learned the craft of bead work and enjoyed teaching religion to children at the United Tribes Technical College. She relished telling about her adventures in exploring the land and of her childhood days.<br>
Sister Mary Alice was an unassuming person with a heart of gold. She was generous with her time, had kind words for everyone, and was so grateful for what people did for her especially during her last illness.<br>
She was a woman loved by many people, especially her co-workers at St. Alexius Medical Center. The most precious gift she gave them was that she prayed for them. She reminded them of God and the power of prayer. When one thinks of Sister Mary Alice, two phrases come to mind which she said frequently, "God bless you" and "I will pray for you"; and she meant what she said.<br>
She is survived by her mother, Alice Eckroth, Ellendale; two sisters, Margaret (Henry) Lebak, Bismarck, and Ruth (Orlin) Hartman, Monango; her nieces and nephews; and the Sisters of Annunciation Monastery.<br>
She was preceded into eternal life by her father, Gabriel; and her sister, Jean Heinert.<br>

Lenore Ruth Eckstein<br>
August 3, 1926 - February 4, 2016<br>
Sadly, Lenore Eckstein lost her battle with cancer on February 4, 2016 surrounded by family at home. She was 89 years old and will be greatly missed.<br>
She was born Lenore Ruth Peterson and was raised in Long Beach in a family of Swedish immigrants. After high school graduation, she met her husband, Oscar Eckstein, who was serving in the US Navy. They married and settled in his hometown of San Jose. When her husband died suddenly in a military air crash, Lenore became a widow at age 24 with two young daughters. She never remarried.<br>
With tremendous courage and strength, Lenore decided to stay in San Jose and build a full life. People were drawn to her humor, flair for the dramatic and the twinkle in her eye. In retirement, she moved to Rancho Mirage and embraced the Southwestern desert for over 25 years. In 2004, to be closer to her family, she relocated to Santa Cruz. <br>
She was a lifelong social bridge player, a sought-after fortune-teller, and an unconventional home decorator. She did things her way, never seeking advice from friends or family. She loved Hollywood movies, theater, books, baseball, story telling, lighthouses, boats, American Indian Culture, rodeos, and hot air balloons. <br>
Her greatest pride and joy, however, was her family. She leaves her two daughters, Hannah Eckstein and Robin Lasser, her two granddaughters, Allison Lasser and Jennifer Zeszut, her son-in-law Sam Zeszut, and her three great-grandchildren, Fiona, Rowan, and Henry Zeszut, all of Santa Cruz.<br>
A celebration of her life will be held at Villa Santa Cruz Clubhouse (2435 Felt Street) in Santa Cruz on Sunday, February 28 from 2 pm - 5 pm. <br>

Cunedda ap EDERN
<p>
<a name ="I008722"><b>[I008722]</b></a><br />
From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia.<br>
<br>
Cunedda ap Edern (c.AD 386-c.460; reigned from the 440s or 450s) (Latin: Cunetacius; English: Kenneth), also known as as Cunedda Wledig ('the Imperator'), was an important early Welsh leader, and the progenitor of the royal dynasty of Gwynedd.<br>
<br>
The name 'Cunedda' derives from the Brythonic word counodagos, meaning 'good lord'. His genealogy is traced back to Padarn Beisrudd, which literally translated as Paternus of the Scarlet Robe. One traditional interpretation identifies Padarn as a Roman (or Romano-British) official of reasonably high rank who had been placed in command of Votadini troops stationed in the Clackmannanshire region of Scotland in the 380s or earlier by the Emperor Magnus Maximus. Alternatively, he may have been a frontier chieftain who was granted Roman military rank, a practice attested elsewhere along the empire's borders at the time. In all likelihood, Padarn's command in Scotland was assumed after his death by his son, Edern (in Latin, Aeturnus), and then passed to Edern's son, Cunedda.<br>
<br>
Cunedda and his forebears led the Votadini against Pictish and Irish incursions south of Hadrian's Wall. Sometime after this, the Votadini troops under Cunedda relocated to North Wales in order to defend the region from Irish invasion. Cunedda established himself in Wales, in the territory of the Venedotians, which would become the centre of the kingdom of Gwynedd. Two explanations for these actions have been suggested: either Cunedda was acting under the orders of Maximus (or Maximus's successors) or Vortigern, the high king of the British in the immediate post-Roman era. The range of dates (suggested by PC Bartrum) runs from the late 370s, which would favor Maximus, to the late 440s, which would favor Vortigern.<br>
<br>
The suggestion that Cunedda was operating under instructions from Rome has been challenged by several historians. David Dumville dismisses the whole concept of transplanting foederati from Scotland to Wales in this manner, especially given the political state of sub-Roman Britain which may not have been able to exhibit such centralised control by the fifth century. As Maximus himself was dead by the end of 388, and Constantine III departed from Britain with the last of Rome's military forces in 407, less than a generation later, it is doubtful that Rome had much direct influence over the military actions of the Votadini, either through Maximus or any other emissary, for any significant length of time.<br>
<br>
Maximus (or his successors) may have handed over control of the British frontiers to local chieftains at an earlier date; with the evacuation of the fort at Chester (which Mike Ashley, incidentally, argues is most likely where Cunedda established his initial base in the region, some years later) in the 370s, he may have little option. Given that the archaeological record demonstrates Irish settlement on the Lleyn peninsula however and possible raids as far west as Wroxeter by the late 4th century, it is difficult to conceive of either Roman or allied British forces having presented an effective defence in Wales.<br>
<br>
Academics such as Sheppard Frere have argued that it may have been Vortigern who, adopting elements of Roman statecraft, moved the Votadini south, just as he invited Saxon settlers to protect other parts of the island. According to this version of events, Vortigern would have instructed Cunedda and his Votadini subjects to move to Wales in response to the aforementioned Irish incursions no later than the year 442, when Vortigern's former Saxon allies rebelled against his rule.<br>
<br>
Cunedda's supposed grandson Maelgwn Hir ap Cadwallon was a contemporary of Gildas, and according to the Annales Cambriae died in 547. The reliability of early Welsh genealogies is not uncontested however, and many of the claims regarding the number and identity of Cunedda's heirs did not surface until as late as the 10th century. Nonetheless, if we accept this information as valid, calculating back from this date suggests the mid-5th century interpretation.<br>
<br>
Of Cunedda personally even less is known. Probably celebrated for his strength, courage, and ability to rally the beleaguered Romano-British forces of the region, he eventually secured a politically advantageous marriage to Gwawl, daughter of Coel Hen, the Romano-British ruler of Eboracum (modern York), and is claimed to have had nine sons. Cardigan (Welsh: Ceredigion) and Merioneth (Welsh: Meirionydd) were supposedly named after his two sons Ceredig and Meirion.<br>

<br>
Gregory Egerden, son of Richard Egerden and his first wife, Tamson, was born in Brook, County Kent probably in September or October 1571.  He was christened at the Brook Parish Church on October 8, 1571 [BPR, pg. 6]. Gregory lived in the village of Brook his entire life, and like his father, followed the tannerʼs trade.  Gregory was active in the Brook Parish Church and served both as a "Sideman" (1598) and a churchwarden (1600, 1602) [BPR, pp. 31, 34, 35].  Gregoryʼs marriage was recorded in the Brook Parish Registers as follows:  "Gregorie Egerdon and Elisabeth [---]don were married the third day of februarye 1596" [BPR, pg. 28]. Unfortunately, a blot obliterates much of Elizabethʼs surname.  (The first letter appears to be an "E" or a "C" and the last three letters are clearly "don"; three or four letters in between are entirely illegible.)<br>
<br>
Gregory and Elizabeth Egerden had five known children:<br>
<br>
1. RICHARD, christened at the Brook Parish Church on August 21, 1597 [BPR, pg. 29].<br>
<br>
2. JOHN, christened at the Brook Parish Church on January 20, 1599/1600 [BPR, pg. 32].<br>
<br>
3. ELIZABETH, christened at the Brook Parish Church on June 3, 1604 [BPR, pg. 37]<br>
<br>
4. JANE, married Henry Knight.<br>
<br>
5. GREGORY, christened at the Brook Parish Church on February 9, 1614/5 [BPR, pg. 48],<br>
    and buried there on February 16, 1614/5 [BPR, pg. 48].<br>
<br>
Gregory Egerden died in the village of Brook, County Kent in August of 1618, and was buried there on August 16th of that year [BPR, pg. 51].  He left a Last Will and Testament, dated August 15, 1618, which was proved on September 5, 1618 [see Canterbury Probate Records. Archdeaconry Court: Register of Wills. Vol. 56, 1605 - 1618; pp. 73 - 74, FHL #0188954]. Gregoryʼs will mentioned the following heirs:  "Elizabeth my wyfe", "my soone Richard Egerden", "my soone John Egerden", "Elizabeth Egerden my daughter", and "Jane my daughter".  No record has been found of the burial of Gregoryʼs wife, Elizabeth.<br>
