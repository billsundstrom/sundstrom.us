Milcolm Fitch JESS
<p>
<a name ="I035771"><b>[I035771]</b></a><br />
Malcolm Fitch Jess - 65, of East Hall's Harbour, Kings County. Malcolm departed this life on the 20th of January, 2011 at the ancestral family farm in East Hall's Harbour, Nova Scotia. The son of Cecil and Betty Jess, Malcolm was born September 15, 1945 in Kentville, Nova Scotia. Malcolm took an early leave of high school to take over the operation and eventual ownership of the family farm, improving and expanding it while also finding employment and eventually becoming a plant foreman at the Hostess Foods processing plant. As custodian of the family farm, he and his wife Sally served as the anchors of the extended family, including giving final care to our mother Elizabeth. Indirectly or acting in concert with Sally, Malcolm made generous contributions of time and resources to his community and his extended family. He loved to study the Bible, world history and to dabble in the stock market. His major disappointment in life concerned the uphill struggle he waged to maintain the family farm in the face of world trends that successively destroyed most of the surrounding farms and his markets, making it increasingly difficult to survive as a farmer. As a young man he was remarkable for his strength, coordination and physical beauty. All his life he derived great joy from the care and riding of horses, while exhibiting superlative skill in the operation of vehicles and heavy farm machinery. He is survived by Sally (nee Davison) Jess, his partner and wife of the past 30 years, who faithfully nursed him through his long and courageous battle with lung cancer. Malcolm is the father of five surviving children, Robert Jess (daughter-in-law, Margie Brown); Gay Best (son-in-law, Stephen, grandsons, Joseph, Nicholas and granddaughter, Salene); Tracy Foote (son-in-law, Radford); Jennifer Jess (grandson, Corey) and Sandra Dorman of Moose Jaw, SK; (son-in-law; Shawn, granddaughters, Sophia and Jessah). He is survived by five siblings, Cameron (with sister-in-law, Linda, parents of nephew, Holden and niece, Gaea); Brenda Dewar of Brockville, Ontario (with brother-in-law, Tom, parents of nephew, Duncan and niece, Katherine); Sandra Sweeney of Palm Coast, Florida (with brother-in-law, David, parents of nephews, Scotty, David Jr. and Randy); Wanda Jess and Kevin Jess (with sister-in-law, Sheila, parents of nieces, Meghan, Hillary and nephew, Malachi). He is also survived by his mother-in-law, Mary Davison, his brother-in-law, Raymond Davison and sister-in-law, Sharon with their children, Joey and Sarah. Malcolm is predeceased by his parents, Cecil Royce Jess and Elizabeth Ann (nee Fitch) Jess and his father-in-law, Paul Raymond Davison. Cremation has taken place under the direction of the White Family Funeral Home and Cremation Services, Kentville. The funeral service, followed by a reception, was held at 11:00 a.m. Monday, January 24, 2011 in the White Family Funeral Home, Kentville. Donations in memory may be made to the Annapolis Valley Victorian Order of Nurses, the Hall's Harbour Volunteer Fire Department or the charity of your choice. Funeral arrangements have been entrusted to the White Family Funeral Home and Cremation Services, Kentville. On-line inquiries may be directed to www.whitefamilyfuneralhome.com.<br>

Mary Frances JETT

<a name ="I103589"><b>[I103589]</b></a><br />
March 26, 1946 to August 6, 2014 <br>
It is with great sadness our family must share the passing of Mary Frances Jett on August 6, 2014 in her Los Altos home. Mary Fran was born in Hollywood, California to parents Bob and Janet Jett. She grew up in San Marino, California graduating from San Marino High school in 1964. Mary Fran attended Vanderbilt University in Nashville, Tennessee earning both her Bachelor of Science in Nursing and her PhD in Physiology.<br>
She moved to Brussels, Belgium to complete her post doctoral work. Mary Fran returned to Vanderbilt to pursue her passion for academia and research as a professor of Graduate Nurses for many years. She continued this work at University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia for 5 years. Mary Fran began her professional career in the Silicon Valley at Syntex, later acquired by Roche, a Swiss Pharmaceutical company. While at Roche, she worked as a Bioscientist and mid level manager in both the Analgesic and Gastrointestinal areas. <br>
Following Mary Franʼs retirement, she remained very involved in her local Los Altos community. She was a member of St. Bedeʼs Episcopal Church where she held different leadership roles. She devoted her whole heart to the St. Bedeʼs Altar Guild and the St. Bedeʼs Investment Club. She also participated in The Morning Forum of Los Altos and "Le Group Francais." Mary Fran forged life long friendships in her cul-de-sac neighborhood where she enjoyed planning their annual summer block party and sharing her homegrown apples and oranges. She also loved gardening, "refreshing" the interior of her home, redesigning the backyard, and walking with friends. Cooking was a favorite pastime, especially family recipes like cranberry steamed pudding at Christmas time. Mary Fran played bridge and even challenged herself by taking business courses at the community college.<br>
Mary Fran will be remembered as an amazing woman of faith, who pursued academic excellence, approached life with intellectual curiosity, showed compassion towards others and displayed a deep love for her family. Mary Fran is survived by brother David Hamilton Jett of Hilo, Hawaii; sister Kathie King and husband Jim King of Redding, California; nephew Justin Hamilton King of Redding, California; sister Mardi Jett Frum and husband Jeffery Ward Frum and nieces Lauren Leigh Frum and Jenna Leigh Frum all of Newport Beach, California. We will be celebrating Mary Franʼs life and legacy on Saturday September 20th at 2:00 PM at St. Bedeʼs Episcopal Church, 2650 Sand Hill Road, Menlo Park, 94025 with a reception following in the courtyard. In lieu of flowers, please consider a donation to the Jeffery Robert Frum Endowed Scholarship at Pitzer College, a member of the Claremont Colleges, established by Mary Fran for her nephew in 2013.<br>

In a letter, dated June 8, 1949,  to the heirs of Maurtiz Johnson, Ann Marie Sundstrom, a niece, sent the following information.  " He was employed by the Kosmos Timber Company of Komos, Washington and earned a salary of $3,388.56 for 11 months in 1948, after which time he was apparently unemployed. His social security records show earnings of over $3,000.00 a year for several years but aparently he carried no insurance nor had any bank accounts.<br>
<br>
He died on March 3rd in a T.B. Sanatoriam which he had entered one week before he died and cause of death was tuberculosis. I called the coronor at Seattle and talked to him and he said he entered the hospital in the last stages of tuberculosis. I authorized cremation since there was no one out there to take care of a grave. The ashes are buried at the Riverton Crest Cemetery, 6-9-L.<br>
<br>
The funeral expenses were $170.88, the amount of cash he had when he died."<br>
<br>
She also stated that she was reimburshed for this sum by Social Security, recieved an Unemployment Compensation check of $22.00 and after expenses of $22.85 for telephone and telegraph charges, had a balance $173.03 for the heirs. Signed, Ann M. Sundstrom, 5455 Sunnyside Ave., Chicago, Ill.<br>
