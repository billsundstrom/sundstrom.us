Daisy Amelia SMITH
<p>
<a name ="I020994"><b>[I020994]</b></a><br />
On Daisy's marriage record, she is Daisy 'Ward'.  Daisy lists her parents as Edward and Mary, although the 1901 census lists her as their granddaughter, (last name Smith) so I would guess Edward and Mary must have raised her so she considered them her parents. Or possibly she did not know they weren't. Her birth mother was a child Wilemina Smith, a daughter of Mary Smith's first marriage.  Wilemina was the informant on her death certificate, where the name of  Daisy's father is found. <br>
