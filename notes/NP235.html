Albion man dies in Lake Ontario SHERIFF: <br>
Rough waters left two exposed to elements nine miles north of Point Breeze<br>
A man died Saturday after the boat he and another man were using sank in rough waters in Lake Ontario, Orleans County sheriff's deputies said.<br>
The deceased was identified Sunday as Carl F. Hazel , 66, of Albion.<br>
Details were provided by the survivor and responders were transported to where the men had been lost in the water for at least two hours before being recovered.<br>
The men were fishing in 500-foot deep waters about nine miles off the shoreline when waves reaching five to seven feet crashed over the boat, which took on water and sank, Sheriff Randall Bower said in a statement Saturday. That would place them about as far north from Point Breeze as the lakeshore hamlet is from the village of Albion.<br>
An investigation into the sinking is underway, with both the Orleans and Niagara County Sheriff's Offices taking part.<br>
According to initial reports, both men were wearing life jackets at the time, and were able to communicate with one another for a short period of time. They were unable to stay together in the rough waters.<br>
Exposed to the elements, they floated apart until being spotted by a Canadian freighter. The U.S. Coast Guard and its Canadian counterpart were notified, with the first call to the Orleans County 911 Center arriving shortly after 11:30 a.m. Both men had been recovered by then, with Hazel unresponsive and his companion able to talk despite being in shock from the trauma.<br>
Officers from the Orleans County Sheriff's marine enforcement unit and two COVA medics responded, taking the Sheriff's Marine One boat to meet a responding USCG cutter approximately five miles north of Point Breeze. Attempts to save Hazel 's life were unsuccessful, and the Coast Guard transported his body to the marina.<br>
The surviving boater was rescued by a private fishing vessel from Ohio, and was also transported to Lake Breeze marina. He was treated for exposure to the cold water and released.<br>
Bower thanked the assistance of the U.S. and Canadian Coast Guards, the Olcott Fire Rescue Boat, COVA Ambulance, Carlton Fire Department and others who assisted in the response.<br>

Harold Matthew HAZEL
<p>
<a name ="I106313"><b>[I106313]</b></a><br />
On December 10, 2006, Harold Mathew Hazel passed away after a 10 year struggle with Alzheimer's disease. He was known to his family and friends as Hal. Born in Lakewood, Ohio, he grew up on a farm during the Great Depression. As a boy he loved to swim in the summer and skate and sled in the winter. When WWII broke out he joined the Army. He trained countless recruits how to swim at the pool at Schofield barracks. After the war he met and married Betty Reese Coffey. Their love lasted 49 years. Under the G.I. bill, he earned a degree in Mechanical engineering from Case Institute in Cleveland. Following school, the couple moved to Arizona to get away from the snow where he and Betty Reese raised their two boys, Bruce and Scott. Hal worked at Garrett Air Research as an Aerospace Engineer for the next 32 years. In retirement, he started the Phoenix chapter of the American Aviation Historical Society as well and the Garrett Air Research Retirees Club. He also enjoyed spending time with his two grandsons, Chris and Gary. He lost the love of his life in 1995 and his oldest son in 1998. These losses took a toll on his body, mind and mostly his spirit. In recent years, Hal moved to San Diego to be closer to family. He had a life-long love of airplanes and enjoyed attending air shows with his family and friends. With regards to politics, he always considered himself a Barry Goldwater Republican. Hal was involved in all of the best things in life. He was a good son, husband, father, and grandfather. He was a good provider for his family. His values anchored the lives of his family and friends. He was a good example to his sons and grandsons. We will miss his physical presence in our lives but his spirit will live on with us. Good bye old fellow. A celebration of his life is planned for this spring in Arizona. Hal is survived by his son Scott, daughter-in-law Karen and grandsons Chris and Gary and his many friends. <br>

Two years later she purchased the little home on Emmett street where she passed a peaceful life until the time of her death.<br>
In the year of 1885, she joined the Methodist Episcopal church of Genoa, and since that time has been one who has devoted much time to the work of Christ. She was a lady well thought of in all communities and lived a peaceful life among her many friends. She was the youngest of a family of nine children, and was the last to depart.<br>
She was the mother of five children of whom four are living. They are: Mrs. Lida Anderson, Mrs. C. A. Snow and Edgar H. of Genoa and Geo. W. of dane, Wis.<br>
