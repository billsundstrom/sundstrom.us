Edwin Loyd AKEY
<p>
<a name ="I011681"><b>[I011681]</b></a><br />
Edwin L. Akey, age 80, of Dundas, passed away unexpectedly on Sunday, March 8, 2020, at Abbott Northwestern Hospital in Minneapolis surrounded by his family.<br>
Edwin was born the son of Abner and Stella (Bosnell) Akey on January 30, 1940, in Mosinee, Wisconsin. He began working for a local carnival and traveled to the southern states before enlisting in the United States Army in 1957 where he was decorated as an expert marksman. He served one year in Korea and upon his return completed his service in Farmington. Ed was united in marriage to Marlys Tupper on June 4, 1960, in Little Prairie United Methodist Church. He worked for Farmers Seed for short time and later took a position at Carleton College where he worked in the agriculture barn. He was employed by Northfield Foundry, manufacturing commercial woodworking equipment. He then began working for Malt O Meal in the Ames Mill Plant on the shell machine and continued employment there for 25+years. Edwin retired in 1999. During that time, he also farmed in Dundas.<br>
Edwin was the kind of guy that was quick with a joke and even quicker wit. When he wasn ºt wrapped up in a good book or game of cards he could be found tinkering in the shop, working in the garden, or in his favorite place in the world, the woods behind the farm. Hunting for mushrooms, making maple syrup, cutting firewood, or his favorite deer hunting. He was a caring and amazing grandpa that followed his grandchildren to any activities they were involved in. Ed was an easy-going man and full of compassion for others. He loved giving people a hard time but always in lite hearted fashion. The things that meant the most to him in the world were people, especially his family.<br>
He is survived by his wife Marlys of Dundas; daughter Deb (Peter) Little of Dundas; son Bruce Akey of Dundas; four grandchildren Aaron (Melissa) Little of Dundas, Derek (Erin) Little of Colman, SD, Hailey Akey of Dundas, Alex Akey of Dundas; two great-grandchildren Brody and Ali Little; a sister-in-law Pat (Dale) Soberg of Shakopee and many nieces and nephews. He was preceded in death by his parents, his mother and father-in-law Lloyd and Ethel Tupper and all his siblings.<br>
Visitation will be at Little Prairie United Methodist Church on Thursday, March 12, 2020, from 4:00 PM to 7:00 PM and one hour prior to the service in the church. Funeral services will be at Little Prairie United Methodist Church on Friday, March 13, 2020, beginning at 11:00 AM with the Reverend Ed DuBose officiating.

Jenny Faye ALBORELL
<p>
<a name ="I081099"><b>[I081099]</b></a><br />
Jenny Faye Brodersen (Nee Alborell) March 11, 2007 age 82 of Bloomfield Hills. Beloved wife of Hardy G. Dear mother of Christopher (Regina) and Elisabeth Brovold (William). Grandmother of Thor Brovold, Kai Brodersen , and Gustav Brovold. Also survived by several nieces and nephews. Memorial service Saturday April 14th 11:00 a.m. at A.J.

In lieu of flowers family suggests memorial tributes to Cranbrook Educational Community, Cranbrook Academy of Art.<br>
The Detroit News,  11 April 2007<br>
-------------------------------<br>
Jenny Faye Alborell was born in the upstairs bedroom of a house on Spokane Avenue in Detroit, to parents Frankie Hazel Hoisington and Talbert Lewis Alborell.<br>
Her early childhood was spent in East Lansing in a grand house on MAC (Michigan Agricultural College) Avenue, complete with a barn, stables, pigeons, rabbits, and a mastiff named Cap. Her father was a CPA and a former Comptroller of the Ternstedt Division of General Motors who had a general practice in Detroit. He drove daily to Detroit in a Cadillac touring car, and his arrival at the end of the day was eagerly awaited, announced at the gate with the honk of a horn.<br>
Jenny Faye ºs mother was Frankie Hazel Hoisington, born in Pomona, California. Frankie met her future husband at Universal Studios, where she worked as a cashier at the commissary, and mingled daily with such luminaries as Mary Pickford and Douglas Fairbanks.<br>
Jenny Faye had three siblings, the oldest being Hugh, who was five years older, then Donald, who was three years older, and finally younger sister Frankie, who was five years younger.<br>
With the advent of the Depression in the 1930s, the family moved to Pennsylvania Avenue on the West Side of Detroit. She often spoke of her ice skating until dusk, on the ice rinks at Northwestern High School on West Grand Boulevard.<br>
Jenny Faye attended Cass Technical High School, which necessitated a bus ride with three changes to and from school. She graduated with high honors, marred only by one lesser grade in chemistry, a blemish that continued to bother her many years later. Her major was Costume Illustration, a three year course that prepared her to enter the profession upon graduation. Despite the name, the course work included instruction in all phases of art, and she became accomplished in design, composition, still life and figure drawing, portraiture, painting in oils and watercolor, printmaking, and illustration with pastel, pen and ink and gouache.<br>
She was one of the great beauties at Cass, long hair brushed straight, a trend-setter in fashion. The social life at Cass was not elegant during the war years, with an occasional dance after school in the gym. It was at one of these that Hardy sent Jack Bright over to Jenny Faye to tell her that there was a guy who was interested in meeting her. As the saying goes, the rest is history.<br>
Hardy and Jenny would meet daily before class at Nick ºs Diner, a greasy spoon across the street from Cass, over coffee and cigarettes.<br>
They graduated in 1942. She went to New York on a scholarship to the Franklin School of Design. He attended the Cranbrook Academy of Art for a brief half-year before being drafted. Then she was called home from New York, her father ºs health was failing, and with two brothers in the service, her mother and younger sister needed help.<br>
It was during the war years in Detroit that Jenny Faye began her professional career and built her reputation as an advertising artist. At Jam Handy under Max Fleisher she worked as an illustrator and animator, creating training films for the Navy. At Allied Artists, she worked under her mentor and promoter Jim Donahue, where she illustrated ads for nationally-circulated magazines, including the Ford Times. One such ad campaign was the series for Gillette ("Look sharp, be sharp"), for which she drew the well-known cartoon personality. She exhibited her watercolors regularly at the Michigan Artist ºs Show and won several awards.<br>
Hardy returned home from the war in 1946, and the two were married in June of that year. They spent their honeymoon in a 100-year-old farmhouse on 230 acres in Pinckney, Michigan. The first months on the farm were challenging, with no running water and only the big iron stove in the kitchen for heat. Nevertheless, Jenny always spoke fondly of this time, and how the "simple" life was so much more enjoyable. In the winter of 1947, the two moved to Chicago, where Hardy attended the University of Chicago for a year on the G.I. Bill, and Jenny worked at a local studio. <br>
The next phase of family life began in 1948 with the arrival of Christopher. The family was now living in a small, second-story apartment on Vinewood Avenue in Detroit. Hardy had begun working for the George P. Johnson Company in the Decorating Department. One of his first assignments there was to hang banners from the rafters of the State Fair Coliseum. In a very short time he progressed to the position of Production Manager, and the future looked promising. Plans were under way to build a house in the suburbs.<br>
In 1952, the family moved in with Jenny ºs parents on Woodingham Drive in Detroit, her father was ailing and needed round-the-clock care. During this time, Hardy drafted plans for the new house, and construction was begun on a 0.6 acre lot in the Braes of Bloomfield. Jenny ºs father passed away in the spring of 1954, by the end of that year, construction on the new house was nearing completion, and three days after Christmas the family moved into their new home on Walnut Lake Road.<br>
A major snow storm had fallen, and so Jenny and Christopher spent the first few days in the new house "snowed in", unable to go anywhere. In the haste of moving, Jenny had forgotten to pack the silverware, which meant that the first meals in the new house had to be eaten with the fingers.<br>
Already on Woodingham, Jenny had shown her considerable skill in gardening. At the Walnut Lake Road house, there were new opportunities for expansion. Her crowning creation at the new house was a terraced rock garden with numerous wild flowers and a spring-fed pond. Other gardens were built along the lines of a classical English garden, and an oriental indoor pond garden.<br>
In 1956, tired of the isolation caused by the lack of a car, Jenny decided to take driving lessons and acquire her license. Her first car was a 1956 Chevy Belle Aire. This gave her the freedom to pursue new exploits, one of which was the opportunity to teach. She had been invited by Zoltan Sepeshy to teach illustration at The Society of Arts and Crafts (now the College for Creative Studies), and in 1957 she became the first woman to teach at that institution.<br>
In 1958 Jenny decided to take up the classical guitar. She bought a guitar and began taking lessons with a local specialist, Joe Fava. She progressed rapidly, and after a year or so was able to play quite complicated pieces such Ibeniz ºs Asturias and Tarrega ºs Recuerdos de la Alhambra. <br>
Every summer the Brodersens took their family vacation at the Pine Bluff Resort on Lake Michigan, near Montague. It was during these idyllic two-week sojourns that Jenny would venture out to paint watercolors "in situ" of the Lake Michigan countryside. Many luminous watercolors exist from this period, with her favorite subject being the barns and Victorian-era farmhouses in the area.<br>
Another important component of the Brodersen family routine was its tradition of celebrating Christmas. This typically began in early December with a faux "stained glass" window, painstakingly painted by Jenny in water-soluble tempera paint on one of the front windows. The subject was usually one or more angels, often playing a musical instrument. Christmas at the Brodersen household was always filled with music, good food, family and friends, and almost all of it was Jenny ºs doing. <br>
1959 was an auspicious year for the Brodersens, Elisabeth was born, and Hardy founded Design Origins, Inc., which he would lead for nearly thirty years. Jenny ºs duties as wife and mother increased accordingly, while she continued the pursuit of her art and gardening.<br>
Sometime during the early ?~60s, Jenny began her research into the family ºs genealogy. Her contacts gradually extended to all corners of the country and beyond, and required frequent trips to the Burton Library in Detroit, and to areas where her family had lived previously, such as New York State and California. By the end of her life she had amassed an enormous quantity of reference books and research material, and had filled countless pages with documentation of her family ºs lineage. At her death this material remained not compiled; it is the family ºs hope that Jenny ºs research will eventually find its way into the hands of other genealogists, where it can be put to good use.<br>
In 1967, Hardy and Jenny decided to build an addition to the house. This consisted of a larger master bedroom with separate bath, an indoor garden/greenhouse, and a music room. The grand piano in the music room became the focus of many happy gatherings of family and friends.<br>
In later years, Jenny ºs three grandsons were her principal pride and joy. Thor (born 1987), Kai (born 1988) and Gustav (born 1991) spent many happy hours at the house on Walnut Lake Road, and Jenny, now known as "Mimi" to her grandsons and even to the neighbors, unselfishly devoted her attention and energies to their well-being. A photo from the penultimate family gathering in November 2006 shows a proud "Mimi" with her three grandsons, who tower at least two feet above her.<br>
Wonderful, gifted, beautiful, loving wife, mother, mother-in-law, grandmother and friend, we thank you for the love and care you unselfishly lavished on us, for the many memories and good times, for your art, your love of music, and simply for who you were. We love you, we miss you, and we will never forget you.<br>
