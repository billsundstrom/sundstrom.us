Bert Eugene SHERWIN
<p>
<a name ="I064831"><b>[I064831]</b></a><br />
Bert Eugene Sherwin, successfully engaged in farming in Aurora township, was born in Kaneville, Illinois, June 18, 1877, his parents being Daniel C. and Mary E. (Barnes) Sherwin, the former born in Massachusetts, April 8, 1842, and the latter in New York state, June 15, 1842. They removed to Sugar Grove township when our subject was quite young and there carried on agricultural pursuits for several years. In 1885 they took up their abode in Aurora, where the father passed away in 1891. Mrs. Sherwin survived her husband until January 12, 1900, when she, too, was called to her final rest. She was a sister of Crowell and Ethelbert Barnes, prominent farmers of Sugar Grove township, who are mentioned on another page of this volume. Our subject has but one sister, namely Cora A., who was born June 24, 1867, and is the wife of Charles A. Hilderbrand, an agriculturist of Sugar Grove township.<br>
Bert Eugene Sherwin attended school until fourteen years of age in the old brick schoolhouse on the Galena road, two miles west of Aurora. Subsequently he attended the Oak street school in Aurora for three years, and after putting aside his text-books was for a time employed as clerk in a grocery store. Various other occupations claimed his attention until 1900, when he rented the Hoyt farm, now owned by Mrs. Harbour, comprising eighty acres. For eight years he has now successfully managed the place, being a man of untiring perseverance and good business ability.<br>
On the 4th of December, 1900, Mr. Sherwin was united in marriage to Miss Ruby Parker, who was born in Sugar Grove township. April 17, 1881, a daughter of Perry and Mary (Russell) Parker. They have become the parents of five children: Parker Russell, whose birth occurred August 31, 1902; Donald Sidney, born August 25, 1903; Norman B., whose natal day was August 8, 1905; Kenneth, born December 20, 1906; and Beatrice, May 27, 1908.<br>
Politically a stanch Republican, Mr. Sherwin gives stalwart allegiance to the men and measures of that party. Fraternally he is connected with the Modern Woodmen and is also a member of the West Aurora Farmers' Club. He is of a very retiring nature, unassuming and modest, but is nevertheless highly respected throughout the community, being widely known as a man of excellent character and upright life.<br>
