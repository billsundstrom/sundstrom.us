Harry Clifton HARKNESS
<p>
<a name ="I070123"><b>[I070123]</b></a><br />
HARKNESS - Dr. Harry C. Harkness, [SRGP 73635] for many years a physician in Mansfield and vicinity, died at the home of his daughter, Mrs. A.A. Hufford, in Philadelphia, on July 17 [1925], of heart disease. Although he had been in rather poor health for the past two years, he had kept up a rather strenuous practice in Mansfield, says the Advertiser. After the death of his wife about three weeks ago, he went to Philadelphia to visit his daughter, Irene, and get a little rest. He was the son of Mr. & Mrs. Samuel C. Harkness, of Springfield, and was born January 5, 1871. He attended the schools of Springfield and afterward the Mansfield Normal School, from which he graduated in 1891. He taught for one year and then went to Chicago to study medicine, graduating in 1896. He located in Mainesburg, where he built up a lucrative practice, and bought the Dr. Maine drug store, one of the historic spots of the town. He moved to Mansfield in 1914 and had won a wide circle of friends among his patients and others. He married, on June 8, 1898, Esther Campbell, daughter of Mr. & Mrs. George Campbell, of Troy township. To them five children were born: Irene Elizabeth, Gladys Lucinda, who died in infancy, Clifton Campbell, Carlton Samuel and John Dickinson. Dr. Harkness was a member of the Methodist church, Odd Fellows and the Masonic Lodges. He was president of the Mansfield Board of Health and treasurer of the School Board. He was also a member of the Tioga County Medical Society, Tyoga Country Club, Mansfield Sportsmanʼs Club and Jersey Shore and Mainesburg Rod and Gun Club. The latter organization had a camp on Lick Run where Dr. Harkness went every season for hunting and fishing. He was a great lover of the sports. He knew and appreciated a good rifle or shotgun, was well versed in fishing lore, and since joining the country club had become quite interested in golf. But his great interest in life was the practice of medicine, and his patients knew that he gave each individual case deep study and thought. He was deliberate in his judgments whether in the sick room or in a board meeting or among his friends, but all knew that when the decision came it would be a wise one. He was a typical physician, and a thorough Christian gentleman. His going is a blow to the community and his friends will greatly miss him. The funeral was held from his late home Monday at 3 p.m., just three weeks after that of Mrs. Harkness. Rev. F.P. Simmons officiated and the Masons attended in a body and had charge of the burial. The pall bearers were: Dr. Doane of Mansfield; Dr. Col and Dr. Carey of Blossburg; Dr. Vosburg of Arnot; and Drs. Hakes and Smith of Tioga. The business places of Mansfield were closed during the funeral. The floral offerings were many and beautiful. Burial was in Prospect cemetery. Dr. Harkness is survived by his sister, Miss Anna Harkness; his daughter, Mrs. A.A. Hufford, and his sons, Clifton C., Carlton S. and John D. <br>

The son of Danish king Harthaknut, Gorm is one of the most misinterpreted figures in Danish history. Often maligned as a cruel old dotard and a staunch heathen, Gorm was probably born around 910-915, and died in late 958 according to dendrochronological studies of the wood in his burial chamber.<br>
<br>
His ancenstry may lie with the Danish rulers in East Anglia, one of which was named Guthrum, a form of the name Gorm. His father came to Denmark around 916 or 917 and deposed the young king Sigtrygg, and when Harthaknut died, Gorm ascended to the throne. Claims that he took it by force, or that he only ruled part of the peninsula of Jutland are almost certainly erroneous...Gorm's great-great-grandson king Sweyn Estridsson referred to both Gorm and his father as kings of (all of) Denmark, not just parts of the country.<br>
<br>
Gorm was neither old nor unwise; when correctly interpreted, early sources point to him as being open-minded and pragmatic as far as Denmark's relationship with the Christian neighbors to the south was concerned, but earlier historians often confused him with his father who supposedly withstood the coming of Christianity for as long as he lived.<br>
<br>
His skeleton is believed to have been found at the site of the first Christian church of Jelling. During the reign of Gorm, most Danes still worshipped the Norse gods, but during the reign of Gorm's son Harold Bluetooth, Denmark officially converted to Christianity. Harold supposedly moved the skeleton of his father from its original resting place into the church, but left the hill where Gorm had originally been interred as a memorial.<br>
