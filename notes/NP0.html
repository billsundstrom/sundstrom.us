Thomas Nelson H. AAKER
<p>
<a name ="I019158"><b>[I019158]</b></a><br />
Thomas Aaker, a former Twin Cities journalist and business owner, died Friday in Florida at age 67.<br>
Aaker was a reporter in the 1960s for WTCN and KSTP-TV, where he became assistant news director. After leaving television news, he wrote a syndicated newspaper column on state politics.<br>
He also became politically involved after ending his television career. Aaker was a member of the City Council in Crystal from 1977 to 1984 and the city's mayor from 1984 to 1988.<br>
Aaker also served on the board of North Hennepin Community College in the 1980s and was a member of the North Suburban Cable Commission. His work as a newsman earlier prevented him from such community service.<br>
''He reported on public life for so long,'' said his son, Bill Aaker of St. Louis Park. ''Once he was able to, he wanted to do it.''<br>
Aaker and his wife, Marie, founded a clip service that produced transcripts of radio and television news reports for businesses. The company later offered audiotapes and videotapes of news coverage for clients.<br>
Aaker retired in 1994 after a bout of adult respiratory distress and moved to Edgewater, FL, in 1998.<br>
In addition to his wife and son Bill, Aaker is survived by a brother, Tuck of Sarasota, FL; daughters Karen of Plymouth and Ann Marie McCann of Roseville; and sons Steven of Downington, Pa., and Tom of St. Louis Park.<br>
