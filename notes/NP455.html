She was a highly regarded member of the Richardson Bay Yacht Club and the Red Hat Society, whose members valued highly her outgoing and friendly personality. In addition to George, Donna is survived by her mother Monica Loehlein Larson, sister Linda Williams, brothers John Roach, Jr., Robert Roach and Alan Roach, as well as a close knit extended family and 10 nieces and nephews, all of whom feel a great sense of loss at her passing.

LAST RITES FOR RALPH C. ROBBINS<br>
Overlooking the city in which most of the 59 years of his life were spent, Ralph C. Robbins was buried Monday in Highland cemetery with a simple, impressive ceremony. Scores gathered at the services to pay their last respects to a man they had known as a cheerful, kind citizen of Gladwin. The Reverend Lerouy Whitney officiated.<br>
Robbins' sudden death Friday afternoon following a heart attack while he was sleeping at his home was a shock to the community. Apparently in the best of health until that afternoon, he had gone home from his grocery store a little earlier than usual, complaining of a slight pain around his heart. <br>
He died a few minutes after he had gone to sleep. <br>
CAME HER IN '81<br>
Born November 4, 1874 near Mt. Pleasant, he came to Gladwin in 1881 with his parents, Mr. and Mrs. Enoch Robbins, who opened a grocery store near the present site of the Henderson grocery.<br>
After graduating from Gladwin high school Robbins married Maude Black in 1892. After teaching district school for a few years, he went to Idaho, where he was engaged in farming until 1903, when he returned to Gladwin and bought his father's grocery business.<br>
From that date until his death Robbins scarcely missed a day at his business. Among the merchants along the street it was often said that "you can set your watch when Ralph Robbins goes past to work."<br>
LOVER OF SPORTS<br>
A great lover of sports, there was hardly a contest that went on that he missed. He was a great fisherman.<br>
He was a member of the I.O.O.F. For many years he was chairman of the Board of Public Works. Last winter he was superintendent of the CWA sewer project here in Gladwin. <br>
Surviving are his wife; two sons, Kenneth of Pinconning; and Eldon of Detroit; a sister, Mrs. Nettie Deacon; two brothers, Dr. Bernard Robbins of Milwaukee, and Gerald Robbins of Lansing; a hald-sister, Mrs. I. E. Foutch; a half-brother, Enoch Robbins, of Sherman township.<br>
Those from out of town who came for the last rites were: Mr. and Mrs. Kenneth Robbins of Pinconning, Mr.and Mrs. Eldon Robbins of Detroit, Gerald Robbins, Lansing, Dr. Bernard Robbins and daughter, Gwendolyn, of Milwaukee, Wis., Mr. and Mrs. E. L. Good of Pinconning, Dr. and Mrs. Hayden Neely of Detroit, Mrs. Lee Crispen of Lansing, Mr. and Mrs. T. E. Smith and daughter, Barbara, of Manistee, Mr. and Mrs. Freeman Herbison of Jackson, Mr. and Mrs. Frank Ripley of Mt. Pleasant, Mr. and Mrs. A. H. Bradley of Midland. <br>
