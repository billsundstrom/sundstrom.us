William Richard Bremer<br>
William Richard Bremer Bill took the high ground (like a true Marine) when he passed away on December 5, 2005 of cancer at Marin General Hospital. Bill, a fourth generation San Franciscan, was born January 5, 1930. He was the only son of Milton and Alice Bremer (dec.). He was a devoted husband to Margaret Herrington for 46 years, and he loved his family, Mark Richard (dec.), Karen Stevenson, William Richard, Jr., son-in-law Todd Stevenson, and grandson, Garrett Stevenson. He graduated from Menlo College before going into the Marine Corps. After serving in Korea he returned to study law and received a degree at USF Law School. He was a member of the Trial Lawyers of America, SF Trial Lawyers Association, SF Bar Association, SF Lawyers Club, Marin County Bar Association, and American Arbitration Association. He was admitted to the Supreme Court of the United States in 1965. Bill, an Attorney at law, had a private professional practice in San Francisco. He practiced all over the Bay Area with emphasis on litigation, civil and criminal law. His association with the law lasted over 45 years before he retired. When he first started his practice some clients could not pay their fees, so he would say I'll get it next time. He started getting cakes and chickens weekly like a country lawyer until he told these clients they had paid him in full. He was always ready to help people in trouble, and his advice was free. He always said that joining the Marines was the most important decision he made in his life (besides marrying Peggy). He remained active in the Reserve and served as Commanding Officer of a VTU (law) unit (JAG), at Treasure Island. He retired after 30 total years of service as a Colonel. He holds the Meritorious Service Medal and Combat Action Ribbon. Among their many travels, a great moment was when Bill and Peggy went to Korea on a Revisit Trip to view all the changes since that War. Bill's commitment to serve people did not stop with just being an attorney. As a resident of Tiburon since 1960, he was elected to the City of Tiburon as Councilman in 1966 (now Town of Tiburon). He served as the third Mayor in 1968. He took great satisfaction being able to set goals for a, then, young and growing town. Bill took pleasure owning a powerboat and joined the Corinthian Yacht Club, in Tiburon, becoming Commodore in 1986-87, during its 100-Year Celebration. He had also been a member of the Driftwood Yacht Club in the Delta, and the Richardson Bay Yacht Club. He loved motorcycling with his wife and joined the Montgomery Street Motorcycle Club becoming its President in 1974-75. The neighbors were always shocked by the 30 or more motorcycles in the driveway when Bill would throw a party. Bill and his wife Peggy toured all over the West on his motorcycle with friends and Club members. Being a Life Member of the Marines' Memorial Club of San Francisco was a great joy as he connected with Bay Area Marines. He served on the Board of Directors and became President in 1985-86. The Marine Birthday Ball in November was always a special event he enjoyed because he felt the patriotic warm feeling of being around other Marines. Once a Marine, always a Marine. Continuing with his "can do" attitude, he was a Life member of the San Francisco Council of the Navy League, serving as past President, and Northern California State President. He was named as National Director Emeritus in 2000. Bill became a Life Member of the Naval Order of the United States, serving as the Commandery Commander. He went on to serve as the Commander General (National President) of the Order in 1993-95 traveling all over the United States and was honored to have dedicated the "Great White Fleet Bronze" at The Lone Sailor United States Navy Memorial in Washington, DC on behalf of the Naval Order of the United States. With Bill's association with the Navy, as well as, the Marine's he became Regional Vice President for the Northern California Naval War College in 1997-2000 going to Newport, Rhode Island yearly. He was also on the Board of Directors of Kiwanis in San Francisco 1981-83, and Board of Directors of the Bay Area USO, 1980-89. Also on the Board of Directors of Marshal Hale Memorial Hospital, 1986-88, Children's Hospital, San Francisco, 1988-91 and Bridgeway Plan for Health, 1988-92. After closing his San Francisco Office and practicing at home, Bill then joined the Tiburon-Belvedere Rotary. He served on the Board of Directors and became President, 2001-2002. Bill was an avid piano player and was always a party highlight when he would ask, "if you can sing it, I can play It.". He was energetic, ready with a joke, and had a sharp wit, a wonderful smile, and loved his straight up dry gin martini with no olive. There will be a private service for the family to say good bye. Bill wanted his friends to have a drink in their hands when they remembered him. A party honoring his life will be held at the Marines' Memorial Club in San Francisco on January 30th, 2006 at 4:00 p.m. "Semper Fi" Bill In lieu of flowers, contributions may be made to your favorite charity or in memory of Colonel William R. Bremer, Marines' Memorial Association, 609 Sutter Street, San Francisco, CA 94102.<br>

William BREWSTER
<p>
<a name ="I005931"><b>[I005931]</b></a><br />
William Brewster was born about 1566, the son of William Brewster.  He was educated in both Greek and Latin and spent some time at Cambridge University, although he never completed a full degree.  He went into the service of William Davison, then Secretary of State, while his father back home maintained a position as the postmaster of Scrooby, Nottinghamshire.  Under Davison, Brewster first traveled to the Netherlands.  After Davison's departure as Secretary of State, Brewster worked himself into his father's postmaster duties and maintained Scrooby Manor.  Brewster was instrumental in establishing the small Separatist church with Richard Clyfton, and they often held their meetings in the Manor house.  Brewster and the others were eventually found and forced out, and fleeing prosecution and persecution they headed to Amsterdam in 1608, and moving to Leiden, Holland in 1609.  Brewster became the church's Elder, responsible for seeing that the congregation's members carried themselves properly, both helping and admonishing them when necessary.<br>
<br>
In Leiden, Brewster working with Thomas Brewer became working a printing press and publishing religious books and pamphlets which were then illegally conveyed into England.  Brewster also employed himself teaching University of Leiden students English.  By 1618, the English authorities were onto him and his printing press, and had the Dutch authorities in pursuit of him.  Thomas Brewer was arrested and held in the University of Leiden's prison, but Brewster managed to evade the authorities and went into hiding for a couple years.<br>
<br>
When the Leiden church congregation decided to send the first wave to set up and establish a colony that everyone could eventually move to, their pastor John Robinson decided to remain behind in Leiden with the majority of the congregation, intending to come later.  The smaller group that went on the Mayflower desired the next highest ranking church official, Elder Brewster, go with them; so he agreed.  He brought his wife Mary and two youngest children, Love and Wrestling, on the Mayflower with him.<br>
<br>
Brewster continued his work as Church Elder throughout his life at Plymouth Colony.  His wife Mary died in 1627, and he never remarried.  He lived to be nearly 80 years old, dying in 1644.  Shortly after he died, William Bradford wrote a short but concise biography of Brewster, just a couple pages, in his history Of Plymouth Plantation.<br>

<br>
From Wikipedia<br>
<br>
The Reverend William Brewster (1567 - 1644), was a Pilgrim colonist leader who came from Scrooby, in north Nottinghamshire and reached the American colonies in the Mayflower in 1620, along with his wife, Mary Brewster, and his sons, Love Brewster and Wrestling Brewste<br>
<br>
Origins<br>
Scrooby Manor was in the possession of the Archbishops of York. Brewster's father, William senior, had been the estate bailiff for the archbishop for fifteen years from around 1580. With this post went that of postmaster, which was a more important one than it might have been in another village, which had not been situated on the Great North Road as Scrooby then was.<br>
<br>
William junior studied briefly at Peterhouse College in the University of Cambridge, before entering the service of William Davidson in 1584. In 1585, Davidson went to the Netherlands as an ambassador to the States-General. In 1586 he was appointed assistant to Queen Elizabeth's Secretary of State until Davidson lost the queen's favour in 1587.<br>
<br>
Dissent<br>
Cambridge was a centre of thought concerning religious reformism but Brewster's time in the Netherlands in connection with Davidson's work, gave him opportunity to hear and see more of reformed religion. While, earlier in the sixteenth century, reformers had hoped to amend the Anglican church, by the end of it, many were looking toward splitting from it. (See Brownist).<br>
<br>
On Davidson's disgrace, Brewster returned to Scrooby. There, from 1590 to 1607, he held the position of postmaster. As such he was responsible for the provision of stage horses for the mails. By the 1590s, Brewster's brother, James, was a rather rebellious Anglican priest, vicar of the parish of Sutton and Lound, in Nottinghamshire. From 1594, it fell to James to appoint curates to Scrooby church so that Brewster, James and leading members of the Scrooby congregation were brought before the ecclesiastical court for their dissent. They were set on a path of separation from the Anglican Church. From about 1602, Scrooby Manor, Brewster's home, became a meeting place for the dissenting Puritans. In 1606, they formed the Separatist Church of Scrooby.<br>
<br>
Emigration<br>
Restrictions and pressures applied by the authorities convinced the congregation of a need to emigrate to the more sympathetic atmosphere of Holland but leaving England without permission was illegal at the time so that departure was a complex matter. On its first attempt, the group was arrested at Scotia Creek, in 1607 but Brewster and others left from The Humber in 1608. In 1609, he was selected as ruling elder of the congregation.<br>
<br>
In Leiden, the group managed to make a living. Brewster taught English and later, printed and published religious books for sale in England, though they were proscribed there. In 1619, the printing type was seized by the authorities under pressure from the English ambassador and Brewster's partner was arrested. Brewster escaped and, with the help of Robert Cushman, obtained a land patent from the London Virginia Company on behalf of himself and his colleagues.<br>
<br>
In 1620 he joined the first group of Pilgrims aboard the Mayflower on the voyage to North America. When the colonists landed at Plymouth, Brewster became the senior elder of the colony, serving as its religious leader and as an advisor to Governor William Bradford. Brewster took the part of the colony's religious leader until a pastor, Ralph Smith arrived in 1629. Thereafter he continued to preach until his death in April 1644.<br>
<br>
Descendants<br>
There are many notable descendants of William Brewster including William Howard Taft, Zachary Taylor, Roger Nash Baldwin, and Katharine Hepburn.[Caulkins.FTW]<br>

Thomas Brewer was arrested and held in the University of Leiden's prison, but Brewster managed to evade the authorities and went into hiding for a couple years.<br>
<br>
When the Leiden church congregation decided to send the first wave to set up and establish a colony that everyone could eventually move to, their pastor John Robinson decided to remain behind in Leiden with the majority of the congregation, intending to come later.  The smaller group that went on the Mayflower desired the next highest ranking church official, Elder Brewster, go with them; so he agreed.  He brought his wife Mary and two youngest children, Love and Wrestling, on the Mayflower with him.<br>
<br>
Brewster continued his work as Church Elder throughout his life at Plymouth Colony.  His wife Mary died in 1627, and he never remarried.  He lived to be nearly 80 years old, dying in 1644.  Shortly after he died, William Bradford wrote a short but concise biography of Brewster, just a couple pages, in his history Of Plymouth Plantation.<br>

<br>
The Reverend William Brewster (1567 - 1644), was a Pilgrim colonist leader who came from Scrooby, in north Nottinghamshire and reached the American colonies in the Mayflower in 1620, along with his wife, Mary Brewster, and his sons, Love Brewster and Wrestling Brewste<br>
<br>
Origins<br>
Scrooby Manor was in the possession of the Archbishops of York. Brewster's father, William senior, had been the estate bailiff for the archbishop for fifteen years from around 1580. With this post went that of postmaster, which was a more important one than it might have been in another village, which had not been situated on the Great North Road as Scrooby then was.<br>
<br>
William junior studied briefly at Peterhouse College in the University of Cambridge, before entering the service of William Davidson in 1584. In 1585, Davidson went to the Netherlands as an ambassador to the States-General. In 1586 he was appointed assistant to Queen Elizabeth's Secretary of State until Davidson lost the queen's favour in 1587.<br>
<br>
Dissent<br>
Cambridge was a centre of thought concerning religious reformism but Brewster's time in the Netherlands in connection with Davidson's work, gave him opportunity to hear and see more of reformed religion. While, earlier in the sixteenth century, reformers had hoped to amend the Anglican church, by the end of it, many were looking toward splitting from it. (See Brownist).<br>
<br>
On Davidson's disgrace, Brewster returned to Scrooby. There, from 1590 to 1607, he held the position of postmaster. As such he was responsible for the provision of stage horses for the mails. By the 1590s, Brewster's brother, James, was a rather rebellious Anglican priest, vicar of the parish of Sutton and Lound, in Nottinghamshire. From 1594, it fell to James to appoint curates to Scrooby church so that Brewster, James and leading members of the Scrooby congregation were brought before the ecclesiastical court for their dissent. They were set on a path of separation from the Anglican Church. From about 1602, Scrooby Manor, Brewster's home, became a meeting place for the dissenting Puritans. In 1606, they formed the Separatist Church of Scrooby.<br>
<br>
Emigration<br>
Restrictions and pressures applied by the authorities convinced the congregation of a need to emigrate to the more sympathetic atmosphere of Holland but leaving England without permission was illegal at the time so that departure was a complex matter. On its first attempt, the group was arrested at Scotia Creek, in 1607 but Brewster and others left from The Humber in 1608. In 1609, he was selected as ruling elder of the congregation.<br>
<br>
In Leiden, the group managed to make a living. Brewster taught English and later, printed and published religious books for sale in England, though they were proscribed there. In 1619, the printing type was seized by the authorities under pressure from the English ambassador and Brewster's partner was arrested. Brewster escaped and, with the help of Robert Cushman, obtained a land patent from the London Virginia Company on behalf of himself and his colleagues.<br>
<br>
In 1620 he joined the first group of Pilgrims aboard the Mayflower on the voyage to North America. When the colonists landed at Plymouth, Brewster became the senior elder of the colony, serving as its religious leader and as an advisor to Governor William Bradford. Brewster took the part of the colony's religious leader until a pastor, Ralph Smith arrived in 1629. Thereafter he continued to preach until his death in April 1644.<br>
