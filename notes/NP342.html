George C. MADELEN

<a name ="I047347"><b>[I047347]</b></a><br />
George C. Madelen Jr.: Passion for job, more for family<br>
George C. Madelen Jr. always had a good story to tell.<br>
He could recount the events of the day into a tale, with a little embellishment tossed in to captivate his audience.<br>
Madelen , 88, died Jan. 15 at Hospice House.<br>
His three children remembered a father who balanced his passion for his career in education with his passion for his family.<br>
In 1967, he moved his family to Hutchinson to serve as Hutchinson High School principal and then went on to become assistant superintendent in charge of personnel.<br>
After putting in long hours at school he would make certain to be home at night for supper with his family, before returning for a school activity.<br>
"He had a sense of duty to his job and community. When he was at work he gave a 100 percent, but family was paramount," said his son Mike Madelen .<br>
Along with Mike, Madelen is survived by his daughters Debbe Jantz and Carlye Fast, 10 grandchildren and nine great-grandchildren.<br>
Jantz remembers life with dad as always fun.<br>
"Mom would go to bed early and she thought I needed to go to bed, but I would sneak downstairs to watch movies with dad," said Jantz.<br>
Back in his day, Madelen was a football player in Omaha, Neb. He finished high school early so that he could join the U.S. Marine Corps during World War II. While in the Marines he became the middleweight boxing champion. Then following the service he went to the University of Colorado where he played football.<br>
It was at CU that he met the love of his life, Myrna Storm, who was also from Omaha. They went skiing on their first date. Their marriage was filled with many moves as he rose in his career. He began as a teacher and football coach, then as a principal at Goodland High School, and then on to Abilene High School before coming to Hutchinson. While in Abilene during the 1960s, a tornado destroyed the school's gymnasium and he was involved with the plans for rebuilding.<br>
For relaxation he enjoyed golf and tennis and enjoyed playing mixed doubles tennis with Myrna.<br>
Because he was a member of the Kansas State High School Activities Association who went to national conventions, the family would turn those meetings into summer vacations.<br>
"He taught me a lot about honesty," said Jantz. "When I was going to marry he told me that I had chosen this man to be my husband, and he didn't expect me to come running home saying I couldn't handle it."<br>
Her parent's rock-solid marriage was an inspiration for her.<br>
Myrna died April 3, 1991, and he never remarried.<br>
Carlye Fast was his youngest child who traveled to sporting events with him.<br>
"My hair was cut short and he called me Sam," said Fast.<br>
She remembers playing tennis from the time she was 6 and going on to the national level. He was nervous watching her play.<br>
"I'd look and he'd be standing behind a tree," Fast said.<br>
She saw him as a big teddy bear who came across gruff and stern and very structured. But, that's a side his grandchildren never knew. To them he just had a huge heart.<br>
"He adored all his grandchildren," Fast said.<br>
His great-grandchildren are worried who will watch cartoons with them and read them stories.<br>
He was always asking how the kids were doing; he always had a lesson and story.<br>
The family will miss him terribly, Mike Madelen said, and his ability to make them all laugh.<br>

Rhun ap MAELGWN
<p>
<a name ="I008714"><b>[I008714]</b></a><br />
From Wikipedia<br>
<br>
Rhun ap Maelgwn (c.492-c.586, reigned from c.549) (Latin: Rugenus, English: Run), also known as Rhun Hir ('the Tall') was a king of Gwynedd.<br>
<br>
Ascending to the throne of what was then the most powerful kingdom of Britain in his twenties upon the death of his father, Maelgwn Hir ap Cadwallon, from plague, Rhun soon found himself embroiled in a dynastic dispute with Elidyr Llydanwyn, king of Rheged. Elidyr had married Rhun's sister, and as a result believed himself to be the proper heir to the throne of Gwynedd. Elidyr's attempted invasion of Gwynedd, proved unsuccessful, and Elidyr himself was killed in the attempt. Elidyr's cousins, however, Rhydderch Hen of Strathclyde, and Clydno Eiten of Lothian, remained bitter rivals of Rhun, and of his half-brother, Brude, leader of the Picts to the south. Rhydderch and Clydno, aided by Elidyr's brother Cinmarc, raided and sacked the town of Arfon (now Caernarfon) in Anglesey.<br>
<br>
Raising an army from all over northern Wales, Rhun retaliated, marching unopposed through Rheged and across the Pennines to York, effectively seizing control of all of north Wales and northern England and, through alliance with Brude, even stretching south in the lands held by the Picts. Though his authority was recognized by all, Rhun lacked the resources to maintain administrative control over such a large area, and eventually made peace with Peredur of York and returned to Gwynedd, probably towards the mid-560s. Rhun reigned for another two decades, but little else is heard of him.<br>
