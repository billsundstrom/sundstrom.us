<h2>Notes</h2>
Arnulf I of BAVARIA
<p>
<a name ="I007790"><b>[I007790]</b></a><br />
Arnulf I, called der Böse ("the Bad" or "the Evil") (died July 14, 937), was duke of Bavaria from 907 until his death. He was a member of the Luitpolding dynasty.<br>
<br>
Arnulf was the son of Margrave Luitpold of Bavaria and Kunigunde, daughter of Berchthold I, count of Swabia. Besieged by frequent raids by the Hungarians and desperate to raise funds to finance a defence, Arnulf strengthened his power through confiscation of church lands and property, which earned him the nickname "the Bad". He re-established the duchy of Bavaria and eventually negotiated a truce with the Hungarians who thereafter largely passed though Bavaria on their raids into other German territories. Arnold vigorously resisted Emperor Conrad, Duke of Franconia (and the second husband of Arnulf's mother Kunigunde), but later submitted to Conrad's successor as King of the Germans, Henry the Fowler of Saxony, who confirmed Arnulf's sovereignty over Bavaria.<br>
<br>
Arnulf was married to Judith of Friaul, daughter of Count Eberhard of Sülichgau and Gisela of Verona. Arnulf's daughter Judith married Henry I of Bavaria, brother of Otto I, Holy Roman Emperor.<br>
<br>
Arnulf died in Regensburg in 937 and was buried in St. Emmeram.<br>
</p>
Garibald I of BAVARIA
<p>
<a name ="I010763"><b>[I010763]</b></a><br />
The first duke of Bavaria we know of, and likely the first, was Gariwald, or Garibald, I, a member of the powerful Agilolfing family.6   This was the beginning of a series of Agilolfing dukes that was to last until 788.<br>
<br>
His Family<br>
The Agilofings were a family of Frankish or Bavarian nobility that ruled the historical teritory of Bavaria on behalf of their Frankish overlords from about 550 until 788. The first duke of their line mentioned in any documents, and probably the first, was Gariwald, or Garibald I.He surrendered his country to his great-uncle Clotaire I.<br>
</p>
Welf I of BAVARIA
<p>
<a name ="I004864"><b>[I004864]</b></a><br />

The Beach family are of French and English ancestry. Lydia Wright was a daughter of John, who was of Welsh and English descent. To Abner Beach, were born three children-Luman, Marsh and Maria. Luman and wife, were married in Connecticut, moved to Cattaraugus Co., N. Y., remained one year, and in 1804 moved to Ashtabula Co., Ohio, and located on land given him by John Wright, his father-in-law. During this time, war broke out, and Mr. Beach cast his lot among the number who were to defend themselves against the British and Indians. Returning home after the war, he lived there until 1834, when he moved to Wadsworth Township, where he lived until removed by death, which occurred Dec. 28, 1836. His wife died Jan. 25, 1849. She was a Presbyterian ; he was not a member of any church, but made a profession of religion some time ere his death. Jonathan being young at the time of his father's death, he lived with his mother, and assisted her in the management of the farm. Oct. 31, was married to Mrs. Angeline Brooks, who was born in Connecticut, daughter of Shubael Whitney. She died in 1858, leaving him one child-Luman, now in Washington Territory ; was a soldier in the late war, a young man of energy, and has been in that region for several years. Oct. 30, 1859, Mr. Beach married his present wife, who was Caroline K. Clapp, eldest child born to Luther Clapp, of this township. She was born May 23, 1839, in this township, where her parents first settled. Mr. Beach was one of the " boys in blue," entering the first year of the war, Sept. 24, 1861, in Co. B, 42d 0. V. L, and served three years, and received an honorable discharge, Dec. 29, 1864, having been a faithful and efficient soldier. The last two years, he was permanently connected with the hospital as a nurse, and assistant to the Medical Corps. He had no superiors. For a few years after Mr. Beach was first married, he carried on the blacksmith's trade. After he came to this township, he was engaged in selling medicine some time, and finally settled down to farming, in which vocation he has since been engaged.

  In 1904 Mr. Beadle was connected with the California Gas & Electric Co. Since that time he has been identified with business enterprises in Honolulu, being one of the incorporators of the Trent Trust Co., Ltd., in 1905. He has been secretary of the firm since its incorporation.<br>
  Mr. Beadle was born in Oswego, N.Y., the son of G. N. and Melissa (Hubbard) Beadle. He is a descendant of G. N. Beadle, who settled in Connecticut before the American Revolution.

TEACHING IN HONOLULU <br>
George N. Beadle, of Scriba, has received an interesting letter from his son, Irwin H. Beadle, teacher in the Kamehameha school at Honolulu, HI. Mr. Beadle graduated from the Oswego Normal school in the class of '97 and went to~ his present position in August last. He speaks well of the school and enjoys the work, but says that they are having a sad time there at present because of a large number of the boys being sick with the measles. Two of the boys died. In speaking of the funeral of one of them the writer says: <br>
"The flag I was at half-mast on the campus and the service was held in our little chapel which, by the way, is as fine a building as there is in Oswego in the shape of a church. The boys all marched down to the steamer, where the body was carried to be shipped home to his parents. The boys were all dressed in their gray uniforms and carried the flag. They presented a fine appearance and I wish those old farmers who talk about cannibals could hare seen them. Everything, in some respects, is as modern as in the States. There are more rubber tired wagons here than in any city I have been in excepting New York. <br>
"I want to tell you about poi and poi making. It is made from the root of the taro plant which grows in the irrigated fields. Taro looks something like turnip. The thick, flashy roots. are cleaned and ground and then made into a thick paste. This has a pleasant, sour taste, which one likes when accustomed to it. I have learned to like it. It is a distinctly native dish and f sis fish or salt pig is usually eaten with it. To eat it, you stick your fork into it and with a quick, deft twist put it into your mouth. <br>
"The poi looks like thick, gray gravy. The natives in the olden times dispensed with forks and simply used the finger, and thumb. When the poi is thin, they use three fingers. Then they call It three finger poi, the other two finger poi. They would sit around a big calabash filled with poi and all eat from the same dish. This habit is supposed to have been one of the means of spreading the leprosy. Poi is very healthy and that is the reason the natives are so fat. <br>
"Some people have an idea that there are lepers on the inland, which is not true. There are no lepers on any of the islands except Molokai. "Here everyone rides horseback, although it is not necessary, for we have better roads than you find any where in the northern part of New York State. One sees as great a proportion of bicycles here as on Long Island. <br>
"Honolulu has a population of nearly 50,000. It is a very beautiful place and lies at the foot of two lofty volcanoes, which are now extinct, called Diamond Head and Punch. Bowl. <br>
"The chief crops here are taro and rice, which is raised in the low lands, and bananas and pineapples, which grow on the higher lands. Along the beach are thousands of coconut trees. Oranges, dates, guava, tamarind, mangoes, grapes, bread fruit and every other sort of tropical fruit is seen in abundance, <br>
"There is no weather here that even approaches to winter, but there is a wet and dry season. Some days it rains three or four times and some it doesn't rain at all. <br>
"Since I have been herd the thermometer has not registered below 69°, nor above 76°, most of the time it does vary two degrees from 76°." <br>
In speaking of his assent of a mountain with a friend Mr. Beadle says: <br>
"We went on horseback and when we arrived at the highest point to which we could urge the animals we picketed them and began the remainder of the ascent on foot. After climbing for an hour we reached a point where the rocks began to ascend almost vertically. By hard climbing we at last reached the highest point. It was a very sharp, ragged peak; the top of it was not over two rods in diameter. On the windward side it descended in sheer precipice of several thousand feet and on the leeward tile, toward Honolulu, it sloped away at a very sharp angle. This precipice is called Kalihi Pai. Several miles away we could see Honolulu, and away in the other direction we saw the mountains, while the sea could be seen beyond. On the way back ire stopped at the hut of an old Chinaman, and he gave us a big bowl of Poi, and at another Chinese farmer's we got a papaito to eat. If you could see the Chinamen hero you would have more respect for them than yon do now."<br>
Mr. Beadle closes with messages to his relatives and another expression of his liking for the school and its work. <br>

Dr. Beaman was cornetist with the Theodore Thomas Orchestra in Cincinnati and later cornet soloist at old St. Thomas Church in New York City. But that is another story.<br>
Changed to Voice Study<br>
Along with a groundwork in music laid for Louise through her activities in the glee clubs of St. Margaret's. Waterbury, and the National Park Seminary, she had undertaken the study of piano. However, when Dr. Hollis E. Dann urged that she change to voice culture, his advice was followed.<br>
This led to voice instruction in Ithaca Conservatory, now the Ithaca College of Music, and Miss Beaman joined Dr. Dann's church choir, the Cornell Choir and the Festival Chorus.<br>
At the Institute of Musical Art, New York City, Miss Beaman was advised by no less an authority than Dr. Damrosch that she should make her voice her professional career. Then began long and tireless study under Eric Dudley, Milka Ternina, Louise von Feillch, John Walter Hall, Vilonat, Bristol, Brady, Samoiloff, Ernst Knoch and five years of association with Emil Polak as student and assistant teacher.<br>
Some of the church in which she appeared as Miss Beaman and - after 1907 - as Mrs. Carl W. Haefner were St. Marks-on-the-Bouwerie, New York City; St. Paul's, Brooklyn; Keap Street Synagogue, Brooklyn; Summer Synagogue, Long Branch, N.J.; Madison Avenue Presbyterian, New York City; Old Reformed Church, Jamaica, L.I. and than the First Presbyterian in Albany and the First Baptist in Troy.<br>
Incidentally, too, Mrs. Beaman sang with the Century and Aborn Opera Companies among others and headed her own company for three years, touring from Chicago under Redpath's sponsorship.<br>
Appeared in Recitals<br>
She has appeared in recitals at the Lake Placid Club, at the Chautauqua, Chicago University, the Berkley Hotel, California, the Woman's Club of Jamaica and in Albany to mention but a few. For nine years she was chairman of music in the Albany Woman's Club and has been teaching for 20 years. The Haefner Studio of Voice was launched about a dozen years ago.<br>
Many of Mrs. Haefner-Ives students are to be found in Capital District church choirs and not a few have achieved prominence on the radio, including Katharine Kent, Mircile Eamond, Alan Stuart, Paul Curtis and Floyd Haber.<br>
At present, Mrs. Haefner-Ives is deeply concerned in rehearsals for a presentation of "The Tales of Hoffman" with her own company of student-stingers. It is to be the first of a series of operatic ventures in which those participating co-operate not alone in vocal in costuming end scenic preparation.<br>

Dr. Charles P. Beaman, of Ithaca, died at his home shortly after 7 p. m. yesterday, after an illness that had been weakening him during the last four months.<br>
Dr. Beaman came to Ithaca in 1892, from a general practice in Chattanooga, Tens., and took offices at the corner of State street and Cayuga. From the beginning he was popular with the Cornell undergraduate body, and was named physician to the Cornell Athletic Association several years ago. This position he held until his death.<br>
Last May Dr. Beaman's health broke down. He spent the summer at Vineland, N. J., in the hope of recovering his former vigor; but on his return to Ithaca about a month ago, sank gradually lower and loww until the end came last night.<br>
Dr. Beaman is survived by a wife, two daughters and a son, C. Leicester Beaman, '08. His Ithaca practice will be carried on by Dr. Henry B. Herriam,<br>
'91, of Owego, with whom he recently went into partnership.<br>
