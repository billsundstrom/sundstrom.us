Kathleen J. "Kay" Bratta , 59, entered into peaceful rest Thursday, Sept. 22, 2005, in her home after a long, courageous battle with cancer. She was born Dec. 22, 1945, in Stillman Valley, the daughter of Donald and Maida Hildebrand Grennan. She attended Stillman Valley schools and lived her entire lifetime in the Stillman Valley area. She married Phillip J. Bratta on June 21, 1969, in Byron. Kay loved being a teacher and loved children. She taught, primarily, elementary students for 25 years, the past 23 at Highland and Monroe Center Elementary schools. She retired from teaching in 2003. Kay was a great teacher, molded many young children and started them on their path to reading. Students of all ages continued to receive a hug from Kay whenever and wherever they met. She enjoyed cooking, gardening and sewing, and was an avid reader and musician. She was a member of St. Mary Catholic Church in Byron, where she played the organ for 25 years. Kay enjoyed an open table with family and friends, and the table was always full of food. She didn't just live life; she celebrated and was thankful for every day she spent on this Earth with family and friends. She's now at peace and no longer suffering. She always had a smile on her face, and it was contagious. She will be deeply missed by all who knew her.

Dr. Frank Loxley Griffin, 88, former president and professor of mathematics at Reed College who was considered by many as the most influential teacher of mathematics in the United States, died Sunday, Nov. 9, at a local hospital.<br>
<br>
He had been hospitalized since Sept 19. His death ended a career that spanned the entire history of Reed College, and produced a major influence on the teaching of mathematics.<br>
<br>
Dr. Griffin was the first faculty member selected to teach at Reed. William Trufant Foster, first president Reed, hired him away from Williams College, Williamstown, Mass. Dr. Griffin welcomed the freedom of Reed offered to experiment with new ideas in teaching.<br>
<br>
He taught at Reed for 41 years, from 1911 to 1952. He emerged from retirement in 194 to become college president and steer Reed through a period of perplexing controversy growing from the appearance of a number of Reed faculty members and students before the House of Representatives' Un-American Activities Committee.<br>
<br>
Following his firs and second retirements, he was a visiting professor at several American colleges and universities.<br>
<br>
In 1921 his firs book, "Introduction to Mathematical Analysis: was acclaimed by "Scientific American" magazine, which said, "if we had our way, every teacher of mathematics would be obliged to read this book, and every person with responsibility for laying out of mathematical instruction in any of our colleges would be obliged to read a chapter from it every morning before breakfast." This textbook became the first American one adopted by a European university. He wrote six others, and many articles on mathematics and education.<br>
<br>
He was an advocate of teaching excellence and was a self-announced enemy of sloth and "Dr. Dull and Dreary." Dr. Griffin specialized in helping students, who had little aptitude for or interest in learning mathematics. He was acclaimed for making it so interesting that they ended up begging for homework.<br>
<br>
In 1938 he was honored by the General Education Board of the Rockefeller Foundation, which sent four young mathematicians to work under him and learn his teaching principles.<br>
Born in Topeka, Kan., in 1881, he attended the University of Chicago, and received bachelor's, master's and doctor's degrees magna cum laude. He was awarded special honors for work in mathematics and astronomy. He received special citations for public service and education from the University of Oregon, the Oregon Academy of Science and the University of Chicago Alumni Association.<br>
Dr. Griffin was first vice president and member of the board of governors of the Mathematical Association of America, and the Association of University Professors.<br>
He was president of the Oregon Academy of Science, a governor of the City Club of Portland, a regent of Multnomah College for 25 years, a fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, a trustee of the Oregon Society of the Sons of the American Revolution, and a member of the Highland Baptist Church.<br>
His wife, Mary Chambers Griffin, died Sept. 30, 1964. Dr. Griffin is survived by children: Mrs. Clark Tibbitts, Rockville, Md., Mrs. Howard Stephenson, Portland, Mrs. C. Marshall Gray, Lake Oswego, and Frank L. Griffin Jr., Western Springs, Ill., 12 grandchildren and 15 great grandchildren.<br>
Interment will be private. A memorial service will be held at Reed College in late November.<br>

Geraldine Gladys GRIFFIN
<p>
<a name ="I105259"><b>[I105259]</b></a><br />
Geraldine "Gerry" Gladys Koch was born Aug. 11, 1937, to Pauline and Jackson Griffin in Twin Falls, Idaho. She fell asleep peacefully in the arms of her Lord on Friday, April 30, 2010, in a Meridian hospital with family by her side.<br>
Gerry was raised and attended school in Twin Falls until her marriage to Wayne Russell Koch on Nov. 9, 1953, in California, which later ended in divorce. Five children were born to this union, Raymond Koch of Colorado, Duane Koch of California, Debra Koch of Twin Falls, Dianna Stritesky of Twin Falls and Merlin (Barbara) Koch of Hagerman.<br>
After leaving California and trying to make a life for herself and her children briefly in Tennessee, she returned to Idaho and attended the Twin Falls Business College. She obtained her degree in May of 1969, something she was extremely proud of and one of her many accomplishments in life. She enjoyed cooking, baking and gardening and, even when health issues made it difficult for her to do independently, she made sure to supervise with a watchful eye. Somehow, someway she had her hand in everything and wouldn't have it any other way. She enjoyed hours on end reading, doing puzzles and playing cards with family laughing hysterically until she'd hurt. She cared for and taught great-grandchildren with love and tenderness, making sure they never went without.<br>
Gerry cherished her special friendship with Sharon Malcomson and Leroy Olsen for many years and, thanks to the Internet, she was fortunate enough to reunite with her dear friend, Maxine Fontes in California. She and Maxine spent the last 10 years swapping coins through the mail for their collections. Gerry's heart was enormous and not only did she have room for her very large family but also the many handicapped clients she cared for through her many years working for the state at ACDC (Adult and Child Development Center.) She loved them unconditionally regardless of their flaws and they loved her unconditionally in return. If you knew Gerry, you also knew her love for animals. There was not a stray she wouldn't feed, a wound uncared for or a sickness she couldn't nurse. She was a true angel on earth who loved regardless of fault and forgave regardless of wrongdoing.<br>
Aside from her children, she is survived by her sisters, Charlotte (Wayne) Short, Bonnie (Ed) DeVall and Mary (Don) Patterson, all of Twin Falls; her grandchildren, Stephanie, Theresa, Kimberly, Jason, Lisa, Domaulis, Greg, Gary, James, Sam, Josh, Mathew, Michael, Jacob and Andrew; 32 great-grandchildren; as well as numerous nieces, nephews, extended family members and friends, all of whom share the emptiness of her passing. She was preceded in death by her mother, Pauline Griffin; sister, Patricia Volk; and grandson, Charles Koch .<br>
A celebration of Gerry's life will be held at 11 a.m. Saturday, May 8, at White Mortuary, 136 Fourth Ave. E. in Twin Falls, with Pastor Dale Metzger officiating. No public viewing will take place. A reception will follow at the home of Wayne and Charlotte Short, 4067 N. 3300 E. in Twin Falls.<br>
