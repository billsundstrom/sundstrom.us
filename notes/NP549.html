Vernice Grace Adeline TRIBE
<p>
<a name ="I065321"><b>[I065321]</b></a><br />
Vernice Grace Adeline Soderquist, known to all as "Verne", was born on December 17th, 1925 to William and Eva Tribe in the small farming community of Leslieville, Alberta. Verne grew up near the community of Whitelaw, Alberta, where she, her parents and her brother, Bud owned a homestead. As a young child, Verne developed an independent spirit, and an enduring love of animals (especially horses) and of the scenery of the Peace River country.<br>
When Verne was about 24 years old, she began work at the Hudson Bay Company based out of Peace River, Alberta, and later in the early telephone offices as a switchboard operator. One summer night, she was headed to work on the bus and a terrible forest fire had broken out. The road became engulfed in smoke, and it was very difficult for the bus driver to see. As the only passenger on the bus, Verne sat in the front with the driver to help him navigate through the smoke. That bus driver was Oscar Soderquist, whom she married on June 24th, 1950. The way they met depicted exactly how they were as a couple; a team.<br>
Verne and Oscar settled in Grande Prairie, Alberta, where they welcomed their children Merv, Heather and Randy. In 1961, Verne and Oscar moved to Dawson Creek, BC where they purchased a hobby farm. Verne actively supported her children in 4-H and gymkhana and always had a wonderful garden. Eventually, Verne and Oscar became agent/operators of the Dawson Creek Greyhound Bus depot. They worked side by side running a successful business until their retirement from Greyhound in 1978.<br>
For many years, Verne was a member of the South Peace Art Society and, in 1984, was given the great honour of being named ʻArtist of the Yearʼ. In 1997, Verne hosted her own art show called ʻGenerationsʼ. Art was a way in which Verne could express herself, and luckily for all of us, has left us with a beautiful legacy of what was dear to her heart.<br>
Verne passed away on Wednesday, November 13, 2013 in Fort St. John at the age of 87 years. A memorial service, officiated by Pauline Haycock, was held on Friday, November 22, 2013 at 1:00 pm at Reynars Funeral Chapel. Special memories of Verne were presented by her granddaughter, Lana Soderquist. Interment followed in the Brookside Cemetery.<br>
Verne is survived by her children: Merv (Donna), Heather (Wayne), and Randy (Denise); by her grandchildren: Angela, Paul (Olesya), Stephanie (Brett), Lana (Chris), Ryan, Kelsey, and Morgan and by her great grandchildren: Abby and Bennett. Verne was predeceased by her husband, Oscar, and her granddaughter, Danielle. <br>
Verneʼs family would like to thank her friends and the staff of the Peace Villa Care Home for their care and support. For friends so wishing, donations may be made in memory of Verne to the Peace Villa Care Home, 8407 - 112 Avenue, Fort St. John, BC V1J 0J5.<br>

Chilion Alexander TRIMBLE
<p>
<a name ="I012624"><b>[I012624]</b></a><br />
TRIMBLE, Chillion N. (Col.)<br>
Died at his residence in Crownpoint, on the 6th instant, Col. CHILLION N. TRIMBLE, aged 64 years.<br>
Col. Trimble was a highly respectable citizen, a large and wealthy farmer, and had held many offices of responsibility and trust, among which was that of Sheriff of the County. He leaves a widow and sons and daughters, and a large circle of friends and relatives who sincerely mourn his loss.<br>
The Elizabethtown Post 13 March 1862<br>
---------------------------------------------------------------<br>
Chilion A. Trimble was a descendant of one of the pioneer families of Crown Point. He was born either in 1797 or 1798, according to the evidence given in the 1850 census. The date of his death is unknown.<br>
<br>
 He served as Town Supervisor for Crown Point in 1831, 1833, 1834, and 1838, and was Essex County Sheriff between 1843 and 1846.<br>
<br>
 According to the 1850 census, his true occupation was that of a farmer (correspondence indicates that he had speculated in land). The same census showed that he was married and had seven children between the ages of one and eleven.<br>
<br>
 Most of the correspondence, especially in the later years, concerned land transactions. The law firm of Swetland and Beckwith (also Beckwith and Immin, and Beckwith and Johnson) of Plattsburgh, and Samuel Keese, of Keeseville, were major land correspondents.<br>
<br>
 The most interesting letters in the collection, however, are those dealing with the local and state politics from the mid-1830's to the mid1860's. One correspondent of particular interest was Anson H. Allen, editor of the Keeseville Herald. When he moved to Westport in 1862 he became editor of the Essex County Times and the Westport Herald. The other is Oliver Keese, a member of the prominent Keese family. These letters give fairly detailed accounts of political action in Essex County at the time.<br>
<br>
 The letters were donated to the Clinton County Historical Association by Mrs. Watson and Mrs. LaDue, and are on deposit in Special Collections.<br>
---------------------------------------------------------------<br>
Chilion Alexander Trimble was a descendant of one of the pioneer families of Crown Point. He was born September 13, 1798 at Crown Point, New York, died in March 1862, and is buried in the First Congregational ("Brick Church") Cemetery on the green in Crown Point village. He was the son of Alexander Trimble and Agnes Burwell and married Charlotte F. Stone on September 4, 1838. (Furness) <br>
 According to the 1850 census, his true occupation was that of a farmer (correspondence indicates that he had speculated in land). The same census showed that he had seven children between the ages of one and eleven. See also the Agricultural Section of the 1855 New York State Census (Furness). Trimble served as Town Supervisor for Crown Point in 1831, 1833, 1834, and 1838, and was Essex County Sheriff between 1843 and 1846. <br>

Annette Trinity-Stevens died Sunday evening, March 4, 2007. She was 46 years old. A long-time MSU employee, Annette recently held the position of news director at MSU.<br>
In the fall of 2006, Annette was diagnosed with a rare cancer. Unlike many metastatic cancers, her disease had an "unknown primary" origin. In addition to working with Dr. Annie Castillo in Bozeman, she consulted specialists at the Mayo Clinic and the Fred Hutchinson Center in Seattle.<br>
Always of good cheer, she fought the disease valiantly. Annette made it through December and January and was hoping for an early spring trip to Utah to take in the wildflowers and the desert sun.<br>
However, her health declined dramatically in early February. After almost two weeks in the hospital, Annette was taken home. She dropped into a deep sleep on a Sunday morning and never woke up. Her family was present when she died.<br>
A native Montanan, Annette Kathleen Trinity was born April 30, 1960, in Helena. She was one of five girls born to John and Noel Trinity. Annette attended grade school in Missoula and graduated from Sentinel High School in Missoula in 1978. Always an excellent student, Annette enjoyed poetry, great writing and playing the violin.<br>
As a child, she attended Lindisfarne/Camp Marshall, an Episcopal Church camp on Flathead Lake. It was a magical place for her. While working there in the summer of 1978 she met David Stevens. Eventually David and Annette would marry and have two children: Derek Richard, born in 1991, and Emily Aidan, born in 1996.<br>
Annette started her college career as a drama major at the University of Montana. She eventually switched to English and began working part time U of Mʼs news and publication department. That experience gave her a professional direction that she would follow until her death.<br>
Graduating with a bachelorʼs of arts degree in 1984, she moved to Bozeman to join David. Like many newcomers she tackled a variety of jobs. However, Annette never drifted too far from good books and great writing. She worked at Poor Richardʼs Bookstore and was a free-lance writer and editor.<br>
Her experience and perseverance eventually landed her a job writing for the MSU Research Department. One of the many assignments she enjoyed was taking extensive road trips of Montana and talking with the editors and publishers of many of the smaller newspapers.<br>
<br>
In 2003 Annette became the News Director for MSU. She liked her job and had immense respect for her fellow staff members and colleagues. In turn, she was a beloved supervisor and manager admired by fellow employees as well as journalists throughout the state who respected her professionalism and judgment.<br>
Like many young women, Annette felt her greatest accomplishment in life was being a mother. She always managed to carve out time for her children and maintain that delicate balance between a home life and a professional career.<br>
Annette enjoyed reading, listening to music, having coffee with friends and playing the violin. She liked the outdoors, often starting the day walking around the Bozeman ponds. She exercised regularly, even after being diagnosed with cancer.<br>
Some of Annetteʼs best times were spent with her family skiing and ice skating. Her last family outing was a seven-mile hike to Lava Lake on Labor Day weekend.<br>
She was preceded in death by her beloved great-aunt Jessie Taylor.<br>
Annette is survived by her immediate family: husband, David, and children, Derek and Emily. She is also survived by her mother and stepfather, Noel and Peter Walther of Polson, and her father and stepmother, John and Martha Trinity of Havre.<br>

Annette enjoyed visiting with her many nephews, nieces. in-laws and cousins. By marriage she is related to the following local people: Ardis A. Stevens of Bozeman; David Ray and Nike Stevens of Clyde Park; Steven and Debbie Shope of Bozeman.<br>
Having married into a family descended from pioneers, she is connected to the following family names that have been in the West since the 1850s and Montana since the 1870s: Shope, Hyatt, Stevens, Wright, Rutledge and Stinson.<br>
Annette was a true friend, a gifted writer, a first-rate mom, a steady and trusting sister and a loving and faithful wife. She possessed a keen intellect, playful demeanor and a great sense of humor. She will truly be missed.<br>

John took credit for all eleven grandchildren, after composing and singing a song to his four, then married, but childless children, entitled "Wouldn't it be Grand to have a Grandchild?" <br>
John was born in Orange, NJ, to Harrison and Ragna Trowbridge , who accompanied John and Betty to San Diego (where Ragna lived to be 101, celebrating her 100th birthday on the Bahia Belle in Mission Bay). <br>
John graduated from UCLA with a degree in engineering. He then married Betty, his elementary school sweetheart and next door neighbor from Oklahoma City, OK. After a stint in the Army, he worked as an engineer for several years, moving the family to Denver, CO. While in Colorado, John bought into Regional Sales Company, becoming a manufacturer's representative and traveling the Western U.S. to sell mining and hardware equipment and products. He had two wonderful partners in such business, Al Roth, who predeceased him, and Fred Fankell, who still resides in Colorado. After raising his children in Colorado and sending them off to college and graduate school, John took his wife and moved to Mission Bay. He spent many happy years with Betty in a condo over- looking the Bay, creating an ideal vacation spot for visiting children and grandchildren. Grandpa (or "Poppy" to some of his grandchildren) could be counted on for a golf outing, a trip to Sea World, and lots of ocean time. John surfed into his 70s at Mission Beach. John loved to learn new things and to improve existing skills. He was a longtime member of Toastmasters and took singing lessons. One of his family's most enduring memories is John singing O Holy Night as a solo in church on Christmas Eve. John believed in knowing everyone's name and in a firm handshake. After retirement, John took guitar and Spanish lessons. He and Betty were avid golfers, frequenting most of San Diego's golf courses. John was active in churches in Colorado and San Diego, serving in leadership roles and singing with the choirs. He and Betty volunteered weekly at the Presbyterian Crisis Center (now PUM) in San Diego and cooked and served many meals at Point Loma Presbyterian Church's Ocean Beach Soup Kitchen. John was an Eagle Scout, as were all three of his sons and two of his grandsons. John loved to jog and never passed a dog that did not want to follow him home. He battled Parkinson's disease valiantly, undergoing Deep Brain Stimulation ("DBS") surgery, joining Parkinson's support groups, and singing with the "Tremble Cleffs." John , Dad, Grandpa, and Poppy, thanks for giving yourself to us. We miss you!<br>
