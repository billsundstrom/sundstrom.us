Juggling to thrive: Karen Gilles Larson takes charge<br>
by Judy Woodward<br>
When Karen Gilles Larson (economics '75) started taking classes at the U in 1966, she was a 24-year-old mother with three children under five. It took her nine years to get her degree and another decade before she launched her real career.<br>
As a professional woman, Larson may have been something of a late bloomer, but she certainly has made up for it since. Larson is now the president and CEO of Synovis Life Technologies, a medical device manufacturer that recently celebrated 25 straight profitable quarters and earned itself a slot on the Fortune 100 Fastest Growing Companies and Forbes 200 Best Small Companies lists, and the Russell 2000® Index.<br>
Larson is widely credited for turning around the Minneapolis-based company after a change in Medicare reimbursement policies caused a devastating plunge in demand for the company's main product, the Peri-Strip implantable surgical aid. Under Larson's leadership, the company diversified its product line, developed new markets for the Peri-Strip, and bounced back more profitable than before.<br>
It's a record that any executive would be proud of, and in Larson's case it's all the more remarkable because when she started in the industry she was usually one of the only women in whatever business situation she found herself in.<br>
When she reflects on the far-from-unbroken arc of her career, Larson says, "I am evidence that there is no 'mommy track.' I say to young women, ʻDon't accept the stereotypes. Define your own path.'<br>
Larson began her own path in life most inauspiciously, as the daughter of an absent father and an alcoholic mother. She remembers a lonely Christmas Eve from her early childhood when her mother lay in a stupor on the couch while the holiday cooking smells from the kitchen gradually turned acrid. "The child I was died in that moment," she says, "but survival mechanisms carried me through.<br>
Maybe it was her instinct for survival that propelled her to continue her education. After leaving home at the age of 16, she was able to finish high school with the help of a part-time job and a friend's parents, who gave her a place to live. She started college in La Crosse, Wisc., but soon left to marry and start a family.<br>
Several years later, she was living in Minneapolis when she decided to pursue an interest in investing by taking a few classes at the University. She laughs, "It gave me adults to talk to, because otherwise I was at home with three small children."<br>
From mommy track to fast track<br>
While raising a family-her last child was born in 1972-Larson continued to take classes whenever she could fit them in. In 1975, she graduated with a minor in chemistry in addition to her B.A. in economics. And then, she jokes, "I did what anybody with a chemistry background would do. [With friends] I opened Mes Amies clothing shop on the site of what is now Java Jack's in south Minneapolis.<br>
It wasn't until 1983 that Larson, newly divorced and with her children's college tuition bills looming, decided to enter the corporate world. In a nine-month whirl, she armed herself with an additional degree in accounting from the University of Saint Thomas and then acquired her first "business" job, as an accountant. In April of 1989, she joined what was then called Bio-Vascular, Inc. Less than a decade later, in 1997, she became the head of the company, renamed Synovis Life Technologies.<br>
Although Larson has been praised for her collegial management style, she dismisses the notion that women manage differently. "It's truly an individual thing," she says. She refers to herself as "an equalist" when it comes to personnel decisions. "My only question is ʻCan you do the job?' I respect anyone who respects others.<br>
At the summit of her career, Larson has recently set some new goals for herself. She intends to step down as CEO in two years, when she will be 63. Unlike some retired executives, Larson has no intention of taking things easy. She plans to write two books. One will be on leadership. "The other will be on how to survive a dysfunctional family upbringing," she says. "It's a giftwhy one person is a survivor, but there are things you can do when you are on that journey that can change the path.<br>
With Larson, whether it's juggling family and career, running a company, or writing a book, her response is always the same. "I've always looked around-usually up-and said to myself, I think I can do that.'"<br>

<a name ="I005596"><b>[I005596]</b></a><br />
Offa (or Alavivaz Olauus) (? - c. 456) was the 4th-great-grandfather of Creoda of Mercia; he may also be a great-grandson of Odin. He was also a 46th-great-grandfather of British Prime Minister Winston Churchill and a 42nd-great grandfather of Louis XVII of France. Offa's son was Angeltheow.<br>
<br>
He was the most famous hero of the early Angli. He is said by the Anglo-Saxon poem Widsith to have ruled over Angel, and the poem refers briefly to his victorious single combat, a story which is related at length by the Danish historians Saxo and Svend Aagesen. Offa (Uffo) is said to have been dumb or silent during his early years, and to have only recovered his speech when his aged father Wermund was threatened by the Saxons, who insolently demanded the cession of his kingdom. Offa undertook to fight against both the Saxon king's son and a chosen champion at once. The combat took place at Rendsburg on an island in the Eider, and Offa succeeded in killing both his opponents. According to Widsith Offa's opponents belonged to a tribe or dynasty called Myrgingas, but both accounts state that he won a great kingdom as the result of his victory. A somewhat corrupt version of the same story is preserved in the Vitae duorum Offarum, where, however, the scene is transferred to England. It is very probable that the Offa whose marriage with a lady of murderous disposition is mentioned in Beowulf is the same person; and this story also appears in the Vitae duorum Offarum, though it is erroneously told of a later Offa of Mercia. Offa of Mercia, however, was a descendant in the iath generation of Offa, king of Angel. It is probable from this and other considerations that the early Offa lived in the latter part of the 4th century.<br>
