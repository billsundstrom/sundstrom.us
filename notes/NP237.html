Jacob Frederick HEGLIN
<p>
<a name ="I003766"><b>[I003766]</b></a><br />
FRED HEGLIN.<br>
Many of the well-to-do and progressive farmers of South Dakota are natives of Sweden and to this class belongs Fred Heglin, of Clay county, a member of the state legislature, who was born in Sweden in 1859 of the marriage of Hans and Brita (Anderson) Hoglund. Both parents were born in that country and the father followed farming there. Upon his emigration to America he went to Council Bluffs, Iowa, where he resided for a year, after which he came to South Dakota, taking up as a homestead the farm which is now in possession of his son Fred. The claim comprised one hundred and sixty acres, but Mr. Heglin added four hundred acres to it and became recognized as one of the energetic and successful farmers of the county. When he first came to the state, however, he was in straightened circumstances and after filing upon his homestead left his family thereon and walked to Omaha, a distance of some two hundred miles, in search of work, as there was at that time no opportunity to make a living for his family in this state, which was a wild and unsettled region. He left home with but fifty cents in his pocket and the long journey, which he made on foot is an indication of his determination and strength of will. He is still living at the advanced age of eighty-nine years and is in excellent health. His wife died in 1913. To them were born three sons: John and Peter H., who are farming in Canada; and Fred, of this review.  <br>
The last named was nine years of age when he accompanied his parents to this country and had attended school in his native land. He continued his education in the public schools of Council Bluffs, Iowa, and although quite naturally he knew no English upon entering school there, in three months he was far ahead of some in his classes. When eighteen years of age he entered the high school at Yankton, South Dakota, where he was a student until he was twenty-two years old. He then returned home and in connection with his brothers operated the farm. However, as his brothers were working for others, the greater part of the responsibility of the work of the homestead devolved upon him. In 1890 his father retired from active life and he assumed entire charge of the place. In 1894 he was elected county auditor and held that office for two terms. During that time he rented his farm and after the expiration of his second term accepted a position in the Clay County Bank, where he remained for one year. He then returned to the farm and resumed its operation. In 1912 he was elected a member of the state legislature and is at present serving his second term. He had the honor of delivering the speech nominating for United States senator Dean Sterling, who was later elected.  <br>
Mr. Heglin was married August 17, 1889, to Miss Elizabeth Ostlund, a native of Sweden, who accompanied her parents to the United States in 1868. Her father took up a homestead in Clay county but subsequently returned to Sweden, where he is now living retired. His wife died in 1890. To Mr. and Mrs. Heglin have been born the following children: Edna, who is now at home but was formerly a student in the University of South Dakota, making a special study of music; Judith, a graduate of the high school of Vermillion, who is fitting herself for a teacher; Herbert, who is a high-school student; and Wallace, who is attending the district school.  <br>
Mr. Heglin was formerly a populist but now gives his political allegiance to the Republican Party. He has held various local offices and has always taken an active interest in township and school affairs. His religious faith is that of the Lutheran church and he is a deacon in the local organization of that denomination. He has added one hundred acres to the two hundred acres of land owned by his father and the farm is one of the best developed in the county, yielding a good financial return annually. In early manhood Mr. Heglin took up the study of music and organized the Dalesburg Band, which played at a number of state fairs. He was the leader of this band from its organization in 1887 until 1903 and under his direction it became a musical organization of merit. For thirty years he has been the choir leader in the Lutheran church and in many ways has contributed to the musical development of his locality. He is a man of broad views and of well-balanced personality and gives his support to all movements that have as their object the material, moral or intellectual development of his part of the state.  <br>

Suzan Kathleen HEGLIN
<p>
<a name ="I019253"><b>[I019253]</b></a><br />
Washed up housing<br>
Don't ask, because Suzan Heglin can't tell you why, or when, she fell in love with driftwood beach huts.<br>
"I just started taking pictures because they were cute," she said.<br>
Before long, Heglin found she had quite the collection of photos; enough to maybe consider it an obsession.<br>
This year, 2008, marks the second year she's self-published a calendar of driftwood beach hut photographs through the online site www.lulu.com and she already looks to have enough photos for a 2009 version.<br>
A description on lulu.com states, "The unique calendars depict the beautiful and fanciful architecture of the huts created entirely of driftwood along the coast of the Pacific Northwest. They represent the primal longing for home and shelter, and the most romantic dreams in the most evocative places."<br>
"At this point it's really an obsession," Heglin admits.<br>
Suzan Heglin grew up in the Northridge-San Fernando area of California, but she has been a resident of Boulder, Colo., for the last 14 years.<br>
Every three months or so she can be found back on Whidbey, visiting her parents, Bobbie and Howard Heglin, who have called Oak Harbor home for close to 30 years. It is then when this writer of more than 20 years migrates to becoming a driftwood hut photographer.<br>
Heglin considers her photography of the driftwood structures as ethnography of sorts.<br>
"I tried to find any pictures on the Web or any other way people had documented driftwood huts but I couldn't,"  she said.<br>
The driftwood calendars aren't the first major publication for this veteran writer. In 2006 she published a book that had been on the back burner for 16 years, "Paula: The Lighthouse Years." The book distributed by Xlibris, is based on the true story Paula, the Estonian mail order bride of an Alaskan lighthouse keeper and their life in the 1930's.<br>
Heglin was drawn to do her calendar by a fascination with the variety in driftwood architecture.<br>
"Why are people compelled to build them," she wonders. "They're not functional, they can't necessarily protect you from the rain."<br>
And they come in all shapes and sizes: some rounded, some A-frame, some rectangular and some without entrances.<br>
"I had no idea how they intended to get in, or if they did at all," she said.<br>
Some of the huts appear simply as piles of driftwood, others are intricate creations that obviously took a lot of time. Some are accompanied by additional driftwood creativity.<br>
"One beach had skeletons in the trees that were made from driftwood and dressed as pirates," she said.<br>
Heglin also studies the altars she said often reside inside the tiny huts.<br>
"They're usually beautiful with all kinds of shells and bits of other stuff," she said. "You can't help but feel compelled to add something to it."<br>
She has to do it quickly, however, because there's often someone waiting in the car while she quickly scans and photographs the beach.<br>
"They don't let me wander too much," she said.<br>
Heglin herself has never made a driftwood hut.<br>
"I've made sand castles," she said.<br>
An explanation for both her fascination and her lack of driftwood hut building experience could lie in where she resides.<br>
"There's no equivalent in Colorado," she said. " But I am interested in tree houses, too."<br>
She can, however, give you some tips on what she's observed over time.<br>
1) The windward side of Whidbey (or any other island) is the best for hut building.<br>
"That's where all the driftwood is," she said.<br>
2) Certain beaches tend to stick with certain styles of design.<br>
"The huts are always a little rounder at City Beach and more angular at Fort Casey," she said.<br>
3) It's against driftwood hut etiquette for people to tear them down.<br>
"That'd be horrible, but if you want to add to the structure or alter it, that's OK," she said.<br>
Heglin has long wondered why people build the huts, but has never found any answers.<br>
"The builders are always gone by the time I get there," she said.<br>
The answers may be coming soon. Heglin wants to hear from people who have built driftwood huts. She wants to know why you did it, how you did it, what your structure looked like and what you used it for (shelter?).<br>
She plans to incorporate these stories, along with her photos and poetry she writes about driftwood, into a new project.<br>
"There's something here that's so unique and beautiful," she said. "It has to continue."<br>
