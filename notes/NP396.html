<a name ="I013045"><b>[I013045]</b></a><br />
Lewis Noble is the son of George W. and Adaline (1818-1876) Noble.<br>
<br>
LEWIS H. NOBLE:<br>
The subject of this sketch was born in Indiana, on the 19th day of September, 1849. His father immigrated to Ray County, Missouri, in 1854. Shortly after his arrival here, the elder Mr. Noble died, and the son was left to the care of his uncle, who trained him to the business of farming. His education was acquired in the common schools of Ray County. At the age of twenty-three years he left his uncle's home, and started out to travel in the west with the hope of improving his health, which had begun to fail. He visited Kansas, the Indian Territory, Wyoming and Idaho, spending three years altogether in his wanderings out west. He became possessed of a claim in the state of Kansas, and occupied some time in improving it; later he sold out his property there and returned to Ray County, which he always regarded as his home.<br>
He made several successive trips through the territories named above, and thus became familiar with those sections of the great west. On the 26th day of March, 1876, he was married to Miss Elizabeth Campbell, of Ray county. The result of this union was three children, all of whom are still living. Their names are: Annie A., Charles W. and Susan M. The last named two are twins. Mr. Noble has had many and varied experiences during his wild life in the west, which the limits of this work will not admit of mentioning. He is a prominent and very influential citizen of the section in which he lives, being at present, marshal of the town of Hardin. He is highly esteemed by all who know him, for his sterling qualities of heart and head. <br>

Ruth Ann NOLAN
<p>
<a name ="I027052"><b>[I027052]</b></a><br />
RAPID CITY - Ruth Ann Scanlon died on Dec. 27, 2016, in hospice care due to complications associated with cancer.<br>
Ruth was born Oct. 20, 1939, in Minneapolis to Leland E. Nolan and Mabel G. (Pederson) Nolan. She had three full siblings (Robert, Betty, and Helen) and one half brother (John "Mike" Hedlund). She lost her father when she was two years old, and her mother when Ruth was 20. She moved to Denver shortly after her motherÊ¼s death to find work. There she met William P. "Bill" Scanlon, who worked in the same accounting office, and they were married on Oct. 20, 1962.<br>
Four children followed: Patricia (53), Kathleen (52), and twins Dennis and William (50). She loved each of her children and hoped, as all parents do, that they would find happiness and success in their lives.<br>
She and Bill moved from Denver to Rapid City on June 8, 1972, and lived on Brookside Drive for 37+ years, before moving to her current home on Sunny Springs Drive. She loved the summer and early fall months, and took frequent trips into the Black Hills, particularly through Custer State Park, enjoying the fall colors, rolling hills, and the musical theatre at the Blue Bell Lodge. She enjoyed raising flowers and vegetables, and canned a delightful rhubarb jam.<br>
Her true skill was quilting and all of her children have a cherished quilt or three. Each grandchild received a quilt at graduation. She would spend the fall and winter months patiently pinning squares and patterns together while the Vikings or the Broncos struggled on the television in the background. She enjoyed football, and was a proud football parent for both her sons during their junior high and high school years.<br>
She kept several cats throughout the years, and two dogs. Cats were her favorite because they matched her personality, with their independence and stubborn streaks.<br>
A long-term parishioner at South Canyon Lutheran Church, she served as Sunday school teacher and Religious Education Coordinator for several years. She worked with teachers to host vacation bible school for several summers. Ruth was an employee of the Rapid City School District since the mid-1970s, starting as a substitute teacher, becoming a lunch-room supervisor at South Canyon Elementary in 1977, and terrorizing a generation of students thereafter. She also served in various administrative capacities at South Canyon and, in retirement, returned to substitute teaching until 2015.<br>
Travel was a passion of hers, with annual trips to Minnesota in a car full of children to visit aunts, uncles and cousins. They visited about 20 states, with frequent trips to see grandchildren in Minnesota, Colorado, Wyoming and Illinois. She and Bill also traveled to England, Ireland, Burma and Australia throughout the years.<br>
She is survived by her husband, Bill; her four children; nine grandchildren, Terry and Kelly Kline, Amanda, Kellan, and Ty Hawley, Paul Scanlon, and Zachary, Nathan, and Rebecca Scanlon; her half brother, Mike; and many nephews and nieces. Her hope is that they will find love and happiness in their lives.<br>
The Scanlon family would ask you honor the memory of Ruth by finding the time to reach out to a loved one, and remind them they are loved, to act with kindness to your children and grandchildren, and to remember that nothing in life is guaranteed - enjoy your friends and family while you can.<br>
Services will be at 2 p.m. Friday, Dec. 30, at South Canyon Lutheran Church.<br>
In lieu of flowers, the family requests a donation to the charitable organization of your choice in Ruth's name.<br>
The Scanlon family wishes to thank the staff, nurses and doctors at Regional Health and Comfort Care program for their kindness and professionalism during these difficult days.<br>
Osheim & Schmidt Funeral Home is in charge of arrangements.<br>
