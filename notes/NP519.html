Mary Lou Stevens Hammond Staunton,VA Mary Lou (Stevens) Hammond, 78, mother of Jo Ellen Hammond Opyoke, of Staunton, died Monday, October 28, 2013 at Augusta Health, Fishersville. She was born September 15, 1935, in Fairmont, WV, the daughter of the late Henry Stevens and Lucy Mildred (Kenner) Wells. As a young woman from Colfax, WV, Mary Lou worked for the Orlando Sentinel in Orlando, Florida, where she met and married William Neil Hammond of Oklahoma City in May of 1953. After having their two children in Orlando, the mountains of West Virginia called them home. For a brief time on Sunday mornings, Mary Lou sang alto in a trio with her cousin, Barbara Ellen Nichols and family friend, Anita Freeman at a small radio station in Fairmont. She also sang at Colfax UMC church in the choir. Music was an important part of her life. Prior to retirement, she worked as a florist, dental assistant and did monogramming for Jones Fur Service, all of Fairmont, WV. Mary Lou loved cooking. She passed on many a secret family recipe to anyone who wanted it. It is safe to say that she had mastered the many uses of Cream of Mushroom soup and made the best tuna casserole with potato chips on top. Mary Lou was also a voracious reader and loved good conversation. As a regular watcher of Wheel of Fortune and Jeopardy, she almost always won. Camping in their 1979 VW Pop-top van was another hobby that was shared with friends Lysbeth and Harry Huster. Camping in Seneca Rocks, WV, Pigeon Forge, TN and Canada were favorite topics of conversation and held such good memories. Family members include a son, Steven Neil Hammond; a daughter, Jo Ellen Hammond Opyoke and husband, Terry; two grandchildren, William Wayne Opyoke and wife, Bonnie, Jennie Lynn Opyoke and husband, Matt Lively; a great granddaughter, Abigail Opyoke; first cousins, Sally Hale Nims and Nancy Hale Douglas and husband, Stephen Douglas; second cousin, Amy Douglas McCarty and son, Hayden McCarty. Family in Oklahoma City, OK includes a nephew, Robert Gregg, II and family and niece, Judy Gregg and family. In addition to her husband, she was preceded in death by her mother, father, step-fathers, A.J. Arnett and Elmer Deacon Wells; a cousin, Barbara Ellen Nichols; aunt, Virginia Hale and husband, Robert Hale; and lifelong friends, Lysbeth and Harry Huster. Most importantly, she loved her family and friends totally and with all of her heart. A memorial service will be conducted at 11 a.m. on Saturday, December 7th, 2013 in the Henry Funeral Home Chapel. The family will receive friends one hour prior to the service in the funeral home. The family is ever grateful for the loving care showed their mother at the end of her life.<br>

Prior to retirement he was foreman several years at National Sea Products, Halifax, and worked in security and janitorial services, the last being in Sydney. Owen trained as a seaman, and sailed on the Gypsum King, with Fundy Gypsum Co. Some of Owen's many talents were his love of music. He played professional guitar and several other instruments sharing his gift with many including seniors and for fundraisers. Also, woodworking/carpentry. His interests were in history, genealogy, photography and the medical field. In earlier years Owen enjoyed being a Boy Scout Leader and 4H member and continued to appreciate nature and wildlife. Owen deeply loved his family, children, grandchildren who were always held close in his heart and he loved his pal "Keisha", his<br>
husky dog. Owen will be sadly missed by all that loved and knew him. His family can take comfort in knowing that God has brought him home. Besides his mother, Owen is survived by sisters, Carol, New Minas; Gloria, Kentville; children and grandchildren; several nieces, nephews and many dear friends. He was predeceased by his father; brother, John. Cremation has taken place with no visitation. A memorial service will be held Sunday, April 27, at 2 p.m. in Cheverie United Church, Cheverie.

8 months later, teams hunt for missing man<br>
Volunteer search teams are combing areas in and around Kentville for any sign of a man who vanished last summer.<br>
The search for Owen Stillman is being described as a training exercise for Annapolis Valley search and rescue volunteers, Kentville police and a police cadaver dog.<br>
Gloria Stillman is watching and waiting for any news of her brother.<br>
"We lost some very valuable time, the first 24, 48 hours of a missing person being the most important, of course," she said.<br>
Stillman said her brother was last seen Aug. 23 at the bus station in Kentville after the 60-year-old checked out of Soldiers Memorial Hospital in nearby Middleton.<br>
A bus station employee told her that Owen seemed disoriented.<br>
"When she gave him the phone he was very confused and couldn't remember my phone number," Stillman said. "Then he went outside and sat on an outside bench for some time and then wandered east."<br>
She said the RCMP opened a missing person file on Owen but it took a few days of convincing.<br>
Stillman contacted the search and rescue group, which, because it was not an official search, conducted a training exercise along an abandoned railway trail last September.<br>
A group of 22 people headed out again Tuesday when the police cadaver dog was able to join the search, focusing around the river in Kentville, said search manager Fred Bond.<br>
The training exercise continued Wednesday morning at the river and moved on to an area south of Kentville where Owen rented a room in a house.<br>
CBC News, 16 April 2008<br>
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
A man walking a dog along the Cornwallis River near Kentville the evening of April 15 discovered human remains. <br>
Military police called in RCMP and Kentville police after the body was recovered on DND property. <br>
RCMP Cst. Les Kakonyi said the body may have washed up recently, but the partially-clothed man had been dead for some time. <br>
April 21, Kentville Cpl. Ken Reid said the man was identified after forensic testing in Halifax with assistance from the Medical Examinerʼs office. <br>
Kentville police and search and rescue volunteers had searched the banks of the river Monday and Tuesday last week for a missing man, but would not confirm until April 22 a renewed search for or the discovery of the remains as those of Owen Stillman. <br>
Stillman, 60, of Canaan, checked out of Soldiers Memorial Hospital in Middleton August 23, 2007 and took a Kings Transit bus to Kentville. He got off of the bus at the transit terminal downtown, the last place he was seen. A memorial service will be held April 27 at 2 p.m. in Cheverie United Church.<br>

Dorothy Arleen STINGLEY
<p>
<a name ="I087961"><b>[I087961]</b></a><br />
Dorothy Stingley, 15, daughter of Mr. and Mrs. J. E. Stingley, who lived 12 miles north of Ord, was instantly killed when struck by lightning during the electrical storm of Tuesday evening. Her body was found by Elliott Clement, a neighbor, several hours later.<br>
The girl had started home from school shortly after 4:00, walking alone. When the electrical and rain storm broke suddenly she was evidently unable to find shelter and plodded bravely along in the pouring rain toward her home, nearly three miles from the school. County Physician P. G. Howes who examined the body, said that she was evidently struck by the lightning bolt at about 5 o'clock. The body was found at 5:30 pm by Elliott Clement.<br>
Telephone service on lines north of Ord was nearly disrupted by the storm but Clement found a phone that was in order and summoned Dr. Howes and Sheriff George Round. They left immediately for the scene of the tragedy.<br>
The body of the girl was found lying face downward in the center of the road near the Pete Knecht farm. Her hat had been torn to pieces, one shoe torn off and the sole torn from the other, and a knit jacket she wore was nearly unraveled by the force of the bolt.<br>
The sheriff and the county physician took the body to the home of the girl's parents, who had supposed Dorothy safe at the home of a neighbor. It was later brought to the Sowl funeral parlors.<br>
The girl was a member of the school in District 45, taught by Clara Clement Holmes. She was a bright high-spirited girl, a favorite of both teacher and pupils. She is survived by her mother, father and one brother.<br>
