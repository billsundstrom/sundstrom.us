Jay was born in Greencastle on January 11, 1953.<br>
He peacefully passed away on September 24, 2015 in Marion.<br>
Jay was a 1971 graduate of William Harrison High School, West Layfayette. On November 17, 1971 he enlisted in the United States Air Force where he served honorably and was discharged on March 25, 1978. While in the Air Force he studied at the University of Madrid where he became trained as a surgical technician and became fluent in the Spanish language.<br>
Jay was employed by Marion General Hospital and retired in 2007. He married Melissa Byers on August 26, 1995. Mrs. Lyon survives. Together they enjoyed traveling- especially to Mexico and Mackinac Island, Michigan. Flower and vegetable gardening was a passion for Jay. He and Melissa became known as "the tomato people" because they shared their delicious tomatoes with their out of state friends who discovered Indiana does grow the best tomatoes. In the kitchen is where Jay took command. He loved food and preparing meals to share with his family and friends. His culinary interest started at a young age and as a boy he learned how to make homemade noodles from his grandmother. Among many dishes, Jayʼs homemade beef and noodles were the best. Jayʼs other passions included listening to all genres of music (except for (c)rap music!) , photography and in his earlier years he enjoyed golfing.<br>
He will be missed for his wonderful warm smile, his great sense of humor, his ability to make everyone feel special, and the smothering of love and affection he gave to all his family.<br>

(Garrett Redweik) Lyon, Indianapolis; grandson, Lennox David Jay Redweik; brother, John Lyon, Columbus, Ohio; mother-in-law, Mary Byers, Marion; sister-in-law, Rita Bowling, Marion; nephew, Tim (Michelle) Bowling, Evansville; great-nephew, Griffin Bowling, Evansville;<br>

On March 17 1922 John Lyons, Jr., died at his home at Upchurch, Clinton county, after a snort illness of "flu" and pneumonia. He was born August 8, 1879, and was a native of Wayne county, but moved to Clinton county about ten years ago. He was married to Miss Melvina Wynn, January 8, 1905, and to this union seven children were born, all of whom survive him. Besides his wife and children he is survived by his father and mother, Mr. and Mrs. John Lyons of Cooper.; four brotners and five sisters. They are; Mrs. F.F. Upchurch of Watauga, Mrs. W.R. Wright of Monticello, Mrs. J.C. Albertson of Kidder, Mo., Mrs. Thomas Hopper of Zula, and Miss Minnie Lyons of Cooper, Edward of Nora, Isaac of Gap Creek, Fox of Winston, Mo., and Willie of Cooper.<br>
He was a member of the Stony Point Baptist church at Cartwright, and was a faithful and true Christian, always willing and ready to lend a helping hand. He was a kind and loving husband and father and was loved by all who knew him. We should not think of him as dead but sleeping the last sweet sleep of the faithful, and true child of<br>
God.<br>
Shortly before his spirit took its flight he said the gates were open. He is gone from friends and relatives for a little while but the blessed hope of meeting again is comforting to lonely hearts, but of course cannot replace his presence. The bereaved family have our heartfelt sympathy. It is sad to have to part with friends and loved ones but we must bow in submission to the will of the Master. His remains were laid to rest in the Gap Creek Cemetery to await the Resurrection morn.<br>
