<a name ="I001918"><b>[I001918]</b></a><br />
From a section on th MITCHELL CARNEGIE LIBRARY:<br>
Miss Beaulah Windle (Mrs. S. H. Scal lin), a teacher, took charge during 1886- <br>
1887; then Miss Eva Keith continued until her marriage to S. J. Mohr of Alexandria, South Dakota. In 1894, the library was reorganized and moved over a store. <br>
Frank Purdy "took over the running of the library and served as librarian" as <br>
the YMCA had been organized and "took over" where the library was housed. <br>

About her Book: Argosy<br>
"A book, an easy chair, and I can sail vast seas" The above line of poetry indicates the breadth of vision in this book of poems written by Beulah Windle Scallin and published after her death in 1938. In this book appears most of the poems she wrote throughout her life. The beauty of many of her poems is that there are lines that linger in memory. Among them is Remembrance, whose first and last lines are, "I keep no days for fast and mourning lay.....Memorial Day, for me, is every day." In nearly all her poems there is a line to remember. In Struggle the last line stands out, "Who would know life, attends a rugged school." Mrs. Scallin's poems will live in South Dakota literature for their depth of sympathy and their keen understanding of humanity. From A Tribute we read in the last line "To study glories of the past, and still not scorn the present --Progress and forward gaze."<br>

George Henry WINNER
<p>
<a name ="I026181"><b>[I026181]</b></a><br />
By Ray Finger - Staff Writer· October 27, 2008<br>
The race to represent the 53rd District in the New York Senate pits a lifelong Elmira resident and two-term incumbent Republican against a Democratic challenger who is in his second term as mayor of Elmira and works in Ithaca.<br>
With a family tree that has grown in Elmira for generations, George H. Winner Jr., 59, wants to continue to serve the region where he has lived his whole life.<br>
His great-grandfather, William T. Henry, was pastor of First Baptist Church in Elmira when John Jones, after his underground railroad activities, was church sexton and usher. Grandfather Seth Winner was a Trout Run, Pa., native who came to Elmira and operated a haberdashery. Winnerʼs father was corporation counsel for the city of Elmira for close to 20 years.<br>
Winner himself studied sociology at St. Lawrence University - and sang in a menʼs a cappella group - and initially failed to get into law school. He landed a job for the areaʼs powerful state senator, William T. Smith, and became a law clerk until he passed the bar exam and began practicing law in 1977.<br>
The next year, he was elected to the Assembly, where he served 26 years until being elected to the Senate - and joining the Republican majority - in 2004.<br>
