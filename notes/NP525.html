Susan Sullivan Stivaletta, originally from Arlington, MA, died unexpectedly the morning of October 24th 2017 at the age of 60, in her home in Franklin, MA. Susans pride and joy were her three loving children: Nicole Stivaletta Contini, wife of Leonardo Andr Contini and mother of Leonardo Andr Contini Filho, of Florianopolis, Brazil; Nicholas Stivaletta IV, husband of Nicole Trieste Stivaletta, of Rochester, NY; and Sean Phalen Stivaletta of Franklin, MA. Additionally, Susan is survived by her parents, Joan and Robert Sullivan of Woburn, MA; her 8 siblings: Maureen Cronin of Estero, FL, Joanie Bradley of Chelmsford, MA, Donna Sullivan of Woburn, MA, Robert Sullivan, Jr. of Chelmsford, MA, Jane Daddario of Medford, MA, Nancy Flynn of Beverly, MA, David Sullivan of Woburn, MA, and Judy Filipe of Lynnfield, MA, along with their spouses and many beloved nieces and nephews. She enjoyed spending time with friends and family, especially playing with her 2 year-old grandson, Leo. She delighted in the women of her book club and the coffee girls in her neighborhood. She relished cycling and fundraising with friends for Tom Bradys Best Buddies charity, embodying the spirit of working hard and playing harder. She taught us to live well and enjoy every moment; never order just an entre when there are so many appetizers and desserts to try. Live every moment like its your last, which she certainly did. Above all else, she loved caring for others and sharing her infectious laughter with all those around her. Susan was honored to be the Vice Commodore of the Falmouth Yacht Club, administrator of the Falmouth Harbor Sailing School, and had been a top broker for over 30 years, most recently at ReMax Executive Realty. Visiting hours will be held from 1-4 PM on Sunday, October 29 at Chapman, Cole & Gleason Funeral Home, 475 Main Street, Falmouth. A eulogy followed by funeral Mass will begin at 10:45 AM on Monday, October 30 at St. Patrick Church, 511 Main Street, Falmouth. Burial to follow at the Oak Grove Cemetery, Jones Road, Falmouth. In lieu of flowers, donations may be made to Gosnold on Cape Cod, 200 Ter Heun Drive, Falmouth, MA 02540, to the Brendan Daddario Scholarship Fund in memory of Susan Stivaletta.

At retirement, they moved to the Northern Neck and lived there for 12 years before moving to a retirement complex near Lancaster, Pennsylvania.<br>
They reared three children: Sarah Jane, a full-time Mom in Portland, Oregon; Rear Admiral Thomas, USN; and Dr. John, the family expert on all feathered creatures in the world. They have five grandchildren, three boys and two girls.<br>

Isaac J. SUNDLING
<p>
<a name ="I015759"><b>[I015759]</b></a><br />
Despite the information about Isaac being Lovisa's brother, it is my opinion that he was her son.  The following is from the 'History of the Swedes of Clay County, South Dakota:<br>
Isace Sundling is believed to have been a brother of Mrs. John Eric Sundstrom, and the father of Charles Sundling of Vermillion who was a resident of Beresford for many years.  His birth date is unknown, but he came to the United States for Nobottens Län, Sweden, in 1870, and to Clay County in 1872, at the time Sundstrom came.  He filed on the southeast quarter, Sec. 2, of Glenwood Township, and obtained patent after final proof, May 24, 1879.  Isaac Sundling returned to Sweden after selling his land and there are no further records of him here.  He was single while here, but may have married after returning to Sweden.<br>
