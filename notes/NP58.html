He was a successful businessman with an entrepreneurial drive having owned and operated Brown's Rest Haven in Elmira; managed five districts for an educational firm; and, as a Master Coordinator with Shaklee Corporation for almost 40 years. Through his drive, spirit, and caring, Bob was a caring man who encouraged and touched the hearts of many he came in contact with in Elmira, in Athens GA where he resided for the last 35 years, and across the country. It was Bob's wish that there not be any calling hours or funeral service. Bob preferred that all remember him for who he was and to celebrate his memory with simplicity. His cremains will be laid to rest at Forest Lawn with his parents and daughter Roberta with a family graveside service. So go fly high on the mountain, your work on earth is done. We will see you always in our hearts and with great expectation when our work is done.<br>
