Annalee Kirvan died June 8, 2009 at the Hiland Cottage hospice facility in Petoskey, ending an 89-year-old life that was marked by the strength of her faith and the depth of her love for family and friends. A former longtime resident of Ann Arbor, she was born December 7, 1919 in Gladwin, MI, the youngest of nine children belonging to Annie and Charles Partridge. A 1937 graduate of Gladwin High School, she attended nursing school at Grace Hospital in Detroit, becoming a registered nurse in 1941. A year later, on July 11, 1942 at St. Paul Episcopal Church in Gladwin, she married Stuart (Bud) Kirvan and the couple would have celebrated their 67th wedding anniversary next month. Over the course of her nursing career, she earned a reputation for kindness and compassion, working at Grace Hospital in Detroit, a Veterans Administration Hospital in Washington, D. C., and Mott Children's Hospital in Ann Arbor. While in Ann Arbor, she was an active member of St. Andrew Episcopal Church, regularly conducting neighborhood Bible studies while also supporting its ministry to help the hungry and the homeless. She continued her strong church involvement during her retirement years in Harbor Springs and Petoskey. An avid reader, she enjoyed bridge, travel, politics, and golf, recording a holeinone as a 67-year-old while playing at Birchwood Farms Country Club in Harbor Springs. For nearly 25 years, she regularly ran 3 miles a day, continuing her daily exercise routine as a walker each morning for another 15 years until her health began to steadily decline. At the heart of her life were her husband and family, which included four children, five grandsons, and one great-grandson. A beloved family figure, she generously shared her time and talents with all, serving as a role model for honesty, integrity, enthusiasm, and sense of purpose in life.

In 1892 Caroline Partridge ran the Partridge Banking House in Seneca Falls.  I assume that this is she.  However if she is not living with father-in-law in 1880 at Greenville, Greene, NY , then she may have died and the Caroline running the bank is another Cook.<br>
