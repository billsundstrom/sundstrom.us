Virginia WILBUR
<p>
<a name ="I084554"><b>[I084554]</b></a><br />
A bit of this worldʼs sparkle has dimmed: Virginia Mathis passed away on May 20, 2014 at home surrounded by her beloved family.<br>
Ginny was predeceased by her parents, Byron Wilbur and Eleanor Kerrick Wilbur. She is survived by her husband, Daniel E. Mathis, her children: Daniel Mathis (Dianne) of Trout Creek, MT, Lyndal Mathis Cole (Kevin) of Vestal, NY, Michael Mathis (Ann) of Stevensville, PA, her dear sister and best friend, Marge Tompkins, brother, Richard Wilbur, sister, Janice Soloway, grandchildren, Stephanie Heller, Christopher Lordi, Jackson Taylor, Lindsay Cole Voss, Michaela Mathis Mansergh-Wallace, Melissa Mathis, Jennifer Mosier, Shelby Ann Mathis, several great grandchildren, many nieces and nephews and special friends, Ruth Ann and Ernie Wolfe.<br>
Ginnyʼs first calling was that of devoted wife and mother but she enriched many lives in her work as Activity Director at the Towanda Memorial Hospital Skilled Nursing Unit. She treated each resident as a priceless treasure and was richly rewarded with their affection and respect.<br>
She lit the halls of the hospital with her smile and vibrant personality. Formally retiring in 1988, she continued to entertain senior citizens with plays, musicals, and various means of show on a volunteer basis. To help her community was a privilege and she did so with grace and great pleasure, working on the Camptown Alumni banquet on a consistent basis, writing columns for the Wyalusing Rocket (annual bear sightings, PHd candidate count from Spring Hill!) and making pies as requested for any and all events. <br>
Ginny had a gift for making people feel special, valuable, talented and cherished. She will be sadly missed by all who knew her just as those who knew her have been greatly blessed.<br>
The Mathis Family wishes to express thanks to Sandy Curtis of the Hair Boutique and to Guthrie Hospice for making Ginnyʼs last weeks comfortable and pleasant.<br>
A memorial service will be held Saturday, May 24, 2014 at 11:00 a.m. at the Camptown Community Church, Camptown, PA with Pastor William Westbrook and Pastor David Dewing officiating. Interment will be private.<br>
Visitation will be held from 10:15 a.m. to 11:00 a.m. Saturday morning at the church. In lieu of flowers, the family suggests that contributions be directed to the Bradford County Humane Society, PO Box 179, Ulster, PA 18850 or to Guthrie Hospice, 421 Tomahawk Road, Towanda, PA 18848 in memory of Virginia Mathis.

Mary Elizabeth WILCOX
<p>
<a name ="I046979"><b>[I046979]</b></a><br />
Mary Elizabeth Wilcox Nov. 18, 1954 ~ Jan.20, 2009 Resident of Walnut Creek Mary died unexpectedly at home in Rossmoor. Born in Richmond to Jeanne Wilcox and Max Wilcox, Jr., her earliest years were spent in El Cerrito and later in Orinda. She attended Miramonte High School, spent a semester in Stockbridge, Mass., and was a graduate of The Athenian School in Danville. With her insatiable quest for knowledge, she spent her four college years at U.C. Santa Cruz, The Monterey Institute of International Studies, The Columbia University program at University of Madrid, Spain, and earned her B.A. at U.C. Berkeley, graduating with the Class of 1976 as a Spanish Major. She went on to Hastings College of the Law where she was honored scholastically as a member of the Thurston Society from 1977 through 1978. She graduated with the Class of 1980 as a distinguished member of the 'Order of the Coif'. Mary started her practice with the firm of Miller, Starr, and Regalia where Edmund Regalia became her special friend and mentor. Eventually, Mary was appointed to the 1st District Court of Appeals in San Francisco as a research attorney working for Justice James Scott and later, Justice Gary Strankman. Probably most fulfilling was her selection by Chief Justice of the California Supreme Court, Ronald George, to become a member of his staff as research attorney. She left the Supreme Court in 1996. Mary was a member of the State Bar of California, the Rossmoor Tennis Club, and a Rossmoor library volunteer. She was also a member of the Diablo Valley Literacy Council, the Democrats of Rossmoor, and a well-loved member of a Rossmoor Wisdom Circle. Mary was mostly quiet and unassuming with an engaging smile that belied her inner struggles. It is remarkable that she was able to achieve so much in her lifetime, given the degree of anxiety and depression which began in early childhood and became increasingly overwhelming over the years. In 2005, she retired and moved to Rossmoor to be closer to her parents, providing invaluable help and support during the final months of her father's illness. She made many loyal friends in Rossmoor and enjoyed countless happy hours with her close-knit tennis group on the Rossmoor Buckeye courts. Mary was predeceased by her father, retired Superior Court Judge Max Wilcox Jr. and two sisters, Cindy McDowell and Denise Rae. She is survived by her mother, Jeanne Watson Wilcox of Rossmoor; brother, Dr. Gregory Wilcox of Davis; sister and brother-in-law, Terri and Randy Giovanetti of Danville, as well as numerous nieces and nephews. A Celebration of her Life will take place this spring, the date to be announced later. In lieu of flowers, a contribution in memory of Mary may be made to one's favorite charity.
