Jean Ruth Marlette, daughter of Mr. and Mrs. Warren Alton Marlette, 247 Fairmount Ave., and Jack Clifton Rudy, son of Mrs. Bernice J. Carlson, 138 Hedges Ave. and Vaughn S. Rudy, Sinclairville, were married Sunday in the Westminster Presbyterian Church.<br>
The Rev. Clarence F. Avey, associate pastor of the First Methodist Church in Westfieid, Mass., and uncle of the bridegroom, officiated at the double ring ceremony before an altar appointed with cone shaped baskets of white flowers accented with pink and seven branch candelabra. Satin bows marked the family pews. Miss Margaret Brodine was organist for the 3:30 p.m. nuptials.<br>
Miss Ann Louise Marlette was honor maid for her sister in an aqua satapeau bell shaped cocktail length gown with matching cluster hat and butterfly veil. She carried a cascade bouquet of sweetheart roses and delphinium. Richard and Ted Jose, cousins of the bride, were ring bearers.<br>
Daniel A. Swenson was best man and ushers were Gary Johnson and James Anderson, cousins of the bridegroom.<br>
Given in marriage by her father, the bride was gowned in white imported Swiss organdy over bridal taffeta. The molded bodice was fashioned with a bateau neckline and- elbow length sleeves edged with tucks and trimmed with Swiss lace. A row of tiny buttons outlined with narrow tucks and delicate lace accented the bodice and front panel of the gracefully bouffant bell-shaped floor touching skirt. A pert bow was tied at the front waistline. Her elbow length bouffant veil of imported silk illusion was caught to a cluster of delicate florets and pearlized buds. She carried a cascade bouquet of white sweetheart roses, stephanotis and shades of pink sweetheart roses.<br>
Mrs. Marlette wore an antique green satin faille sheath gown with variegated green velvet hat and a yellow sweetheart rose corsage. The bridegroom's mother chose a pink corsage to complement her medium blue silk crepe sheath gown with lace bodice. A velvet hat completed her ensemble. Mrs. Leonard Carlson, the bride's grandmother, was favored with a pink sweetheart rose corsage which she pinned to her navy blue dress. The bridegroom's grandmother, Mrs. Bertha Johnson, an invalid who could not attend the wedding, received a planter with pink rosebuds.<br>
A reception was held in Fellowship Hall of the church for 100 guests with Mr. and Mrs. Paul Noon, master and mistress of ceremonies. Aides were Mrs. Richard V. Fadale, Mrs. Dwight Whittemore, Mrs. Gerald Ahlstrom, Mrs. Marion Darrow, Miss Patricia Allison, Miss Mary Kettle, and Miss Alice Jose.<br>
The bride will enter Community College to take the student nurse course. Mr. Rudy is a hospital corpsman in the U.S. Navy stationed at Camp LeJeune, N.C. Both are Jamestown High School Alumni. The couple will honeymoon in the New England States.<br>
