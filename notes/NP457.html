Although Robinson designed a variety of institutional buildings as well as residences, he was best known as an architect of fire stations. He promoted himself as a "specialist in the design of fire stations." Robinson was particularly interested in housing the "fire boys." He was a frequent speaker at the meetings of firemen's associations, he published his buildings and theoretical writings in both firemen's and architects' journals. His reputation increased in the thirties and forties and fire departments throughout New England hired him to design fire stations. Between 1925 and 1940, he was responsible for several fire houses each in Quincy and Arlington, as well as numerous others across the state, including Amesbury, Gloucester, Ayer, and Mansfield, as well as Plainfield, NJ. His 1926 Central Fire Station in Arlington (pictured right) was celebrated as an octgonal station with six radiating truck bays. His work included two public high schools in Boston, the Martin Milmore Public School and the Jeremiah E. Burke High School. In his adopted town of Belmont to which he had moved in 1922, he designed the Municipal Light Department Building on Concord Avenue (1930), and the following year, the Mary Lee Burbank Elementary school. <br>
