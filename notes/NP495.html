<p>
<a name ="I089365"><b>[I089365]</b></a><br />
Lee Everet Short 1982 - 2008 Lee Everet Short, 26, beloved brother, son, fiancé and friend to all who knew him, passed away on Oct. 12th, 2008 in a tragic car accident in Salt Lake City.Lee was born on April 4th, 1982 in Port Angeles, Washington to Karen Rose Kremkau and George Lawerence Short. Karen and George were married in 1975 at the Westvale Presbyterian Church in West Valley City, Utah. As a young boy Lee was involved in athletics and enjoyed the outdoors with his dad Larry and spending time with his mom Karen going to the zoo, the park and just being an adventurous kid. At the tender age of 16 Lee was incarcerated for nine years in Washington State. Wrong place, wrong time, wrong group of friends. While locked up, Lee developed his God-given talent as an artist, sketching stunning works from nothing more than a golf pencil. Most young boys hitting hard time at that age would relinquish themselves to a life tainted with criminal actions and a hardened psyche. Lee, however, did not. He re-entered society in 2007 with his "head held high and his dignity and integrity in tact" Lee defied the odds stacked against him and successfully put his life back together, working several jobs as a video production assistant, carpenter and tattoo artist. He developed friendships quickly and with his shining personality, became a favorite with everyone to light up a room. Lee's spirit was a magnet for children as he always made time to put smiles on their faces. Lee started a family in 2007, engaged to marry his high school sweetheart Michelle Pippin and become a father to her two sweet daughters. Lee, your unwavering spirit, love of family and ability to always find happiness in the simplest things will never be forgotten. We all love you, and will miss your huge smile and enormous laugh forever. Lee is survived by mother Karen Rose Kremkau, brother Thomas Calvin Zdunich, grandmother Alyce Mae Kremkau, aunt Kristine Mae Kremkau, great aunt Francis Rubliotta, cousins Brittany Lee Hanson and Brooke Lindsay Rogers, fiancé Michelle Lynn Pippin and her daughters Namoi and Makenzie.<br>
