ITCHFIELD - Jean A. Thompson, 91, passed away peacefully at home on Friday, Feb. 5, 2021.<br>
<br>
Jean was born on May 2, 1929, the daughter of Mayford A. and Doris Hersey Morris of Richmond. She attended Richmond schools and graduated from Richmond High School. After graduation she took courses at Gorham Normal School and her first teaching position was at Longfellow School, West Gardiner. It was at the school Christmas party that she met Maxwell Eugene Thompson of West Gardiner. Jean and Gene were married on Sept. 12, 1948, in Richmond where they made their home for three years before moving to Litchfield, first to a log cabin on the western shore of Pleasant Pond and then to their current home on Jungle Lane.<br>
<br>
Jean was a woman of many talents and interests and pursued a wide variety of occupations throughout her life. She was a telephone operator at the State Hospital in Augusta. She was a salesperson at Herricks in Augusta and sold Avon and World Book Encyclopedia door-to-door. She coordinated and taught hunter safety courses throughout Maine for the Department of Fish and Wildlife. She formed a womenʼs rifle and pistol club and shot competitively. In the 1960s she started Jeanʼs Jungle, selling houseplants from her greenhouse. She was also a permanent substitute teacher in Wales and Litchfield for many years. After Gene retired, they were foster parents for infants waiting for adoption placement through The Home for Little Wanderers, Waterville. Then, for over 25 years, they cared for wounded, orphaned, and abandoned wild animals and birds at Jeanʼs Jungle Wildlife Rehabilitation Center. This volunteer job brought her much joy and satisfaction, particularly caring for the fawns. She recorded her adventures in her book JEANʼS JUNGLE, TRUE MAINE WILD ANIMAL STORIES, published in 1998. There were numerous photographs and articles about Jean and Gene in the local newspapers and on Maineʼs television stations as well as feature stories on CNN and ABCʼs 20/20.<br>
Jean was a talented artist, sewist, maker of jewelry, and she hooked rugs of her own designs. She and Gene crafted many dollhouses and she filled them with items she made. She was an excellent swimmer, hunter, and fisherman. She loved being in the woods, canoeing, bird watching, and gardening. She had musical talent as well, playing the piano and autoharp and singing in the Plains Baptist Church Choir and solos at weddings.<br>
In January 2000, Jean suffered a massive stroke which left her in a wheelchair with little use of her right side and severely limited speech. She learned to write and draw with her left hand and worked hard to communicate her thoughts. She enjoyed watching the birds and visiting with friends.<br>
Jean was predeceased by her daughter, Gail Thompson Hulsey, and by her only sibling, Mildred Hart Stengl.<br>
Jean is survived by Gene, her husband of 72 years; her daughters, Anne Thompson of Litchfield and Barbara Thompson (her husband, Wayne Thompson) of Lisbon; her grandson, Andrew Clemons (his wife, Jamie and their sons Clark and Dean) of New Albany, Ohio; her grandson, Samuel Rothman of Scarborough; and her nieces, Marcia Hart Quinby of Sedgwick and Michele Dooling of Winthrop.<br>
There will be no services at this time. Burial and a graveside service will take place in the spring at the Litchfield Plains Cemetery.<br>

Sylvia MORRIS

<a name ="I079265"><b>[I079265]</b></a><br />
Sylvia Riggle 1938 - 2007 <br>
"If I take the wings of the dawn, if I dwell in the remotest part of the sea, even there your hand will lead me." It is with joy that our eternal Father took the hand of Sylvia Riggle on January 6, 2007. Sylvia was born in Binghamton New York on September 7, 1938, the daughter of Mildred Morris. She was the youngest of four children, which included her brothers Chester and Howard Morris, and sister Ruby Jean Hastings. She is survived by her loving husband William Riggle and her nine children; Brent Clarke, Joan Buckner, Roger Clarke, Keith Clarke, Tom Riggle , Stacia Clarke, Jeremy Clarke, Kamela Verry and Ryan Clarke. Sylvia now shares her eternal life with another daughter, Kim Elyse Clarke. Sylvia would tell you that everyone of her sons and daughters-in-law were her children as well. Her life was also made joyful with 21 grandchildren. Sylvia did have a large family and many friends--in fact, family and friends is what her life was all about. An ideal setting would find her with a coffee cup in hand, sharing a story with plenty of laughter to go along with the cream while sitting at the kitchen table. Often those stories would be whipped up while she was busily baking. She loved to cook and her menu knew no limit; good eats could always be found in Sylvia 's kitchen. Sylvia was a masterful cake decorator. Many of her children's weddings were prized with her creations. And when she wasn't holding an icing bag, Sylvia might instead pick up a paint brush, wanting to express the joy of God's world with each colored stroke that breached the white backing. Sylvia loved music, making sure the joy that was found in song was imparted to her children and grandchildren. This woman loved to dole out sassy attitude and whit, and yet also possessed great empathy for anyone who was suffering or in pain. A hug, kind word or embrace were always gifts Sylvia was ready to offer someone in need. She was a woman who never knew strangers, who could find a lifetime friend from her earliest childhood, or at the checkout lane at the grocery store, or even at a drive-in theater. Perhaps the thing Sylvia understood the best was the gift that people should be to one another. Her life never made headlines, never collected wealth or was draped in fame. She simply came into this world 68-years ago. Yet her life was one of great wealth and value, yes because of the lives she touched, but even more so, because how her life was touched. This wife, mother, grandmother and friend was wonderfully and fearfully formed long ago by a creator whose love never ceased or waned. And now, Sylvia , who never met a stranger, finds the hand of her friend, her redeemer, of her king -- Jesus, holding her and leading her into the new dawn that breaks with His glory. Visitation will be held Monday, January 8, 2007 at BRINGS FUNERAL HOME, 6910 E. Broadway, from 5 p.m. to 8 p.m. Funeral services will be Tuesday, January 9, 2007, 11 a.m. at Christ Church of Tucson, 2727 Langley. The family requests that, in lieu of flowers, donations may be made to Odyssey Hospice Health Care 800-569-6605.<br>

William Henry MORRIS
<p>
<a name ="I061176"><b>[I061176]</b></a><br />
William Morris is the first born child of ten children, and a son of George Andrew Morris and Mary Angeline (Peeler) Morris. The family story is that George & Mary, along with his brothers immigrated to Washington Territory on board the Great Northern Pacific Railroad. George and his brothers, William and Jacob all claimed homesteads in the Rockford Washington area. Later George helped his son William also claim a homestead. William married Effa Iwa Ewing in 1884 in Iowa. According to his daughter Ida Belle they had thirteen children. Ida was very adamant about being in the middle of thirteen children. But we have only been able to prove the existance of ten. Several of the children had nicknames, and may have been confusing at that time, to a little girl like Ida. We know that Effa left William and went to Long Beach, California. The two youngest, Clair & Delbert along with the granddaughter Alice Blackstone, were all placed in the Northwest Children's Home about 1918. According to the NW Children's Home they were removed from an abusive home environment. All the names posted under Family Links plus these three are ones Ida gave us: Jack, Alexander Benjamin, Aly(a girl according to Ida). Several children had nicknames like Jake or Jack for Jacob, Alex or Aly for Alexander etc. <br>
They had a homestead near Rockford, WA and Grandpa William also worked as a Blacksmith. His son Jacob was apparently an apprentice Blacksmith working with his dad in 1920. Two or three children died during an epidemic in the area. According to the family story, those children were buried on the homestead near Rockford. Effa and Wm had to bury them because the local undertaker was too scared of catching what they died of. We have not been able yet to determine exactly what disease was striking that area. <br>

 PELHAM - Alvertus Jackson Morse, 80, of Pelham, died at his home on Sunday afternoon, Jan. 23, 2011, with members of his family by his side.<br>
He was known to his friends simply as "Jack." He was born in Northampton on Feb. 16, 1930, the eldest son of Alvertus D. and Drucilla Morse. He attended Northampton public schools, graduated from Amherst College in 1951, and earned his law degree from Cornell University in 1954. He was then drafted into the Army and served at Fort Dix, N.J., until 1956. He returned to Northampton to practice law with his father in the family firm, Morse & Morse.<br>
Jack Morse represented Ward 2 on the Northampton City Council for two terms starting in 1959. In 1963, after winning a Republican primary, he was unsuccessful in a bid for mayor of Northampton, a post his grandfather, also named Alvertus J. Morse, had held from 1917 to 1919. Through the 1960s and into the 1970s, Jack continued to be involved in a variety of community projects with Kiwanis, Rotary, and the Community Chest. From 1971 to 1973, he was the chairman of a nine-member Northampton Charter Committee, which first proposed to city voters several important reforms to Northampton's municipal government.<br>
In 1973, Jack was appointed by Gov. Francis W. Sargent to be a special justice in the Northampton District Court, a part-time position that became full-time in 1978, when he was named presiding justice in that court.<br>
He also sat in district courts throughout the Valley, including Holyoke, Springfield, Greenfield, and Orange. He served as a District Court judge until June 6, 1997. Within a year, he was recalled as a judge to work on care and protection cases in the Hampshire-Franklin Juvenile Court, which he did until 2006. He had a deep affection for the people who worked with him in the court system. In his retirement years, he also served for a period on the Pelham Finance Committee.<br>
Jack leaves his wife of 55 years, Carolyn; two sisters and their husbands, Deborah and Ted Pearson of Whately, and Susan and Wally Heuer of Wisconsin; three children and their spouses, Richard and Alice Morse of Amherst, Elizabeth and Robert Beane of Renton, Wash., and Stephen and Kristin Morse of Sunderland; and five grandchildren. He was predeceased in 1986 by his daughter Peggy, and then in 2009 by his brother, David, of Westhampton.<br>
A memorial service will be held Saturday, Feb. 5, at 2 p.m. at Edwards Church in Northampton with calling hours from 4-7 p.m. on Friday, Feb. 4, at the Czelusniak Funeral Home, 173 North St., Northampton.<br>

NORTHAMPTON - As a Northampton District Court judge of 25 years, Alvertus Jackson Morse used a common-sense approach in the administration of justice and was remembered here in legal circles as a kind and decent man who brought an old-school, fatherly quality to the bench.<br>
Morse, a Northampton native who also served seven years handling care and protection cases in Franklin County Juvenile Court at the end of his career, died Sunday at his Pelham home. He was 80.<br>
"He's noteworthy in terms of how he went about the business of judging," said Judge W. Michael Goggins, acting presiding judge of Northampton District Court. "He was incredibly patient and also incredibly, genuinely inquisitive about each matter that came before him. The result of that was generally whatever the matter was before him, when it was over, everybody felt that they were well heard. He had a Ward Cleaver quality to him."<br>
Morse, a Republican, whose grandfather Alvertus Jason Morse was mayor of Northampton from 1916-19, was the third generation of his family to practice law in the city, said his son, Richard Morse, of Amherst.<br>
Jack Morse graduated from Amherst College in 1951 and from Cornell Law School in 1954, and served in the Army from 1954-56 before returning to Northampton to practice law with his father, Alvertus Davis Morse. He served two terms on the Northampton City Council and ran unsuccessfully for mayor in 1963.<br>
His ascent in the halls of justice came in 1973 when, after years of closing real estate deals, drafting wills and researching land records with his family law practice, Morse was tapped by former Gov. Francis W. Sargent as a special justice.<br>
Among those who put in a good word for Morse and urged him to apply for the post at the time was Democrat John M. Callahan, Northwestern district attorney from 1971-78, who was well-connected in local political circles.<br>
"Jack was a guy who I respected immensely," Callahan said. "He was made for the district court because he was intelligent and fair and kind to people and he had a respect for the administration of justice. He did it with decency and kindness. He understood the business that was in front of him.<br>
Morse had little to no criminal trial court experience when he was appointed, but he nevertheless would develop into an outspoken and compassionate justice, say attorneys who appeared before him over the years. After six years as a special justice, Morse was named presiding judge in Northampton District Court in 1978 and served until 1997.<br>
"He always tried to do the right thing, which is what you want from a district court judge." said Northampton attorney Stella Xanthakos, who appeared before Morse as both a prosecutor and defense attorney over the course of a decade. "He had a lot of personality. He had a very big heart."<br>
Morse's common-sense approach and respect for the law shone through in one notable case that involved a woman who sprayed glue on pornographic magazines at an Amherst newsstand. Morse had ordered the woman to pay restitution to the newsstand whose magazines she ruined because, as he put it, "it's still legal to sell this garbage." But he also took the district attorney's office to task for lodging a felony charge of malicious destruction of property over $250 against the woman, which carries with it the potential for jail time, instead of a misdemeanor charge. The glue involved, Elmer's in this case, apparently tarnished a book case harboring the magazines.<br>
"He made some comment about having used Elmer's glue for years and years and that one could just wash it off with soap and water," Xanthakos recalled. "He used common sense and that's what he was known for."<br>
Morse was respected by area lawyers who observed him in closed-door care and protection hearings involving parents suspected of abusing or neglecting their children, involuntary commitment hearings for former state hospital patients who sought to be released against the will of hospital officials, and hearings for patients who do not want medication when hospital psychiatrists say it is necessary.<br>
"He cared about the outcome a lot ... when a lot of people weren't caring about these cases in those days," said Northampton attorney Thomas Lesser. "He cared a lot about young people, a lot about what happened to young people."<br>
Shortly after leaving Northampton District Court, Morse was called back to handle care and protection cases in Franklin County Juvenile Court, which he did for seven years.<br>
"Those are emotional and protracted cases," Goggins said. "Not a lot of guys would have done that. That was hard, hard work."<br>
In a Gazette interview in 1989, more than a decade after being named presiding district court judge, Morse said he never let his position of authority get to his head, or as he put it, "a feeling that I'm some kind of God Almighty."<br>
"That's something that I always resented," he said. "When judges put on their robes and forget they are lawyers. Sometimes they forget they are a member of the human race."<br>
Funeral plans were incomplete Monday. Czelusniak Funeral Home is in charge of arrangements. <br>
