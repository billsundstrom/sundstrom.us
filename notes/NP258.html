<a name ="I024103"><b>[I024103]</b></a><br />
Chuck Howard, a former producer at ABC Sports and winner of 11 Emmy Awards, died yesterday at his home in Pound Ridge, N.Y. He was 63.<br>
The cause was a brain tumor, his family said.<br>
In 1960, Mr. Howard took a career detour from Chase Manhattan Bank to become a production assistant at ABC Sports. He remained there for 26 years and is credited with being the first to use a split screen and an isolated camera to highlight a part of a play away from the main action.<br>
He became the vice president of production in 1968 and was part of the network's production teams for various events, including the Summer and Winter Olympics, the Super Bowl, the World Series and ''Wide World of Sports.''<br>
After Mr. Howard left ABC in 1986, he became the executive producer for the Big Ten Conference's football and basketball broadcasts. Three years later, he was named the executive producer of Trans World International, overseeing the production of figure skating and tennis events, the New York City Marathon, the America's Cup and world coverage of the Masters golf tournament.<br>
''As a producer he had a great ability to follow the story line,'' said Barry Frank, who worked with Mr. Howard at ABC and is president of Trans World, a subsidiary of the International Management Group. ''A lot of producers see a game from shot to shot or play to play, but don't see the storyline. Chuck was able to find it and follow it. He trained so many of today's best producers.''<br>
Mr. Howard is survived by his wife, Carolyn; three daughters, Dana, Dawn and Caroline, and a son, Christopher.<br>
<br>
From Wikapedia:<br>
Charles (Chuck) Howard graduated from Duke University in 1955. He was a member of the Beta Theta Pi fraternity.<br>
Howard was a production assistant at Edgar J. Scherick's company, Sports Programs, Inc., in 1961 when Roone Arledge charged him with scouting sports events throughout the world in an effort to discover sports that had a loyal following but might be unknown to American television viewers. The result was the April 21, 1961 debut of Wide World of Sports on ABC Sports, the groundbreaking television sports program.<br>
Arledge, Howard and commentator Jim McKay created the show on a week-by-week basis during its first year of broadcast, establishing a sports television tradition in the process.<br>
Howard went on to become a vice president for programming at ABC Sports and covered nine Olympic Games, the Super Bowl, World Series, British Open, Kentucky Derby, Indianapolis 500 and NCAA football -- as well as Acapulco cliff diving, Demolition Derby, rodeos, bobsled racing, arm wrestling and Evel Knievel's daredevil antics.<br>
On April 8, 1967, due to an AFTRA strike, Howard and director Chet Forte filled-in as commentators for Game 4 of the NBA Eastern Conference Finals between the Boston Celtics and Philadelphia 76ers. He oversaw the broadcast of the 1972 Summer Olympics in Munich, Germany, notable for the massacre of 11 Israeli team members by Palestinian terrorists.<br>
In 1986, Howard left ABC and became executive producer at Trans World International.<br>
Howard died of brain cancer on November 21, 1996 in Pound Ridge, New York.<br>
