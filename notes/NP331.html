Peter Raphael LOSTER
<p>
<a name ="I022976"><b>[I022976]</b></a><br />
Peter Raphael Loster, of Vernon, British Columbia and formerly of Yorkton, Saskatchewan, passed away peacefully on January 14, 2012 at the North Okanagan Hospice House after a courageous battle with leukemia. He was 51 years of age. Peter, the son of Leonard and Eleanor Loster, grew up in Yorkton and completed his elementary school in the separate school system. He went to St. Joseph ºs Junior High and Sacred Heart High school where he became very active in the Drama Club. This interest was rekindled later in his life as Peter was involved with the Yorkton Theatre Group. During his high school years, most weekends and summer holidays were spent with his Konesceni "brothers" at Ray and Mary ºs farm near Dysart, Saskatchewan. After graduation, Peter worked at a variety of jobs including the Games Gallery, the City of Yorkton - Water Treatment Plant, Deer Park Golf Course, CJGX Radio and for the past 23 years at Canada Post. He transferred to Vernon, British Columbia with Canada Post in 2006. This afforded him the opportunity to revisit his interest in acting and pursue a part-time acting career. He joined the Powerhouse Theatre in casting and production as well as participating in commercials, documentaries and silent parts on the big screen. Peter also formed many cherished friendships in the area. Throughout his life, he was an avid sports fan, dedicated to his beloved Boston Bruins, New Jersey Devils, Seattle Seahawks, Saskatchewan Roughriders, Yorkton Terriers and for the past five years - the Vernon Vipers. He was actively involved in baseball, slow pitch, shinny and recently curling. He enjoyed golf and fishing with his buddies and his nephews. He also coached Special Olympics and was an avid dart player. Pete ºs vast collection of music provided solace for him. No day was complete without coffee with "the boys" and/or lunch at the "Greeks" (George and Cimos). Being with his friends and family whatever the occasion was his favourite way of spending time. Pete was a man of simple means. He lived life in his own way and on his own terms. Pete would selflessly lend a hand to anyone in need in his own unassuming way and never sought any recognition for it. His positive attitude, contagious smile and grand personality endeared him to everyone he met. Pete ºs wit and sense of humour carried him through many personal and medical obstacles in his infancy, early childhood, mid-life years and most recently when he was diagnosed with a malignant brain tumour in 2002. Along with the tremendous support he received from his network of close friends and family, his faith and determination to "beat it" sustained him for nine years. Then in 2011, when the tumour resurfaced along with a secondary diagnosis of acute leukemia, he continued to travel yet another difficult journey with conviction and hope. Pete ºs family would like his friends and family to remember - If you think that you were inspired by Peter; know that you also inspired him and gave him the courage to continue. When you remember Pete know that each and every one of you had an important place in his life and in his memories. Peter was predeceased by his parents, Leonard and Eleanor Loster; his brother, John; his stepson, Donnie Herman and his father-in-law, Alf Falkowsky. He leaves to mourn his loss, his stepson, Paul Herman (Stacey Pfeifer) and Paul ºs mother, Sharon; his three beloved furry kids - his cats, Rringo, Wrocko and Dude; his brothers, Len (Evelyn) and Murray (Cheryl); his sisters, Shirley Pierce and Steph (Rick) Young; his sister-in-law, Glenda Loster as well as numerous nieces, nephews and MANY wonderful friends. A social to celebrate his life was held in Vernon, BC on January 21, 2012.<br>

Lothair II of LOTHARINGIA
<p>
<a name ="I005420"><b>[I005420]</b></a><br />
Lothair (825 - August 8, 869), was the second son of the emperor Lothair I. On his father's death in 855, he received for his kingdom a district lying west of the Rhine, between the North Sea and the Jura mountains, which was called Regnum Lotharii and early in the 10th century became known as Lotharingia or Lorraine (the later duchy of Lorraine). His elder brother Louis II received Italy and the title of Emperor, and his younger brother Charles received Burgundy and the Provence.<br>
<br>
On the death of his brother Charles in 863 Lothair added some lands south of the Jura to this inheritance, but, except for a few feeble expeditions against the Danish pirates, he seems to have done little for its government or its defence.<br>
<br>
The reign was chiefly occupied by efforts on the part of Lothair to obtain a divorce from his wife Teutberga, a sister of Hucbert, abbot of St Maurice (d. 864); and his relations with his uncles Charles the Bald and Louis the German, were influenced by his desire to obtain their support to this plan. Although quarrels and reconciliations between the three kings followed each other in quick succession, in general it may be said that Louis favoured the divorce, and Charles opposed it, while neither lost sight of the fact that Lothair had no sons to inherit his lands. Lothair, whose desire for the divorce was prompted by his affection for a certain Waldrada, put away Teutberga; but Hucbert took up arms on her behalf, and after she had submitted successfully to the ordeal of water, Lothair was compelled to restore her in 858. Still pursuing his purpose, he won the support of his brother, the emperor Louis II, by a cession of lands, and obtained the consent of the local clergy to the divorce and to his marriage with Waldrada, which took place in 862.<br>
<br>
A synod of Frankish bishops met at Metz in 863 and confirmed this decision, but Teutberga fled to the court of Charles the Bald, and Pope Nicholas I declared against the decision of the synod. An attack on Rome by the emperor was without result, and in 865 Lothair, convinced that Louis and Charles at their recent meeting had discussed the partition of his kingdom, and threatened with excommunication, again took back his wife. Teutberga, however, either from inclination or compulsion, now expressed her desire for a divorce, and Lothair went to Italy to obtain the assent of the new Pope Adrian II. Placing a favourable interpretation upon the words of the pope, he had set out on the return journey, when he was seized with fever and died at Piacenza on the August 8, 869. He left, by Waldrada, a son Hugo who was declared illegitimate, and his kingdom was divided between his uncles Charles the Bald and Louis the German by the Treaty of Mersen.<br>
