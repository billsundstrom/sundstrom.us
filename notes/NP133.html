Emma DE NORMANDY
<p>
<a name ="I008658"><b>[I008658]</b></a><br />
From Wikipedia<br>
<br>
Emma (c. 988-March 6, 1052), daughter of Richard I, Duke of Normandy, by his second wife Gunnora, was twice queen of England, by marriage first (1002-1016) to king Ethelred the Unready and then (1017-1035) to Canute, king also of Denmark and Norway. Two of her sons - one by each husband - and two step-sons also became king of England, as did her great-nephew, William the Conqueror.<br>
<br>
Upon the Danish invasion of England in 1013, Emma took her sons by Ethelred - Alfred and Edward - to Normandy, where they remained upon her return to England to marry Canute, now king of England following the death of Ethelred and his son (her step-son) Edmund Ironside.<br>
<br>
Following Canute's death, Alfred and Edward returned in 1036, possibly in an attempt to overthrow Canute's illegitimate son Harold Harefoot, who had established himself as ruler in the absence of Harthacanute, son of Canute and Emma. Alfred was captured and died after being blinded, while Edward escaped to Normandy, followed by his mother.<br>
<br>
The death of Harold in 1040 and the accession of the more conciliatory Harthacanute paved the way for Edward's return to England the next year as co-ruler and (1042) king on Harthacanute's death. Emma returned to end her days at Winchester, Hampshire, where she was buried alongside Canute.<br>
<br>
Emma's marriages and subsequent role forged the link between England and Normandy which was to culminate in her great-nephew William of Normandy's invasion of England in 1066.<br>

Richard I DE NORMANDY
<p>
<a name ="I005232"><b>[I005232]</b></a><br />
From Wikipedia<br>
<br>
Richard I of Normandy (c.935 - November 20, 996) was the Duke of Normandy from 942 to 996. He was called Richard the Fearless<br>
Birth<br>
<br>
He was born to William I of Normandy, Duke of Normandy, and Sprota. His date of birth is unknown, but he was still a boy when his father died in 942. His mother was a Breton concubine captured in war and bound to William by a Danish marriage. After William died, Sprota became the wife of Esperleng, a wealthy miller.<br>
<br>
Life<br>
Richard was still a boy when his father died, and so he was powerless to stop Louis IV of France when he seized Normandy. Richard escaped from his prison at Laon, allied himself with Norman and Viking leaders, drove Louis out of Rouen, and took back Normandy by 947.<br>
<br>
Marriages<br>
He was first married to Emma of Paris (Duchess of Normandy) in 960. She died after 966, with no issue.<br>
<br>
According to Robert of Torigny, not long after Emma's death, Duke Richard went out hunting and stopped at the house of a local forester. He became enamoured of the forester's wife, Seinfreda, but she being a virtuous woman, suggested he court her unmarried sister, Gunnor, instead. Gunnor became his bride, and her family rose to prominence. Her brother, Herefast de Crepon, was involved in a controversial trial involving the Cathars. She was, like Richard, of Norse descent, being a Dane by blood. Richard finally married her to legitimate their children:<br>
    * Richard II, Duke of Normandy (The Good),<br>
    * Robert, Archbishop of Rouen, Count of Evreux, died 1037.<br>
    * Mauger, Earl of Corbeil, died after 1033.<br>
    * Robert Danus, died between 985/989.<br>
    * Emma of Normandy, died 1052.<br>
    * Hawise of Normandy, wife of Geoffrey I, Duke of Brittany.<br>
    * Maud of Normandy, wife of Odo II of Blois, Count of Blois, Champagne and Chartres.<br>
<br>
Mistresses<br>
Richard was known to have had several mistresses and produced childen with many of them. Known children are:<br>
    * Geoffrey, Count of Brionne, (b. ca. 970)<br>
    * Hawise (b. ca. 978), d. 21 Feb 1034. m. Geoffrey of Brittany, Duke of Brittany, (ca. 997), son of Conan I of Brittany, Duke of Brittany, "le Tort", and Ermengarde of Anjou.<br>
    * William d'Eu, Count d'Eu, (b. ca. 985).<br>

<a name ="I006386"><b>[I006386]</b></a><br />
From Wikipedia<br>
<br>
Richard III of Normandy, Son of Richard II, who died in 1027, leaving the Duchy of Normandy to his eldest son. Although the eldest son, Richard mysteriously died soon after his father, leaving the duchy to his younger brother Robert I, sixth Duke of Normandy and direct ascendant of the present-day British royal family. Richard reigned for a few months and never really had any effect on the Duchy of Normandy. He had children from two unknown mistreses.<br>
Children:<br>
    * Alice of Normandy<br>
    * Agnes D'Evreux<br>
</p>
Robert II DE NORMANDY
<p>
<a name ="I005227"><b>[I005227]</b></a><br />
From Wikipedia<br>
<br>
Robert was Called "The Magnificent" (French, "le Magnifique") for his love of finery. He was the son of Duke Richard II of Normandy and Judith, daughter of Conan I, Duke of Brittany.<br>
When his father died, his elder brother Richard succeeded, whilst he became Count of Hiémois. When Richard died a year later, there were great suspicions that Robert had Richard murdered, hence his other nickname, "Robert le diable" (the devil). He is often mis-identified with the legendary Robert the Devil.<br>
Robert aided King Henry I of France against Henry's rebellious brother and mother, and for his help he was given the territory of the Vexin. He also intervened in the affairs of Flanders, supported Edward the Confessor, who was then in exile at Robert's court, and sponsored monastic reform in Normandy.<br>
By his mistress, Herleva, he was father of the future William the Conqueror. An illegitimate daughter, Adelaide, became Countess of Ponthieu and Countess of Champagne.<br>
After making his illegitimate son William his heir, he made a pilgrimage to Jerusalem and died at Nicaea between 1-3 of July, 1035. His son William, aged about eight, succeeded him.<br>
</p>
William I DE NORMANDY
<p>
<a name ="I005228"><b>[I005228]</b></a><br />
From Wikipedia<br>
<br>
William I (c. 1028 - September 9, 1087), was King of England from 1066 to 1087. Known alternatively as William of Normandy, William the Conqueror and William the Bastard, he was the illegitimate and only son of Robert the Magnificent, Duke of Normandy, and Herleva, the daughter of Fulbert, a tanner. Born in Falaise, Normandy, now in France, William succeeded to the throne of England by right of conquest by winning the Battle of Hastings in 1066 in what has become known as the Norman Conquest.<br>
<br>
No authentic portrait of William has been found. In the patriotic print he is wearing plate armour that was invented generations after his death. He was described as a big burly man, strong in every sense of the word, balding in front but of regal dignity.<br>
<br>
Early life history<br>
William was born the grandnephew of Queen Emma, wife of King Ethelred the Unready and later of King Canute.<br>
<br>
William succeeded to his father's Duchy of Normandy at the young age of 7 in 1035 and was known as Duke William II of Normandy. He lost three guardians to plots to usurp his place. Count Alan of Brittany was a later guardian. King Henry I of France knighted him at the age of 15. By the time he turned 19 he was himself successfully dealing with threats of rebellion and invasion. With the assistance of King Henry, William finally secured control of Normandy by defeating the rebel Norman barons at Caen in the Battle of Val-ès-Dunes in 1047.<br>
<br>
He married Matilda of Flanders, against the wishes of the pope in 1053 at the Cathedral of Notre Dame at Eu, Normandy (now in Seine-Maritime). He was 26, she was 22. Their marriage produced four sons and six daughters (see list below).<br>
<br>
His half-brothers Odo of Bayeux and Robert, Count of Mortain played significant roles in his life.<br>
<br>
Conquest of England<br>
Upon the death of William's cousin King Edward the Confessor of England (January 1066), William claimed the throne of England, asserting that the childless and celibate Edward had named him his heir during a visit by William (probably in 1052) and that Harold Godwinson, England's foremost magnate, had reportedly pledged his support while shipwrecked in Normandy (c. 1064). Harold made this pledge while in captivity and was reportedly tricked into swearing on a saint's bones that he would give the throne to William. Even if this story is true, however, Harold made the promise under duress and so may have felt free to break it.<br>
<br>
The assembly of England's leading notables known as the Witenagemot approved Harold Godwinsonʼs coronation which took place on January 5, 1066 making him King Harold II of England. In order to pursue his own claim, William obtained the Pope's support for his cause. He assembled an invasion fleet of around 600 ships and an army of 7000 men. He landed at Pevensey in Sussex on September 28, 1066 and assembled a prefabricated wooden castle near Hastings as a base. This was a direct provocation to Harold Godwinson as this area of Sussex was Harold's own personal estate, and William began immediately to lay waste to the land. It may have prompted Harold to respond immediately and in haste rather than await reinforcements in London.<br>
<br>
King Harold Godwinson was in the north of England and had just defeated another rival, King Hardrada of Norway supported by his own brother Tostig. He marched an army of similar size to William's 250 miles in 9 days to challenge him at the crucial battle of Senla, which later became known as the Battle of Hastings. This took place on October 14, 1066. According to some accounts, perhaps based on an interpretation of the Bayeux Tapestry commemorating the Norman victory, Harold was killed by an arrow through the eye, and the Anglo Saxon forces fled giving William victory.<br>
<br>
This was the defining moment of what is now known as the Norman Conquest. The remaining Saxon noblemen surrendered to William at Berkhamsted, Hertfordshire and he was acclaimed King of England there. William was then crowned on December 25, 1066 in Westminster Abbey.<br>
<br>
Although the south of England submitted quickly to Norman rule, resistance continued, especially in the North for six more years until 1072. Harold's sons attempted an invasion of the south-west peninsula. Risings occurred in the Welsh Marches and at Stafford. Most seriously William faced separate attempts at invasion by the Danes and the Scots. William's defeat of these led to what became known as the The Harrowing of the North in which Northumbria was laid waste to deny his enemies its resources. The last serious resistance came with the Revolt of the Earls in 1075.<br>
<br>
William's reign<br>
William initiated many major changes. In 1085, in order to ascertain the extent of his dominion, William commissioned the compilation of the Domesday Book, a survey of England's productive capacity similar to a modern census. He also ordered the building of a number of castles, among them the Tower of London. His conquest also led to Norman French replacing English as the language of the ruling classes, for nearly 300 years.<br>
<br>
William is said to have deported large numbers of the old landed classes into slavery through Bristol. Many of the latter ending up in Umayyad Spain and Moorish lands, converting and taking high positions in the state.<br>
<br>
He died aged 60 at the Convent of St. Gervais, near Rouen, France, on September 9, 1087 from abdominal injuries received from his saddle pommel when he fell off a horse at the Siege of Mantes. He was buried in the Saint Peter's Church in Caen, Normandy. In a most unregal postmortem, William's corpulent body would not fit in the stone sarcophagus, and burst after some unsuccessful prodding by the assembled bishops, filling the chapel with a foul smell and dispersing the mourners.<br>
<br>
William was succeeded in 1087 as King of England by his younger son William Rufus and as Duke of Normandy by his elder son Robert Curthose. This led to the Rebellion of 1088. His youngest son Henry also became King of England later, after William II died without a child to succeed him.<br>
<br>
Children of William the Conqueror and Matilda of Flanders<br>
Some doubt exists over how many daughters there were. This list includes some entries which are obscure.<br>
   1. Robert Curthose (c. 1054-1134), Duke of Normandy, married Sybil of Conversano, daughter of Geoffrey of Conversano<br>
   2. Adeliza (or Alice) (c. 1055-?), reportedly betrothed to Harold II of England (Her existence is in some doubt.)<br>
   3. Cecilia (or Cecily) (c. 1056-1126), Abbess of Holy Trinity, Caen<br>
   4. William Rufus (1056-1100), King of England<br>
   5. Richard (1057-c. 1081), killed by a stag in New Forest<br>
   6. Adela (c. 1062-1138), married Stephen, Count of Blois<br>
   7. Agatha (c. 1064-c. 1080), betrothed to (1) Harold of Wessex, (2) Alfonso VI of Castile<br>
   8. Constance (c. 1066-1090), married Alan IV Fergent, Duke of Brittany; poisoned, possibly by her own servants<br>
   9. Matilda (very obscure, her existence is in some doubt)<br>
  10. Henry Beauclerc (1068-1135), King of England, married (1) Matilda (or Edith) of Scotland, daughter of Malcolm III, King of Scotland, (2) Adeliza of Louvain<br>

</p>
Fortun Garces DE PAMPLONA
<p>
<a name ="I015183"><b>[I015183]</b></a><br />
From Wikipedia<br>
<br>
Fortun Garces the One-Eyed or the Monk (d. aft. 925) was the King of Pamplona reigning at least 882-905.<br>
<br>
He was the eldest son of King Garcia Iniguez, himself the son of king Eneko Aritza. His mother may have been Urraca of Aragon.<br>
<br>
Fortun may have had one or more kinsmen as co-kings during his reign: Garcia II Jimenez, Inigo II Garces, possibly Sancho I Garces, members of the Jimenez line of the Basque dynasty. Fortun was to be the last king of the Aritza line.<br>
<br>
Prince Fortun was taken prisoner by the Moors in 860 in conjunction with the invasion of Emir Mohamed I of Cordoba and was kept the next 20 years imprisoned by the enemies.<br>
<br>
His father died in 870, while Fortun was a prisoner in Cordoba. The kingdom was governed by the Regent, Garcia II of Pamplona.<br>
<br>
Fortun was released in 880, and upon his return to Pamplona, was apparently recognized as king.<br>
<br>
The regent and co-king Garcia II was killed at Ayhar in 882 in a battle against the Emir of Cordoba, and from this onwards, Fortun apparently was the sole or the chief king of Pamplona.<br>
<br>
During his reign, the kingdom suffered from various military expeditions.<br>
<br>
Lope ibn Muhammad was the head of Banu Qasi in that period.<br>
<br>
An alliance of enemies of the Banu Qasi, the king Alfonso III of Asturias and count of Pailhars, brought about a coup. This probably took place in and after 905, although sources are sketchy and unclear.<br>
<br>
After a reign of twenty-two years, Fortun decided to become a monk at Leyra, the oldest convent in Navarre, to which no less than seventy-two other convents were subject. He was the last monarch of the male line of Eneko Aritza.<br>
<br>
His kinsman Sancho I of Pamplona (Sancho Garces, son of Garcia Jimenez the Regent, co-king) was the choice of the Navarrese to succeed him. Sancho I ascended in 905.<br>
<br>
Fortun had several surviving children: sons Inigo, Aznar, Blasco and Lope, as well as a daughter, Oneca Fortunez, who in 847 married Abd Allah, Emir of Cordoba, and secondly her cousin Aznar Sanchez of Larraun, becoming the mother of the future queen Toda Aznarez, second wife of Sancho I of Pamplona.<br>
</p>
Garcia I Iñiguez DE PAMPLONA
<p>
<a name ="I015188"><b>[I015188]</b></a><br />
From Wikipedia<br>
<br>
Garcia Iniguez (d. 870) was King of Pamplona bef. 860-870. He was educated in Cordoba, as a guest of the Muslims.<br>
<br>
He was the son of Eneko Aritza, the first king of this dynasty. When his father was stricken by paralysis in 842, he became Regent.<br>
<br>
His kinsman Musa ibn Musa of Banu Qasi rebelled against the Cordoban emir in 843. This rebellion was put down by Emir Abd al-Rahman II, who also attacked the Kingdom of Pamplona, vanquishing Garcia Iniguez and Musa.<br>
<br>
Garcia succeeded as undisputed monarch only after his kinsman, Ximeno Garces, heir of Alava, who had in 851/2 succeeded Aritza and united more territories to the new kingdom. In 860, the united Pamplonese and Navarrese gave the Crown to him.<br>
<br>
In 859 a contingent of Vikings made an expedition to Navarrese lands. The Pamplonan government abandoned the old alliance with Banu Qasi and made a new pact with the kings of Asturias. Ordono I of Asturias and Garcia Iniguez triumphed in the Battle of Albelda in 859.<br>
<br>
Garcia's son and heir Fortun was imprisoned by the Moors in 860 and was kept in Cordoba for the next 20 years.<br>
<br>
Garcia I favored the pilgrims who travelled to Santiago de Compostela, and attempted to guarantee peace for that traffic.<br>
<br>
Garcia zealously defended his country against the encroachments of Islam.<br>
<br>
In 870, Garcia died. As his heir was in the hands of his enemies, a kinsman Garcia Jimenez governed the kingdom as Regent or even as co-king. Garcia's son Fortun Garces was released in 880, and when returned, became king of Pamplona.<br>
<br>
Garcia I married firstly in 858 Oria (Leodegundis), daughter of Musà ibn Musà Ibn Fortún of Banu Qasi, and secondly Urraca Giménez, Countess of Aragón (852-870).<br>
</p>
Garcı́a Sanchez I DE PAMPLONA
<p>
<a name ="I015158"><b>[I015158]</b></a><br />
Garcia III Sanchez (c. 919-970) was King of Pamplona until 970.<br>
<br>
He was the son of Sancho Garces and Toda Aznarez. His father was very old at his birth, and died in 925. Garcia's mother took over as his regent and Garcia's uncle Jimeno became king or co-king. Jimeno died in 931, after which the underage Garcia was the sole king.<br>
<br>
Through his mother, Garcia was a great-grandson of king Fortun Garces who had ceased to reign in 905 when imprisoned by enemies, but lived on until Garcia's own reign as a monk in Leyra.<br>
<br>
With the support, of his energetic and diplomatic mother, Garcia, like his father, engaged in a number of conflicts with the Moors. He married Andregoto, heiress of Aragon, but divorced her.<br>
<br>
Garcia was succeeded by his son Sancho II Garces, nicknamed Abarca, who apparently was the first historic King of Navarre or the first to use the style "of Navarre" rather than "of Pamplona".<br>
</p>
Jimeno I Garces DE PAMPLONA
<p>
<a name ="I015185"><b>[I015185]</b></a><br />
Jimeno Garces was chosen to succeed his kinsman Eneko Aritza as King of Pamplona in 851 or 852. He was apparently the son of Garcia Jimenez, who was probably lord of Alava and possibly a Duke of Gascony/Vasconia during the time of King Inigo. His accession apparently united these two Basque territories. In 860, however, the united Pamplonese and Navarrese gave the Crown to the son of Aritza, Garcia Iniguez. Jimeno's own son Garcia Jimenez apparently became co-King of Pamplona sometime during the next reign. In the 10th century, Jimeno's line completely displaced the line of Aritza, and his male line reigned in Navarre until 1234.<br>
</p>
Sancho I Garces DE PAMPLONA
<p>
<a name ="I015180"><b>[I015180]</b></a><br />
From Wikipedia<br>
<br>
Sancho Garces (c. 860s - December 11, 925) was King of Pamplona 905-925.<br>
<br>
He was a son of Garcia Jimenez, who was Regent of Pamplona 870-880 and apparently co-king of Pamplona from 860 up to 882. Sancho may also have been a co-king during the reign of Fortun I of Pamplona.<br>
<br>
The elderly Sancho succeeded King Fortun Garces when the latter was deposed by his enemies in 905.<br>
<br>
Sancho's first wife Urraca, daughter of count of Aragon, did not have surviving children. Thus, Sancho's heirs were his children from his second marriage with queen Toda Aznarez and were born in his last decade of life, when he was an old man. Their minority led to special arrangements in the succession.<br>
<br>
Queen Toda Aznarez (Teuda of Larraun) was a daughter of Aznar Sanchez, lord of Larraun, cadet of the Aritza line of kings of Pamplona, and of his wife Oneca Fortunez who herself was a daughter of Fortun Garces. Thus, Toda's children also descended from the first kings of Pamplona, the Iniguez line.<br>
<br>
Sancho I Garces fought against the Moors with repeated success and joined Ultra-Puertos, or Basse-Navarre, to his own dominions, also extending its territory as far as Najera. As a thank-offering for his victories, he founded, in 924, the convent of Albelda. Before his death, all Moors had been driven from the country.<br>
<br>
King Sancho Garces was succeeded by his brother Jimeno, but his young son Garcia Sanchez also received the royal title, and after Jimeno's death in 931, the young Garcia became the sole king.<br>

Henry DE PERCY
<p>
<a name ="I007571"><b>[I007571]</b></a><br />
From Wikipedia<br>
<br>
Henry Percy, 2nd Earl of Northumberland, (3 February 1392 /1393 - 22 May 1455) was the son of Henry Percy and his wife Elizabeth de Mortimer, daughter of Edmund Mortimer, 3rd Earl of March and Philippa Plantagenet.<br>
<br>
He was restored to favor in 1416 by Henry V of England, receiving the estates of his paternal grandfather Henry Percy, 1st Earl of Northumberland the re-creation of his earldom.<br>
<br>
He was apparently loyal to Henry V till the death of the later on 31 August 1422. Henry V was succeeded by his one-year-old son Henry VI of England. Percy was on the regency council in the early years of the new reign.<br>
<br>
Percy was later involved in the Wars of the Roses which placed him in an awkward situation. He owed his loyalty to the House of Lancaster but was first cousin of Anne Mortimer and kinsman to her son Richard, Duke of York, head of the House of York.

Harry acquired a great reputation as a warrior, fighting against the Scots and the French. He fought against the Scots at the Battle of Otterburn in 1388 and was captured, but later ransomed. He went to Calais in 1391 and served as governor of Bordeaux from 1393 to 1395.<br>

Later with his uncle Thomas Percy, Earl of Worcester, he led a rebellion against King Henry IV in 1403, forming an alliance with the Welsh rebel, Owain Glyndwr. Before they could join forces, Hotspur was defeated and killed at the Battle of Shrewsbury. He is a major character in Shakespeare's Henry IV, Part 1, though in the play he is portrayed as being of the same age as his main rival Prince Hal, when in fact he was considerably older.<br>

Henry DE PERCY
<p>
<a name ="I008459"><b>[I008459]</b></a><br />
Henry Percy, 1st Earl of Northumberland (November 10, 1341 - February 20, 1408), was the son of Henry, 3rd baron Percy, and the father of Henry "Harry Hotspur" Percy. His mother was Mary of Lancaster, daughter of Henry Plantagenet, 3rd Earl of Leicester, son Edmund Crouchback, son of Henry III of England.<br>
<br>
Originally a follower of Edward III of England, for whom he held high offices in the administration of northern England, Henry Percy went on to support King Richard II. He was given the title of Marshal of England and created an earl at Richard's coronation (1377), but he switched to the side of Henry Bolingbroke (later, Henry IV) after Richard created his chief rival, Ralph Neville, 1st earl of Westmorland in 1399. On Henry's coronation he was appointed Constable of England and granted the lordship of the Isle of Man. In 1403 Percy turned against Henry IV in favor of Edmund Mortimer, 5th Earl of March, and then conspired with Owen Glendower against King Henry. This rebellion failed at the Battle of Shrewsbury but, since Percy did not directly participate, he lost his office as Constable but was not convicted of treason. But in 1405 Percy supported Richard le Scrope, archbishop of York, in another rebellion, and then Percy fled to Scotland, and his estates were confiscated by the king. In 1408 Percy invaded England and was killed at the Battle of Branham Moor.<br>

Ebles II DE POITIERS
<p>
<a name ="I004820"><b>[I004820]</b></a><br />
From Wikipedia<br>
<br>
Ebalus of Aquitaine or Ebles Manzer (ca.870-935) was Count of Poitiers between 901 and 935 and two times Duke of Aquitaine, first between 890 and 893, second from 927 to his death. In the interval, Aquitaine was ruled by Dukes of the house of Auvergne.<br>
<br>
Ebles was an illegitimate son of Ranulf II of Poitiers by, possibly, a Jewish woman. Mamzer is a Hebrew word meaning "bastard". He married an Emiliene and by her had two sons, Ebalus (Ebles) bishop of Limoges, and William III of Aquitaine.<br>
<br>
Ebles was established as Comté de Poitiers in 892 by his father Ranulf II, in the presence of Aymar of Poitiers, and supported by Eudes I of France. Ebles gained the favor of William I the Pious, Count of Auvergne, who placed Aquitaine under his authority.<br>
<br>
In 902, Ebles launched the conquest of his county with an army lent by his distant relative William the Pious. He took Poitiers in the absence of Aymar and established control of the county. He was investitured as Comté de Poitou by Charles the Simple, with whom Ebles was raised.<br>
<br>
Comté de Poitou was the only title in which he ever had legitimate investiture. Ebles alloted the Abbey of Saint-Maixent to Viscomte Savary de Thouars who had been his constant supporter. He restructured Poitiers by creating new vicomtés in Aulnay and Melle and dissolved the title and position of Viscomte de Poitou upon the death of its holder, Maingaud, in 925.<br>
<br>
In 904 he conquered the Limousin. In 911 Ebles was in Chartres with an army that opposed Rollon.<br>
<br>
In 927, William the Younger, heir to William the Pious, and then his successor, his brother Alfred, died in the space of one year. Alfred, having made Ebles his heir, Ebles thus found himself Duke of Aquitaine, Comté du Berry, d'Auvergne and du Velay.<br>
<br>
In 929, King Raoul started trying to reduce the power of Ebles Manzer. He withdrew from him access to Berry, then in 932 he transfered the titles of Duc d'Aquitaine and Comté d'Auvergne to the Count of Toulouse Raymond III Pons. Moreover the territory of March which was under the control of the Seigneur de Charroux, vassal of Ebles, was transformed into an independent county.<br>
