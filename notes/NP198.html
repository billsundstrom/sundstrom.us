 Margaret Joan (Gelder) SUNDSTROM<br>
It is with profound sadness that we announce the sudden death of Margaret Joan Sundstrom (nee Gelder) on Wednesday, April 16, 2014, as a result of a fall while en route to Victoria, BC. Margaret was born on October 28, 1928 in Dodsland, Saskatchewan and spent most of her early years in Smiley, Saskatchewan. She was loved by her husband of 63 years, Glenn Sundstrom and four children, Eric (Nonie), Gail Niinimaa (Veli), Kathi, and Barb English (Scott). Margaret was a proud grandmother to Ari (Carmen), Nils, Lisa (Samantha), Sara, Meika, and Tori, and great-grandmother to Isaac, Kirstin and Maya. Our family always appreciated and treasured Margaret's unconditional love, support and mentorship. Margaret was a caring, compassionate and non-judgmental person. She was a true and loyal friend to many and accepting of all. She could lift a friend's spirits with the delivery of her hand-made cards or delicious apple pie, and received ongoing appreciation for her monthly supply of her trade-mark rolls and cinnamon buns to Inn From the Cold at the Temple B'nai Tikvah. Margaret was a talented artist, creating highly accomplished works using a variety of media. She was a prolific potter in porcelain and raku for over 45 years and was immensely gratified to be able to continue creating and showing her work well into her eighties. Margaret was past president of the Alberta Potters Association and co-curator of the Canmore Artist Guild's "Off the Wall" Show. She was also a longtime volunteer and past chairperson of the Calgary Allied Arts Foundation (CAAF). Margaret, drawing on her prairie background, was a master gardener and shared her knowledge of plants readily with others. By mid-July, her perennial bed was always in full glory and she took humble pleasure in hosting family and friends with home-cooked meals in her beautiful urban oasis. She will be deeply missed. A celebration of her life will be held at Hillhurst United Church, 1227 Kensington Close N.W., on Monday, April 21 at 2:00 p.m. In lieu of flowers, donations may be made in Margaret's name to Inn From the Cold or Decidedly Jazz Danceworks.<br>
