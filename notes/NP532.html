<p>
<a name ="I062107"><b>[I062107]</b></a><br />
 On 1 March 1850. (letter) dated 11 April 1850 Phillip Morris to Charles Morris: <br>
"Jeremiah Swails has gone to California to dig gold he started about the first of March. I was at ? Hills on or about the middle of March and he started for California the day I went there. I did not see him but his folks were well, they told me you had written to him requesting him to look for Johns furnature, but had no time . I did not see the letter yet, I was glad to hear from you and very glad to hear that Lucindas health was improving . We went out to see them last fall shortly after they left and was sorrowfully disappointed we did not hear that they was gone untill we got to Tullers. I would have been glad to have seen Jonathan , but I suppose it was not consistent for him to come and see me, therefore I excuse him."<br>

SOUTHPORT - Cellen S. Fowle passed away at her home in Southport on Monday Jan. 23, 2017, after nearly 89 years with us. She was married to Evert N. Fowle for nearly 60 years, who predeceased her in 2009. <br>
She was the mother of Cellen A. Fowle of Palisades, NY, John Fowle of Tappan, NY, Evert N. Fowle of Vassalboro and Dr. Janet Fowle of Damariscotta. She also leaves 10 grandchildren, Sarah, Benjamin, John Ross, Johanna, Allison, Evert, Hayden, Morgan, Max, and Cole.<br>
She lived in Lexington, Mass. for more than 40 years and raised our family. She was active in town affairs and taught school for many years. She wrote glorious stories about the children of Winthrop Road, and like many mothers of that time, in concert with the other moms, kept a close eye on them, while allowing them to be kids. All of her children feel blessed and fortunate to have had such a loving and nurturing mother, and our parent's love for each other set the best example and provided reassurance to us. <br>
Later she sailed to Europe, Asia Minor, and the Caribbean with her husband, family and friends. Until the very end, she was an inspiration to us, and would not allow us to worry about her. We will miss her very much.<br>
A memorial service will be held in the spring.<br>

Jean SWAN
<p>
<a name ="I029871"><b>[I029871]</b></a><br />
Jean Swan Gordon died on April 26, 2013 at her home in Old Lyme, Conn., at the age of 91.She was born on February 22, 1922, in Brooklyn, N.Y., the oldest of four children, to John and Helen Ross Swan. After a brief time in Fall River, Mass., the family moved to Norfolk, Va., where her father ran the Norfolk branch of William H. Swan and Sons, a ship chandlery and former ship building company, founded by her great-grandfather. She graduated from Smith College in 1942.<br>
On December 2, 1943 she married Navy Lieutenant Robert C. Gordon while he was home on "survivorʼs leave" from the South Pacific, where his ship had been sunk by Japanese torpedoes. December of this year would have been their 70th anniversary.<br>
The couple had three children, John, Craigie and Alan. They lived in Cambridge, Mass.; Eugene, Ore.; Edinburgh, Scotland; and Los Gatos, Calif. On her husbandʼs retirement from teaching, they came back east and settled in Old Lyme, Conn., spending summers on the Mill Pond in East Boothbay in a home near those where her Maine ancestors, of which she was inordinately proud, had once lived. There are three Gordon grandchildren, Jonathan, Ashley and Sasha (Alexandra), and one great-grandchild, Laurel.<br>
Jean Gordon was an artist. She was a child prodigy who, when circumstances allowed, never stopped painting. As a teenager she came to Old Lyme to study with Winfield Scott Clime and to North Truro, Cape Cod, Massachusetts to study with Jerry Farnsworth.<br>
Over the decades her art work went through several phases, beginning with portraits, finally reaching what in retrospect seemed the inevitable fusion of her love of line and color with her love of gardening.<br>
The paintings for which she is most remembered, popular enough to have inspired at least one plagiarist, were of garden and wild flowers in glass vessels, displaying both petals and stems, the blossoming with the withering.<br>
They have been called "anti-bouquets - informal, energetic, and attentive to every feeding and winding tendril, as well as the various stages of growth and decay." Many are now held by private collectors and institution's collections.<br>
Jean Gordon was predeceased by her daughter, Craigie Gordon, and is survived by her husband, one sister, two sons, three grandchildren, one great-grandchild - and much beauty which, without her, would not have come to be.<br>
Donations in Jeanʼs name should be made to the Tree of Life Educational Foundation or The Crosby Fund for Haitian Education or the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence.<br>
A memorial service will be held Saturday, May 11 at 3 p.m. in the First Congregational Church of Old Lyme, the church long attended by Jean and her husband.<br>

Erik VI Bjornsson of SWEDEN
<p>
<a name ="I005547"><b>[I005547]</b></a><br />
From Wikipedia<br>
<br>
Eric the Victorious (VI), Old Norse: Eirı́kr inn sigrsæli, Modern Swedish: Erik Segersäll, (970?- 995), was king of the Swedes during the second half of the 10th century.<br>
<br>
The extent of his kingdom is disputed. In addition to the Swedish heartland round lake Mälaren it may have extended down the Baltic Sea coast as far south as Blekinge.<br>
<br>
The Norse sagas relate that he was the son of Björn Eriksson and that he ruled together with his brother Olof Björnsson. He married Sigrid the Haughty, the daughter of the legendary Viking Skagul Toste, but would later divorce her and give her Götaland as a fief. Before this happened, his brother Olof died, and a new co-ruler had to be appointed. The Swedes refused to accept his rowdy nephew Styrbjörn Starke as his co-ruler and the controversy was settled when Eric suggested that the new co-ruler would be his and Sigrid's unborn child, on condition that it was a son. Styrbjörn was given 60 longships by Eric and sailed away to live as a Viking. Styrbjörn would become the ruler of Jomsborg and an ally and brother-in-law of the Danish king Harold Bluetooth. Styrbjörn returned to Sweden with a major Danish army, which Eric defeated on the Fyris Wolds at Old Uppsala.<br>
<br>
According to Adam of Bremen, Eric would conquer Denmark and chase away its king Sweyn Forkbeard and proclaimed himself the king of Sweden and Denmark which he ruled until his death which would have taken place in 994 or 995. He is said to have been baptised in Denmark, but later returned to the Norse gods.<br>
<br>
In all probability he founded the town of Sigtuna, which still exists and where the first Swedish coins were stamped for his son and successor Olof Skötkonung.<br>
<br>
However, Adam of Bremen only gives Emund Eriksson as predecessor to Eric the Victorious, but it is possible that Emund and Björn were co-rulers, like Erik and Olof and their semi-legendary ancestors Björn at Hauge and Anund Uppsale.<br>
</p>
Olaf III Eriksson of SWEDEN
<p>
<a name ="I005545"><b>[I005545]</b></a><br />
Olaf was the first King of Sweden to become Christian.<br>
<br>
From Wikipedia<br>
<br>
Olof of Sweden or Olof Skötkonung/Skottkonung (the meaning of the cognomen is disputed) was the son of Eric the Victorious and Sigrid the Haughty. He was probably born in the latter part of the 960s and he succeeded his father ca 994. Our knowledge of Olof is mostly based on Snorri Sturluson's accounts, which have been subject to criticism from source-critical scholars.<br>
<br>
According to the Sagas, his father Eric the Victorious ruled together with Eric's brother Olof Björnsson. When Olof Björnsson died, Olof was proclaimed co-ruler instead of his cousin Styrbjörn Starke. This happened before he even was born. At his father's death, he inherited the throne of Sweden and became its sole ruler.<br>
<br>
In a Viking expedition to Wendland, he had captured Edla, the daughter of a Wendish chieftain, and she gave him the son Emund (who was to become king of Sweden), and the daughter Astrid. He later married Estrid, a christian girl and she bore him the son Anund Jacob and the daughter Ingegerd Olofsdotter.<br>
<br>
Olof is said to have preferred royal sports to war and therefore, Sweyn Forkbeard retook Denmark, which Olof's father Eric had conquered. Olof also lost the right to tribute which his predecessors long had preserved in the Baltic States.<br>
<br>
In 1000, he allied with Sweyn Forkbeard, who was married to Olof's mother, and with the Norwegian Jarls Eric and Sven, against the Norwegian ing Olaf Tryggvason. Olaf Tryggvason died in the Battle of Svolder and Olof gained a part of Trøndelag as well as modern Bohuslän<br>
<br>
When the Norwegian kingdom was reestablished by Olaf II of Norway, a new war errupted between Norway and Sweden. Many men in both Sweden and Norway tried to reconcile the kings. In 1018, the earl of Westrogothia, Ragnvald Ulfsson and the Norwegian king's emissaries Björn Stallare and Halte Skeggesson had arrived at the thing of Uppsala to sway the Swedish king to accept peace and as a warrant marry his daughter Ingegerd Olofsdotter to the king of Norway. The Swedish king was greatly angered and threatened to banish Ragnvald from his kingdom, but Ragnvald was supported by his foster-father Thorgny Lawspeaker, who was the wisest and most respected man in Sweden.<br>
<br>
Thorgny rose and held a powerful speech where he reminded the king of the great Viking expeditions in the East that predecessors such as Erik Eymundsson and Björn had undertaken, without having the hubris not to listen to his men's advice. Torgny, himself, had taken part in many sucessful pillaging expeditions with Olof's father Eric the Victorious and even Eric had listened to his men. The present king wanted nothing but Norway, which no Swedish king before him had desired. This displeased the Swedish people, who was eager to follow the king on new ventures in the East to win back the kingdoms that payed tribute to his ancestors, but it was the wish of the people that the king make peace with the king of Norway and give him his daughter Ingegerd as queen.<br>
<br>
Thorgny finished his speech by saying: if you do not desire to do so, we shall assault you and kill you and not brook anymore of your warmongering and obstinacy. Our ancestors have done so, who at Mula thing threw five kings in a well, kings who were too arrogant as you are against us.<br>
<br>
These arguments convinced Olof to follow his people's advice. However, Olof showed no signs of wanting to keep his promise, but married his daughter to Yaroslav I the Wise instead, and then the Swedes became restless. However, the impending rebellion was settled when Olof accepted to share his power with his son Anund Jacob. Olof was also made to accept a settlement with Olaf II of Norway at Kungahälla, who already had been married (unbeknownst to Olof) with Olof's daugher, Astrid, through the Geatish jarl Ragnvald Ulfsson.<br>
<br>
Olof was baptised, probably by the missionary Sigfrid the Holy, ca 1000, and he was the first Swedish king to remain christian until his death. However, according to Adam of Bremen, the fact that the vast majority of the Swedes were still pagan, forced him to limit the christian activities to the already christian border province of Westrogothia.<br>
<br>
His death is said to have taken place, in the winter of 1020-1021.<br>
<br>
Since the 1740s, it has been claimed that he was buried in Husaby in the christian part of his kingdom, but it should be noted that such identifications are speculation, and by no means uncontroversial.<br>

OBITUARY:<br>

A proud veteran of the Korean War, he served in the U.S. Army as a Staff Sergeant with the 27th Infantry Division Fox Company stationed in Korea. When he was asked to attend intelligence school during his period of service, he chose instead to return to the trenches with his fellow soldiers.<br>
Appointed by Mayor William Shaughnessy to the Woburn Police Department as a permanent officer in 1959, he made Sergeant in 1966 and Lieutenant in 1969. He moved up the ranks to the position of Captain in 1980. Dave was an extremely intelligent man with a razor-sharp memory who scored a rare 100% on a police exam. He was well respected by his fellow officers, and he was a strong leader who took the time to mentor younger members of the department. He retired in 1997. Captain Sweeney held membership in the Woburn Police Relief Association, and was a member of the Superior Officers Local 528 International Brotherhood of Police Officers.<br>

He was a great lover of poetry and would often recite poems in their entirety by memory. He was extremely well versed in conservative politics and enjoyed debating others with opposing views. <br>
Dave most enjoyed spending time at home with his family. He was a talented cook and an avid gardener who took pleasure in tending to his flowers and his yard. In 1994, his beloved son Jamie was involved in an automobile accident that left him severely brain injured. He devoted his retirement years to Jamie, ensuring that he received the care and treatment he needed.<br>
He and his wife Adeline enjoyed many wonderful trips during their marriage. They traveled to Bermuda, Italy and Ireland, and spent time every summer on Cape Cod. Several visits were made to the British Virgin Islands with his family and for their fiftieth anniversary, Dave, Adeline and their daughters celebrated in Antigua. During his battle with cancer, Dave still managed to travel with his family to Kennebunkport and Martha's Vineyard and spent many special times at his daughter's home on Lake Winnipesauke in New Hampshire. He especially delighted in time spent with his grandchildren, who lovingly called him "Pops."<br>
He was a familiar figure at the 8 o'clock mass at St. Charles Church on Sunday mornings where he served as an usher. He had a quiet faith that sustained him throughout his life. During his battle with cancer, he remained stoic and uncomplaining, concerned only with the well-being of his loved ones. <br>
