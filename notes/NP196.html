After high school he attended Fresno State and the University of Montana, where he studied Art. He admired artists, illustrators and cartoonists alike, and his artistic talent and keen eye for beauty, later inspired his unique hand-routed wood signs that are a trademark of the Stehekin Valley and miles of surrounding back country trails. In 1958, Phil joined the Merchant Marines as an Ordinary Seaman. He had the privilege of being a crew member on the maiden voyage of the hospital ship Hope. In 1960, Phil joined the Army and served in the 101st Airborne Division as a Paratrooper.

Phil was also a Farrier and shod horses for local horse owners and outfitters, as well as the Park Service. Phil met and married his wife, Wendy, a nurse, in 1967, while both worked in Yosemite. Phil and Wendy lived at the historic Buckner Apple Orchard for over 30 years. Phil took care of the trees and buildings, welcomed frequent visitors and kept the character of the place alive. In 2008, Phil and Wendy took a long-anticipated journey to Norway, to explore his family heritage and returned with pictures and tales to share with friends and family. <br>

<p>
<a name ="I041738"><b>[I041738]</b></a><br />
Pro Rodeo Hall of Fame<br>
Bareback Riding - Inducted 1998<br>
Marvin Garrett told his fourth grade teacher he wanted to be a cowboy when he grew up. To prove it, he began riding steers when he was 12. However, his mother altered the course of history when she said he couldnʼt be a bull rider (at age 15) until he could sign his own association permit, but he could ride bareback. "The first one I got on, I knew I was going to do that, and I forgot all about bull riding," said Garrett, who went on to win four world titles. Rodeo could have lost its champion completely to wrestling. Garrett was all-state and All-American in 1982 and received wrestling scholarship offers from Iowa and North Dakota. North Dakota and Wyoming also offered rodeo scholarships. Garrett, born July 28, 1963, in Belle Fourche, S.D., was named Rookie of the Year in 1986. His 1988 NFR appearance earned him his nickname, "Marvelous Marvin."  Four times he has been the associationʼs regular season money leader in bareback riding. This million-dollar cowboy has won championships at Houston, San Antonio, the Cow Palace, Pendleton (Ore.) and most everywhere in between. "When I am done, I want to be able to look back and say Iʼve done all I can do to make the sport better. I hope I can do that."  Garrett recorded his first 90-point ride over the Fourth of July 2004 on Powder Riverʼs Khadafy Skoal.<br>

William GASCOIGNE
<p>
<a name ="I008226"><b>[I008226]</b></a><br />
From Wikipedia<br>
<br>
Sir William Gascoigne (c. 1350-1419) was Chief Justice of England during the reign of King Henry IV. His reputation is that of a great lawyer who in times of doubt and danger asserted the principle that the head of state is subject to law, and that the traditional practice of public officers, or the expressed voice of the nation in parliament, and not the will of the monarch or any part of the legislature, must guide the tribunals of the country.<br>
<br>
He was a descendant of an ancient Yorkshire family. The date of his birth is uncertain, but it appears from the year-books that he practised as an advocate in the reigns of Edward III and Richard II. When Henry of Lancaster was banished by Richard II, Gascoigne was appointed one of his attorneys, and soon after Henry's accession to the throne was made chief justice of the court of King's Bench. After the suppression of the rising in the north in 1405, Henry eagerly pressed the chief justice to pronounce sentence upon Lord Scrope, the Archbishop of York, and the Earl Marshal Thomas Mowbray, who had been implicated in the revolt. This he absolutely refused to do, asserting the right of the prisoners to be tried by their peers. Although both were later executed, the chief justice had no part in this. It has been doubted whether Gascoigne could have displayed such independence of action without prompt punishment or removal from office.<br>
<br>
The popular tale of his committing the Prince of Wales (the future Henry V) to prison must also be regarded as unauthentic, though it is both picturesque and characteristic. It is said that the judge had directed the punishment of one of the prince's riotous companions, and the prince, who was present and enraged at the sentence, struck or grossly insulted the judge. Gascoigne immediately committed him to prison, and gave the prince a dressing-down that caused him to acknowledge the justice of the sentence. The king is said to have approved of the act, but it appears that Gascoigne was removed from his post or resigned soon after the accession of Henry V. He died in 1419, and was buried in the parish church of Harewood in Yorkshire. Some biographies of the judge have stated that he died in 1412, but this is disproved by Edward Foss in his Lives of the Judges; and although it is clear that Gascoigne did not hold office long under Henry V, it is not impossible that the scene in the fifth act of the second part of Shakespeare's Henry V has some historical basis, and that the judge's resignation was voluntary.<br>
