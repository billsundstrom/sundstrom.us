<h2>Notes</h2>
Henry Griffin CURTIS
<p>
<a name ="I028980"><b>[I028980]</b></a><br />
The source Searsport Sea Captains verifies that Henry was a ship captain who sailed from Searsport (Waldo County) Maine. According to that source, he sailed on the following vessels: the ship Hope (1879-82), sold in Honolulu prior to December 22, 1882; the ship John C. Potter (1883-87; the ship Belle of Bath (1888); and the ship State of Maine (1890-93, 1894-99).<br>
<br>
In August, 1882, Capt. Curtis left Puget Sound in the ship Hope with a cargo of lumber for Valparaiso. On September 12, when in Lat. 18 N., the ship was practically dismasted losing fore and main masts with everything attached. The ship made no water and Capt. Curtis set up a jury rig. One month after the disaster he reached Honolulu, having sailed 2,100 miles. He returned to San Francisco after selling the Hope for the owners. Upon retiring from the sea, he spent two years in the stevedore business, after which he returned to Searsport because of ill health and spent the remainder of his life there.<br>

Gruffudd ap CYNAN
<p>
<a name ="I004644"><b>[I004644]</b></a><br />
Gruffydd ap Cynan (c. 1055-1137) was a Prince of Gwynedd.<br>
<br>
Much of the information about Gruffydd's life comes from a tract of disputed authority: The Life of Gruffydd ap Cynan. According to this text, Gruffydd was born near Swords, County Dublin in Ireland. He was the son of a Welsh Prince, Cynan ap Iago, who was a claimant to the Kingship of Gwynedd but was probably never king of Gwynedd. His mother was a member of the Hiberno-Norse dynasty that ruled Dublin. Through his mother, Grruffydd claimed relationships with many of the leading spets in Ireland, including those of the Ua Briain.<br>
<br>
During his many struggles to gain the kingship of Gwyneed, Gruffydd received considerable aid from Ireland, both from the Hiberno-Norse at Dublin, but also those at Wexford, and also from Muirchertach Ua Briain.<br>
<br>
During his lengthy reign, considered to be a "Golden Age" for Wales, he retook much of Gwynedd from its English conquerors. He was succeeded by his son Owain Gwynedd.<br>
