Son of Richard Fitz Gilbert de Clare and Alice de Gernon. Succeeded to the earldom when his brother Gilbert died without issue. In 1164 he assisted with the Constitutions of Clarendon.

William DE CLINTON
<p>
<a name ="I014854"><b>[I014854]</b></a><br />
The following puts this lineage into question.<br>
<br>
From Wikipedia<br>
<br>
William de Clinton, 1st Earl of Huntingdon and Lord High Admiral, was the younger son of Baron Clinton of Marstock. The Clinton's were a great Norman family who had arrived with William the Conqueror in 1066. The surname Clinton came from the lordship of Clinton in Oxfordshire, given to them at the Conquest. Geoffrey de Clinton was Lord Chamberlain and Treasurer of Henry I, while Roger de Clinton was Bishop of Coventry 1127-1148.<br>
<br>
William de Clinton was born in 1304, and a boyhood companion of Edward III. William was one of the followers of Edward III who secretly entered Nottingham Castle and captured Roger Mortimer, Earl of March. The arrest and subsequent execution of Mortimer cleared the way for the adolescent Edward III to assume power. In 1333, Edward III created William de Clinton earl of Huntingdon. William de Clinton died childless.<br>

From th at date in constant attendance on the king, perhaps a royal secretary. In 1171 accompanied t he king in his campaign in Ireland. Appears holding land in Devon for the first time 1175-11 76. In the king's train on his travels in England and France.<br>

Herbastus DE CREPON
<p>
<a name ="I007716"><b>[I007716]</b></a><br />
Robert de Torigny and the family of Gunnor, Duchess of Normandy by Todd A. Farmerie (modified from article that appeared in Dec 1996 on soc.genealogy.medieval<br>
<br>
"There is much confusion about this, mostly because people did not understand the original source material or never consulted it directly, basing their account on a previous author, who had confused it himself.<br>
<br>
Gunnor had four known siblings - Arfast/Herfast, father of Osbern, guardian of William the Conqueror; Senfria/Sainsfrida, wife of the forester of St. Vaast d'Equiqueville; Wevia, wife of Osbert de Bolbec and mother of the "first" Walter Giffard; and Duvelina, wife of Turulf de Pont Audemer, and ancestor of the Beaumont family. She also had a long list of nieces. For the majority of these, we do not know for certain which of Gunnor's siblings was their parent, because the original source for Gunnor's family, Robert de Torigny, does not say. There is one exception, and that is Joscelina, mother of Roger de Moontgomery.<br>
<br>
With Joscelina, the original document states only that "Roger was the son of one of Countess Gunnor's nieces and therefore held immense possessions in different parts of Normandy." However, in the author's own copy, he has added that this was "Joscelina, daughter of Wevia". In the same paragraph, the author states that Roger was son of Hugh de Montgomery. This results in a pedigree in which Roger is son of Hugh by Joscelina, daughter of Wevia.<br>
<br>
This solution is in conflict with two other sources. One is a genealogy prepared in the 1110s by Bishop Ivo of Chartres. He was addressing the proposed marriage of a daughter of Roger de Montgomey to an illegitimate son of Henry I of England. He was documenting the fact that the two were too closely related to be allowed to marry. He shows that Roger de<br>
Montgomery was son of "Joscelina, daughter of Seufria" rather than daughter of Wevia. Given these two conflicting sources, we can only go on indirect evidence. Most important is the fact that Roger, through his link with Gunnor's niece, held immense possessions throughout Normandy. This would be more likely if Joscelina was a (co-)heiress of her parents, rather than being a daughter in a family where the majority of the property went to sons. Thus Senfria is the more likely parent, since Wevia had two sons, who would have gotten the bulk of her land.<br>
<br>
The other conflict comes from a charter recorded at the monastery at Thorn, in which Roger was recorded as son of another Roger. Thus Robert de Torigny must be wrong in calling Roger son of Hugh. Some have 'solved' this problem by displacing Hugh with an earlier Roger, and making him the husband of Joscelina, but this breaks the linkage of Joscelina and Hugh suggested by Robert. An alternative now seems the prefered solution. In at least two other places, the author appears to have compacted two generations with the same name into one, so perhaps he has done it here, and that Roger was son of Roger, who in turn was son of Hugh and Joscelina. This solution is prefered chronologically, since Roger was a contemporary of William the Conqueror, and yet without the forgotten generatin, would be expected to have been much older.<br>
<br>
Thus current thinking is that Roger de Montgomery (husband of Mabel de Belleme) was son of Roger, son of Hugh and Joscelina, daughter of Senfria, sister of Gunnor. " Todd A. Farmerie in an email response to questions about article<br>

Herfast DE CREPON
<p>
<a name ="I015396"><b>[I015396]</b></a><br />
The only known brother of Gunnor was Arfast/Herfast, of whom we gain what little insight we have from a trial of heretics conducted by King Robert II of France. Arfast testified that he had pretended to join the sect, all the better to denounce them when the time arose. he later donated lands to the monastery of St. Pere, to which he retired. He had at least two sons.<br>
<br>
During the famous trial of Herefast de Crepon (who was alleged to be involved with the Cathars) in 1022, the crowd outside the church in Orleans became so unruly that, according to Moore:<br>
    "At the king's command, Queen Constance stood before the doors of the Church, to prevent the common people from killing them inside the Church, and they were expelled from the bosom of the Church. As they were being driven out, the queen struck out the eye of Stephen, who had once been her confessor, with the staff which she carried in her hand."<br>

Herleva DE FALAISE
<p>
<a name ="I008015"><b>[I008015]</b></a><br />
From Wikipedia<br>
<br>
Herleva (or Arlette) was the mother of William the Conqueror.<br>
<br>
Little is known for certain about Herleva's background, or the circumstances of William's birth. The written evidence dates from a generation or two later, and is not entirely consistent. Probably she was the teenage daughter of a tanner named Fulbert from the small Norman town of Falaise, where they lived. Translation being somewhat uncertain, Fulbert may instead have been a furrier, embalmer, or a person who laid out corpses for burial.<br>
<br>
Legend has is that it all started when Robert, the young Duke of Normandy saw Herleva washing in the river near his castle. He was unable to resist her and took her for his mistress. She later gave birth to his son, William in 1027 or 1028.<br>
<br>
Their love affair didn't last. While Robert went on a pilgrimage, Herleva married Herluin de Conteville in 1029. From this marriage she had two sons: Odo and Robert, who both became prominent during William's reign. They also had at least one daughter, who married William, lord of La Ferté-Macé.<br>
<br>
William the Conqueror had a (half or full) sister, Adelaide, who may have been Herleva's daughter, but could possibly have been a daughter of Robert by some other mistress. Adelaide married first Enguerrand, count of Ponthieu, second Lambert of Lens, and third Odo, count of Champagne.<br>
<br>
Herleva probably died around 1050.<br>
