SMITH, (Tupper), Ruth Rena -79, Dutch Settlement, it is with great sadness that we announce Ruth's passing on February 16, 2013, in Musquodoboit Valley Memorial Hospital, after a long battle with cancer. Special thanks to all the nurses at the palliative care unit, VON and homecare who came in to the house. Born October 25, 1933, Preaux, Kings C., she was the daughter of the late Robie and Rena May (Munroe) Tupper. Ruth was employed as a cook with Cara Operations, Beaver Foods and Dutch Lunch Restaurant. Laughter made up a large part of Ruth's life. She would always wait to hear Joey's next joke. In the early years the family would spend many weekends camping with good friends. Laughter could be heard all around the campground from pranks and jokes being told. Gardening was another passion of Ruth's. Ike and Ruth spent many hours working on the vegetable garden and beautiful flower beds. Her reputation as a fine cook was well known. Family and friends would love to be invited for a meal, but unexpected guests were always welcome and she had no trouble to quickly put a meal together. Ruth was a member of Rebekah Lodge and Gays River United Church. Although she left Scott's Bay to make Dutch Settlement her home her thoughts were never far from the bay. Ruth is survived by her children, Eric (Lynne), Gays River; Harlen "Joey" (Michelle), Elmsdale; Tommy (Gwen) Campbell, Dutch Settlement; (who was like a son to her), grandchildren Amanda Smith, Skye (Nathan Dixon) Lepage, Charissa Lepage; three great-grandchildren; brothers Alton (Ruby) Tupper, Enfield; Donnie (Mary Lou) Tupper, Scott's Bay; Calvin Tupper, Alberta; several nieces and nephews. Besides her parents she was predeceased by her husband Max "Ike", brothers Frank, Harley and Orlie. Cremation has taken place under the care of Ettinger Funeral Home.

STURK (Tupper), Shirley Elaine - died peacefully on January 20th, 2014, in the Soldierʼs Memorial Hospital, Middleton, encircled by her loving family. Born in Morristown, Kings Co., on December 2, 1930, she was the daughter of Durward and Helen (Haines) Tupper. Shirley was well-known for her resourcefulness and high energy. She worked steadfastly on the family mixed farm with her husband, Edmund.

She was an active life-long member of the Morristown Baptist Church. Her church activities included being a church deacon, member of the Womenʼs Missionary Society, Superintendent of the Sunday school and teaching Sunday school classes for countless years. Through the years Shirley played hostess to hundreds of Farm & Country Vacationers and B&B guests as well as numerous boarders. She was a good cook and was well known for her ability to feed a crowd. No one ever went away hungry from Shirleyʼs table and she never showed up empty-handed at someoneʼs door. She was an active member of the Morristown Mountain Peakers Seniors Club and could often be found organizing parties for local seniors. Shirley enjoyed off-colour jokes and telling stories and was never shy to stand up and speak at any function. She loved music and even in her 80s was kicking up her heels on the dance floor. Shirley loved to travel and went on many extensive trips in recent years including a family Alaskan cruise, a girls trip with her daughters to Turkey, a Danube river cruise in April and a month-long bus trip to California in September.

Thomas TUPPER
<p>
<a name ="I005725"><b>[I005725]</b></a><br />
Thomas Henry Tupper, b. 16 January 1637/38 at Sandwich, MA. If the birthdates are correct, his mother was about 49 or 50 when she had Thomas. He married Martha Mayhew on 27 December 1661 (see a separate chapter on her family). Martha was born in 1638 at Watertown, MA. They had 11 children (see next section). Thomas died 26 April 1706, still at Sandwich and his widow on 15 November 1717 (on January 15 1716/17 according to (16)) at Sandwich. Citing (12) and (13), (10) provides the following text on Thomas:<br>
<br>
Like his father, Thomas Tupper, Jr. was a missionary to the American Indians and served the Church at Herring Pond, 1676-1706. He was a member of the Council of War, town clerk, Selectman for 14 years, Deputy to the General Court 8 years, and is buried under a stone standing by the pond in the old burying ground at Sandwich, Mass. With his father, he is listed as one of the largest landowners in the town. He was Lt. of the military company at Sandwich in 1680, and became Capt. in 1690.<br>
</p>
Thomas TUPPER
<p>
<a name ="I005727"><b>[I005727]</b></a><br />
THOMAS TUPPER, son of Henry Tupper and grandson of Richard Tupper of co. Sussex, England, was born in Bury, co. Sussex, 28 Jan. 1578. As a ship's carpenter and member of the crew, he is believed to have voyaged to America first about 1621, again in 1624, when he remained a year, a third time in 1631 when he stayed at Cape Ann for an uncertain period, finally coming to Sandwich, Mass., in 1637 where he settled and remained until his death 28 March 1676. Thomas Tupper married first in the Parish of Chelmsford, co. Essex, 29 April 1622, Katharine Gator; secondly, in Topsfield, Mass., 25 Jan. 1628, Susan Turner, a widow, who died in Topsfield in 1634; and thirdly, in Ipswich, Mass., 21 Dec. 1634, Anne Hodgson, a widow, of Topsfield, who was born about 1588 and died in Sandwich 4 June 1676.<br>
Thomas Tupper who had come to Sandwich in 1637 with his daughter aged twelve and a two year old son, became an outstanding citizen of the community and developed exceptional ability. He served in the general court in 1644 and later was deputy for 20 years, from 1647 to 1667; he served on juries, local boards and commissions, was a charter member of the church and for three years from 1667 was selectman of the town. In his later years, when there was no settled minister, Mr. Tupper conducted religious services as a layman and he was deeply interested in religious work among the Indians. He was shrewd trader and invested heavily in real estate and held large holdings at his death.<br>

<br>
<br>
Thomas, b. in Bury, Sussex County on 28 (7) January 1578. Birth date 27 January 1577/78 (16). As a ship's carpenter and member of the crew, he is believed to have voyaged to America first about 1621, again in 1624 when he remained a year, a third time in 1631 when he stayed at Cape Ann for an uncertain period, and finally to Sandwich, Mass. in 1637 where he settled and remained until his death 28 March 1676 (1678 according to (16)). This sequence is from (3) but it does not seem entirely correct: note that he married in January 1627/28 in MA and his wife died in Topsfield, MA in 1634. According to (2), about 1635 he emigrated to Massachusetts to obtain "liberty of conscience", denied to him under the reign of Charles I of England. This seems however like a bit of an embellishment since we know he first came to America as a hired tradesman.<br>
<br>
Thomas Tupper married first in the Parish of Chelmsford, Essex, 29 April 1622, to Katharine Gator. They had two children, both born in England. It is not clear if his wife ever came to America. Secondly, he was married, in Topsfield, Mass., 25 January 1627/28, to Susan Turner, a widow. Thomas and Susan had two children, both born in England (1628 and 1633), so at least Susan must have returned to England. She must have later returned to the New World because she died in Topsfield in 1634. Thirdly, in Ipswich, Mass., 21 December 1634, Thomas married Anne Hodgson (Thomas would have been about 56). Anne was a widow, of Topsfield, born about 1588 (between 1588 and 1598 in (16) and written "Hodgeson") and who died in Sandwich 4 June 1676. They had one child. If the birthdates are correct, Anne would have been about 49 or 50 when she had her son Thomas; this seems a bit unlikely.<br>
<br>
Thomas was one of the incorporators (2) of the town of Sandwich, MA and became an outstanding citizen of that town. He served in the general court in 1644 and later was deputy for 20 years, from 1647 to 1667; he served on juries, local boards and commissions, was a charter member of the church and for three years starting in 1667 was Selectman of the town (i.e., a member of a board of officers annually elected to manage various local concerns in a New England town). In his later years, when there was no settled minister, Mr. Tupper conducted religious services as a layman and he was deeply interested in religious work among the Indians. The source (2) adds that he cared especially for the Indians who were "living in spiritual darkness and savagery" and that he built the Indians a place of worship and established a congregation at Herring Pond. He was shrewd trader and invested heavily in real estate and held large holdings at his death.<br>
<br>
<br>
My information on the children of Thomas Tupper comes largely from (3) who provides good information on his original sources (which I repeat here). Thomas Tupper and his first wife Katharine [sic] Gator had two children in England:<br>
<br>
1) Katherine Tupper, b. 31 January 1622/1623 in England. She married 19 October 1640 in Sandwich to Benjamin Nye, b. 4 May 1620 (4) at Biddenden, Kent, England, son of Thomas Nye and Agnes Rye. Benjamin had come to America on the Abigail in 1635 with the Freeman company. He first settled in Lynn, MA, but soon thereafter removed to Sandwich, MA. In (2), the ancestry of Benjamin is traced back a further 10 generations through England and back to the early 1300s in Denmark! Katherine died 4 June 1676 at Sandwich. Benjamin and Katherine had eight children:<br>
<br>
Nathan Nye, b. after 1640, d. 1747 at Sandwich (sic from (2), but death date highly unlikely unless he was one of the last children). He was married to Mercy and they had 10 children (see (2) for details).<br>
Mary, b. after 1640, married 1 June 1670 to Jacob Burgess. No further information available.<br>
John, b. 29 June 1650. He m. Esther Shed. No further information available.<br>
Ebenezer, b. after 1640. He was m. 17 December 1675 (4) at Sandwich to Sarah Gibbs, daughter of Thomas Gibbs.<br>
Jonathan, b. 29 November 1649, m. Patience Burgess.<br>
Mercy (5), b. 4 April 1652. She married in January 1678/79 to Matthias Ellis, son of John Ellis and Elizabeth Freeman. They had nine children (see (3) for details and for more information on Matthias Ellis). She died after 13 November 1744.<br>
Caleb, b. after 1640. He m. Elizabeth Atwood. No further information available.<br>
Benjamin, b. after 1640. He d. 26 March 1676, killed by Indians at the Battle of Rehoboth in King Phillip's War.<br>
<br>
2) Robert, b. 1630 in England, died in infancy.<br>
<br>
The two children of Thomas Tupper and Susan Turner were:<br>
<br>
3) Thomas Tupper, b. after 1628 in England. He died in infancy.<br>
4) Robert, b. 3 November 1633 in England. As an infant he must have gone to America with his mother, who died the next year in 1634 in Topsfield. Robert m. 9 May 1654 at Sandwich to Deborah Perry. No further information available.<br>
<br>
Finally, the only child of Thomas Tupper and his third wife Anne Hodgson was:<br>
<br>
5) Thomas Henry Tupper, b. 16 January 1637/38 at Sandwich, MA.<br>

<a name ="I098395"><b>[I098395]</b></a><br />
William Walter Tupper - 1933-2021<br>
A great Nova Scotian and Annapolis Valley elder has passed away. Bill Tupper was a loving husband, a loyal brother, a dedicated father, and a stalwart community member. A long-standing member of Centerville Baptist Church, Bill was a man of unshakeable faith, a beacon and role model to all who knew him.<br>
The son of the late Gertrude Frail and Elmer Tupper of Scots Bay, Bill was born in Canning, and grew up in the community of Scots Bay, where he was as familiar and beloved as Cape Blomidon. His talents were both practical and creative; as a young man he developed valuable skills as a sewing machine technician, eventually becoming well-enough known as an expert repairman and collector that, until his final illness, people brought their sewing machines to him from communities throughout Nova Scotia.<br>
A versatile musician, Bill made his own instruments, became a self-taught guitarist and fiddler in the Maritime tradition, and eventually held the position of Inaugural President and lifetime member of the Kings' Fiddlers. In addition to these uncommon gifts,<br>
Bill was a great storyteller, as well as a repository of local knowledge, and a competent artist who captured many historically-valuable scenes of vanished Valley ways of life in his drawings, paintings, and vibrant rug hookings in the 'Primitive' style. Impressive as these gifts were, it is Bill's generosity, his support for those in need, his talent as a father, and his great heart, that are perhaps best remembered. As an old friend of his once said, "They don't make 'em like that anymore."<br>
Bill is survived by his wife, Olive Goodwin Tupper and her children, Diane, Jeff and Judith, as well as by his daughter, Sheila (partner of Wally, Coldbrook N.S.); sons, Brian (husband of Heather, Rothesay, NB), Robert (husband of Belinda, Scots Bay, NS), Alan (husband of Junie), Gerald Vidito (husband of Darlene, Port George, NS); sister-in-law, Althea (Scots Bay, NS); grandchildren, Ian, Jodi, Chad, Melinda, Robert, Travis, Kristin, Tamara, Connor, Carson, step-grandchildren Zac, Jacob, and Ally; eleven great grandchildren, and his beloved feline companion, Callie.<br>

We are deeply saddened to announce the passing of Nancy Bentley. Nancy passed away unexpectedly on Friday, June 12th.   Born to Mildred and Henry Turcotte on April 16, 1935, Nancy grew up in Saugus, Massachusetts. She graduated from Saugus High School in 1954.   Within days of graduating, she married the love of her life, Oren Bentley Jr, another Saugus native. Their love was truly like no other. They spent 55 years adoring each other until his passing in December of 2009. Together, they raised their four children, and in retirement moved to Alton, New Hampshire. They spent these years tending to their farmhouse and spoiling their grandchildren and great grandchildren. In most recent years, she could be found at the Alton senior center, swimming with her friends at a local pool, or spending time with her family.<br>
Nancy was admired for her kind heart, her cheerful disposition, and her ability to see the best in others. All that knew her were better for it. She had a way of making you feel special, and most of all, loved. Her resilience and strength are traits we all wish to emulate. Her happiness was contagious, and her demeanor always put you at ease. <br>
She was a loving mother first and foremost, and to her children she will be dearly missed. Those who knew her as Nana were especially lucky. To them, she was their biggest fan, and most enthusiastic cheerleader.<br>
Nancy was the beloved mother of Bonny, Oren III, (Buddy), Don, and Nancy.  She was grandmother to Michael, Steven, Erin, Nikki, Kelly, Oren IV, and Allie, and great grandmother to Abby, Ryley, Brenton, Cora and Evan, all of whom will miss her dearly.<br>
At the time of her passing, Nancy was 85 years old. Though no amount of time with her could ever feel like enough, we are comforted in knowing that the years with her were filled with love. We are also comforted in knowing that she is reunited with the love of her life, and in their true fashion, they are together again just a day before what would have been their 66th anniversary<br>
Those lucky enough to know her will understand the depth of this loss, but should also know that she would not want us to be sad. We must simply understand that God has called back one of his kindest angels, and she has returned to her love, Oren.<br>
