Mrs. G. B. Carson Dead<br>
Mrs. G. B. [Adaline] Carson died at the home of her daughter, Mrs. J[ames] L. Raines, in Perry, at 3:50 o'clock Tuesday morning, death being due to Bright's disease. She had been ill about two months, being confined to the bed most of the time. Mrs. Carson was 72 years of age, and after a long, busy and useful life she died as she had lived--honored, trusted and loved. Two daughters, Mrs. J. L. [Fannie] Raines and Miss Mary Carson, of Perry, and a son, Geo. Carson, of Kansas City, were present when the end came. Funeral services were held at the home at 10 o'clock this morning and largely attended. The Rev. D. A. Shutt conducted the services. Interment was made in Oak Ridge cemetery.<br>

Obituary<br>
Jane Adaline Cole was born near Albany, N.Y., Sept. 10, 1836. She died July 6, 1909, aged 72 years, 10 months, 4 days.<br>
In early childhood she, with a younger sister, was left orphans. They were given a good home by a kind family, with whom she lived until the age of 18, when she was married to G.B. Carson of Knoxville, Mo. In 1858 she, with her husband and two children, moved to Oskaloosa, Kan., making their home there until 1865, when they moved to Perry, Kan., and in 1875 to Joplin, Mo. A few years after the death of her husband, which occurred in 1891, she came back to Perry, where she has since made her home with her daughter, Mrs. J. L. Raines. She passed over the River on the morning of July 6, at 4 o'clock.<br>
Her Christian fortitude and patience in bearing her last affliction was sublime, her principle being to save others trouble and care. She was a model of unselfish devotion to her children, four of whom survive here, three having preceded her to the other shore.<br>
She united with the Cumberland Presbyterian church, remaining a faithful member till her death. Her well-worn and marked Bible is a silent testimony of her devotion to her God. Of a very retiring disposition, she was never heard to censure others' shortcomings, but rather to excuse and uplift.<br>
Gentle, patient mother, yours was a triumphant entrance to the "Glory Land," but you have left sad hearts to battle with life on this side; yet yours is the better part and we should not repine, but try to emulate your sweet example.<br>
The service was conducted by Rev. Shutt at the home Thursday at 10 a.m., and the beautiful thoughts conveyed by him were an inspiration and comfort.<br>
The dear body was laid to rest amid beautiful flowers in the Oak Ridge cemetery.<br>
Her sister, Miss Lizzie Irick, and those of her children, Mrs. J.L. Raines, Geo. B. Carson and Mary Carson, were present at the last.<br>
Card of Thanks<br>
May heaven's choicest blessings rest upon the kind friends and neighbors who so unselfishly assisted us, and for their sympathy in the loss of our dear mother.<br>
Mr. J.L. Raines, Geo. B. Carson & Mary Carson<br>
