Larry and the family would like to thank the Pastor Andy Wallman from Wilton for helping us out tremendously over the last few weeks, and providing spiritual and emotional guidance. We would also like to thank Randy Anderson for frequently visiting Larry, and keeping his spirits up. These two individuals have both been a rock for us and have made Larryʼs journey easier for him.<br>

Rosalind Ann MARTIN
<p>
<a name ="I111828"><b>[I111828]</b></a><br />
Rosalind Ann Martin, 47, died on August 18 in Austin, Texas. Rosalind, an accomplished chef and chef-manager, graduated from the Johnson & Wales in Providence, RI in 1989 and until her death worked in a variety of food-focused roles, where she loved creating a kitchen environment that always strived to bring out the best of the culinary creations, as well as best of her co-workers. Her file folder of "recipes to try" was legendary and always growing; no matter of many she created - there could never be enough new tastes to try!<br>
She was a member of the Ledyard High School Class of 1985, received an Associates in Culinary Arts and a Bachelors in Business from Johnson & Wales. She interned at South Seas Resort in Captiva, FL, and began her career at Charlesgate in Providence and at various Providence area restaurants. After her move to Austin she worked for AMD, The Summit, and Waterloo Ice House. She led the kitchen of the first Alamo Draft House Cinema and eventually worked with the group in both Austin and Houston. She joined Cabelaʼs in Kyle and managed food service operations there. She also worked briefly for the Kipp Public Schools and at a private residence hall at the University of Texas.<br>
She is survived by her mother, Pearl S. Martin of Deerfield Beach FL, her father, James H. Martin of Ledyard CT, as well as by her sister Teresa Martin and niece, Allegra Martin, of Eastham MA.<br>
Just out of college, she was an active body-builder and her car featured the license plate FLEX-67. Even after she stopped competing, she enjoyed staying in shape. She made friends in every place she worked and lived. She grappled with the challenges of life with a positive and brave front and would want to be remembered for the good moments and happy times.<br>
She adored her mini doxies, Penny and Kacy, and her cat Simone, and they were her "babies" that she spoiled endlessly. She loved attending the "Weiner Dog" races and "Weiner Dog" festivals in the Austin area each year and would share stories about how much fun and how sweet the breed was.<br>
She also loved music and enjoyed many South by Southwest festivals, sharing photos and videos of her favorite acts with friends and family. She found new artists to enjoy every year.<br>
But mostly, she loved the culinary arts. As a child she was a finicky eater, once asking for a McDonalds hamburger with no hamburger! In high school she stumbled across Julia Childʼs cooking shows and quickly became fascinated with food and its creation. She loved trying to make food as appealing as possible, whether it was being served to residents of a nursing home or guests in a high-end restaurant. The location didnʼt matter: people deserved to enjoy the eating experience wherever they were with whatever capacity they had. Food could be simple, it could be processing childhood snack food, it could take hours to prepare - it didnʼt matter; she loved everything about it.<br>
Her two favorite places in the world were Austin, TX and Provincetown, MA. Celebrations of her life will be held in both locations and a little piece of her will stay in each town, so that she can forever keep an eye out for the best new restaurants and the best new eats, and remain a presence for the people she loved.<br>

Richard Terence MASAMITSU
<p>
<a name ="I002293"><b>[I002293]</b></a><br />
Richard Terence Masamitsu died on November 2, 2020 at the age of 65. Born to Kaino Robert Masamitsu and Joyce Sachiko Masamitsu, née Tsuchida, on February 20, 1955 in Cook County IL, he married his wife, Michelle, on November 14, 1981.<br>
Together, Richard and Michelle built a family, weathered lifeʼs storms, and celebrated almost forty years of committed and wonderful marriage. They had six children, five of whom are living, who all carry their fatherʼs humor, love of music, and faith. They, along with their mother, loved Richard greatly.<br>
Richard was a man of deep faith, and early on served in churches at both Merced and Winters, California. He later worked as an assistant editor in the film/television industry from which he retired. In March, 2020 he and Michelle moved from California to return to the ministry. They moved to Oklahoma City to help with a local Assemblies of God ministry group.<br>
Richard loved people and had an easy manner of reconnecting with old friends and making new friends especially among the younger generations. His love of God flowed out to others without pretense, because he already cared for and enjoyed the person he was speaking with. He had an abiding love and natural talent for music. His music ranged from worship to love songs to the funny irreverent. He played the guitar, piano and flute and shared all these things with his children and grandchildren. Worshipping his Lord God was the first memory his wife had of Richard.<br>
He enjoyed camping, fishing and shooting with his brothers and sons. He was an old gamer who enjoyed complex strategy games and online games he could play with his children. His fun sense of play found him playing and laughing with his children and grandchildren alike. He kept his wife laughing even through the hardest times, and she loved him for that.<br>
He fiercely loved his wife, children and grandchildren, which was returned in full measure.<br>
How do you sum up a person in a single written column? Like all of us, he was complex with both wonderful gifts and failures he was seeking to make right. He was a man who was learning and growing to the very end. He was a man who faced his fears and apologized for his mistakes. He was a man who encouraged others, prayed with and for them, and sought to leave them in a better place than he found them. He was a man we wanted more time with here, but recognize he is alive with Jesus, his redeemer.<br>
In 2020, he visited his mother and fatherʼs gravesite with his youngest daughter. It was a year after his momʼs death. He told her "the older I am, I realize my treasure is getting greater in heaven than it is on earth."<br>
Our treasure has grown and, though with tears now, we who love him are looking forward to a great reunion!<br>
Richard is survived by his wife, 5 children, 5 grandchildren, 3 siblings and many more family and friends.<br>
