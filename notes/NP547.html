COLOMA - Ronald Anthony Tomasini, 67, of Coloma passed away Sunday, Aug. 29, 2010, at Lakeland Regional Medical Center in St. Joseph.<br>
A Celebration of Life Service will be held 10:30 a.m. Thursday at Starks & Menchinger Family Funeral Home, 2650 Niles Road, St. Joseph. Cremation will follow the service. Friends may call from 5 to 8 p.m. Wednesday at the funeral home. Memorials may be made to Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation, American Cancer Society or St. Jude Children's Hospital. Those wishing to sign Ron's memory book online may do so at www.starks-menchinger.com.<br>
Ron lived life to the fullest during his 67 years. He was born and raised in Milwaukee to parents Frank and Lucille. He was the oldest of three siblings and grew to be a respected son, brother, husband, father and grandfather.<br>
Ron exemplified and instilled strong family values and an uncompromising work ethic in all who were blessed to know him. He raised three daughters and found immeasurable joy from his four grandchildren. After many years of service as the safety director for Leaseway Transportation, Ron retired. Never one to sit idly, he soon went back to work as "Ron the Sales Guy," working along side his daughters at Competitive Edge. He retired after 10 years of faithful and always fun-filled service to spend more time enjoying the true priorities of life, including his beloved wife of 20 years, Valorie, or a local game/event starring one of his fabulous four.<br>
Ron was proud of his Italian heritage and carefully carried out the traditions that had been handed to him, including the fabulous Christmas dinner, featuring the most amazing red sauce, meatballs and sausage one could ever imagine.<br>
He was at home on the St. Joe River and Lake Michigan or wherever the fish were biting. Ron had a perfectly scripted final week with us, taking time to have a record catch on the river, dinner with his wife, and lunches with his friends and daughters.<br>
Ron is survived by his wife, Valorie; three daughters, Mary Jo Tomasini (Fred Malawski) of St. Joseph, Paula Kay (Tom) Wygonik of Stevensville, Francine (Roger) Jordan of Coloma; four grandchildren, Jillian and Nicholas Wygonik and Faith and Noah Jordan; his sister, Pauline (Ron) Crews of Rio Vista, Calif.; his brother, John Tomasini (Mary Brown) of Steamboat Springs, Colo.; and his mother-in-law, Joyce Kraiger of Coloma.<br>
Ron will be greatly missed but never forgotten - like the lessons he so carefully placed in our hearts.<br>
