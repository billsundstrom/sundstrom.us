<h2>Notes</h2>
Matilda DE HUNTINGTON
<p>
<a name ="I006363"><b>[I006363]</b></a><br />
Maud, 2nd Countess of Huntingdon (1074-1130) was the daughter of Waltheof, Earl of Northumbria, the last of the major Anglo-Saxon earls to remain powerful after the Norman conquest in 1066. Her mother was Judith, a niece of William the Conqueror. She inherited her father's earldom of Huntingdon and married twice.<br>
<br>
Her mother, Judith, refused to marry Simon of St Liz. This refusal angered her uncle, King William, who confiscated Judith's estates after she fled the country. Instead her daughter Maud was married to Simon of St Liz in 1090. She had a number of children with St Liz including Simon and Maud.<br>
<br>
Her first husband died in 1109 and Maud next married King David I of Scotland in 1113. From this marriage she had four children, two sons, Malcolm and Henry and two daughters, Claricia and Hodierna. The Scottish royal house produced the remaining Earls of Huntingdon of the first creation of the title. She was succeeded to the Earldom of Huntingdon by her son Henry.<br>
<br>
According to John of Fordun, she died in 1130 and was buried at Scone, but she appears in a charter dated 1147.<br>
</p>
Pepin I DE LANDEN
<p>
<a name ="I004795"><b>[I004795]</b></a><br />
Saint Pippin of Landen, also known as Pippin the Elder (580 - 640), was the Frankish Mayor of the Palace of Austrasia under the Merovingian kings Clotaire II, Dagobert I and Sigebert III from 615 or 623 to 629.<br>
<br>
Children:<br>
    * Begga, who married Ansegisel, the son of Arnulf, Bishop of Metz. The son of this marriage, Pippin the Middle, was Charlemagne's great-grandfather.<br>
    * Gertrude (625 - 17 March 659) - Burried in the convent of Nijvel founded by her mother Itta. She was later canonised as a saint and is usually portrayed accompanied with mice.<br>
    * Grimoald, Mayor of the Palace of the Austrasia from 650 to 661<br>
</p>
Caribert DE LAON
<p>
<a name ="I004809"><b>[I004809]</b></a><br />
Charibert (also spelled Caribert and Heribert), Count of Laon, was the maternal grandfather of Charlemagne. He was the father of Charles's mother, Bertrada of Laon. Only his mother is known from contemporary records. In 721, Charibert signed, with his mother Bertrada of Prüm the foundation act of the Abbey of Prüm. The same year, also with his mother, he made a donation to the Abbey of Echternach. By 744, his daughter Bertrada of Laon had married Pippin the Younger, mayor of the palace of Neustria and Burgundy and later king of the Franks. He died before 762, as stated in an act of his daughter and son-in-law.<br>
</p>
Fernando II DE LEON
<p>
<a name ="I008276"><b>[I008276]</b></a><br />
Ferdinand II, king of Leon (d. 1188), was the son of Alfonso VII and of Berenguela, of the house of the counts of Barcelona. On the division of the kingdoms which had obeyed his father, he received León. His reign of thirty years was one of strife marked by no signal success or reverse. He had to contend with his unruly nobles, several of whom he put to death. During the minority of his nephew Alfonso VIII. of Castile he endeavoured to impose himself on the kingdom as regent. On the west he was in more or less constant strife with Portugal, which was in process of becoming an independent kingdom. His relations to the Portuguese house must have suffered by his repudiation of his wife Urraca, daughter of Alphonso I of Portugal. Though he took the king of Portugal prisoner in 1180, he made no political use of his success. He extended his dominions southward in Extremadura at the expense of the Moors. Ferdinand, who died in 1188, left the reputation of a good knight and hard fighter, but did not display political or organizing faculty.<br>
</p>
Konrad II DE LORRAINE
<p>
<a name ="I007866"><b>[I007866]</b></a><br />
Conrad the Red (died 955) was Duke of Lorraine and Franconia.<br>
<br>
He was the son of Werner, Count of Worms. In 947 he married Litgarde, daughter of Otto I, Holy Roman Emperor and Editha of Wessex, daughter of Edward the Elder, King of England. Conrad was killed in the battle of Lechfeld.<br>
</p>
Lothair I DE LORRAINE
<p>
<a name ="I005422"><b>[I005422]</b></a><br />
Lothair I (795 - March 2, 855), Holy Roman Emperor, was the eldest son of the emperor Louis the Pious and his wife Irmengarde (Ermengarde), daughter of Ingramm (Ingerman), the Duke of Hesbaye. Lothair is sometimes also known as "Lothar".<br>
<br>
Little is known of his early life, which was probably passed at the court of his grandfather Charlemagne, until 815 when he became ruler of Bavaria.<br>
<br>
When Louis in 817 divided the Empire between his sons, Lothar was crowned joint emperor at Aix-la-Chapelle (Aachen) and given a certain superiority over his brothers. In 821 he married Irmengarde (d. 851), daughter of Hugo (Hugues), count of Tours; in 822 undertook the government of Italy; and, on the April 5, 823, was crowned emperor by Pope Paschal I at Rome, Italy.<br>
<br>
In November 824 he promulgated a statute concerning the relations of pope and emperor which reserved the supreme power to the secular potentate, and he afterwards issued various ordinances for the good government of Italy.<br>
<br>
On his return to his father's court his step-mother Judith won his consent to her plan for securing a kingdom for her son Charles the Bald, a scheme which was carried out in 829. Lothar, however, soon changed his attitude, and spent the succeeding decade in constant strife over the division of the Empire with his father. He was alternately master of the Empire, and banished and confined to Italy; at one time taking up arms in alliance with his brothers and at another fighting against them; whilst the bounds of his appointed kingdom were in turn extended and reduced.<br>
<br>
When Louis I was dying in 840, he sent the imperial insignia to Lothar, who, disregarding the various partitions, claimed the whole of the Empire. Negotiations with his brother Louis the German and his half-brother Charles the Bald, both of whom armed to resist this claim, were followed by an alliance of the younger brothers against Lothar. A decisive battle was fought at Fontenay on June 25, 841, when, in spite of his personal gallantry, Lothar was defeated and fled to Aix. With fresh troops he entered upon a war of plunder, but the forces of his brothers were too strong for him, and taking with him such treasure as he could collect, he abandoned to them his capital.<br>
<br>
Efforts to make peace were begun, and in June 842 the brothers met on an island in the Saone, and agreed to an arrangement which developed, after much difficulty and delay, into the Treaty of Verdun signed in August 843. By this Lothair received Italy and the imperial title, together with a stretch of land between the North and Mediterranean Seas lying along the valleys of the Rhine and the Rhone. He soon abandoned Italy to his eldest son, Louis, and remained in his new kingdom, engaged in alternate quarrels and reconciliations with his brothers, and in futile efforts to defend his lands from the attacks of the Northmen (as Vikings were known in Frankish writings) and the Saracens.<br>
<br>
In 855 he became seriously ill, and despairing of recovery renounced the throne, divided his lands between his three sons, and on September 23, entered the monastery of Prüm (Pruem), where he died six days later. He was buried at Prüm, where his remains were found in 1860.<br>
<br>
His kingdom was divided among his three sons - the eldest, Louis II, received Italy and the title of Emperor; the second, Lothair II, received Lotharingia, while the youngest, Charles, received Burgundy.<br>
</p>
Louis II DE LORRAINE
<p>
<a name ="I005434"><b>[I005434]</b></a><br />
From Wikipedia<br>
<br>
Louis II, (825 - 875), Holy Roman Emperor (sole ruler 855 - 875), eldest son of the emperor Lothair I, became the designated king of Italy in 839, and taking up his residence in that country was crowned king at Rome by Pope Sergius II on June 15, 844.<br>
<br>
He at once preferred a claim to the rights of an emperor in the city, which claim was decisively rejected; but in 850 he was crowned joint emperor at Rome by Pope Leo IV, and soon afterwards married his cousin, Engelberga, a daughter of King Louis the German, and undertook the independent government of Italy. He took the field against the Saracens; quashed some accusations against Pope Leo; held a Diet at Pavia; and on the death of his father in September 855 became sole emperor.<br>
<br>
The division of Lothair's dominions, by which he obtained no territory outside Italy, aroused his discontent, and in 857 he allied himself with Louis the German against his own brother Lothair, King of Lotharingia, and King Charles the Bald. But after Louis had secured the election of Pope Nicholas I in 858, he became reconciled with his brother, and received some lands south of the Jura mountains in return for assistance given to Lothair in his efforts to obtain a divorce from his wife, Teutberga.<br>
<br>
In 863, on the death of his brother Charles, Louis received the kingdom of Provence, and in 864 came into collision with Pope Nicholas I over his brother's divorce. The archbishops, who had been deposed by Nicholas for proclaiming this marriage invalid, obtained the support of the emperor, who reached Rome with an army in February 864; but, having been seized with fever, he made peace with the pope and left the city.<br>
<br>
In his efforts to restore order in Italy, Louis met with considerable success both against the turbulent princes of the peninsula and against the Saracens who were ravaging southern Italy. In 866 he routed these invaders, but could not follow up his successes owing to the lack of a fleet. So in 869 he made an alliance with the eastern emperor, Basil I, who sent him some ships to assist in the capture of Ban, the headquarters of the Saracens, which succumbed in 871.<br>
<br>
Meanwhile his brother Lothair had died in 869, and owing to his detention in southern Italy, Louis failed to prevent the partition of Lotharingia between Louis the German and Charles the Bald. Some jealousy between Louis and Basil followed the victory at Ban, and in reply to an insult from the eastern emperor Louis attempted to justify his right to the title "emperor of the Romans." He had withdrawn into Benevento to prepare for a further campaign when he was treacherously attacked in his palace, robbed and imprisoned by Adeichis, prince of Benevento, in August 871. The landing of fresh bands of Saracens compelled Adeichis to release his prisoner a month later, and Louis was forced to swear he would take no revenge for this injury, nor ever enter Benevento with an army. Returning to Rome, he was released from his oath, and was crowned a second time as emperor by Pope Adrian II on May 18, 872.<br>
<br>
Then Louis won further successes against the Saracens, who were driven from Capua, but the attempts of the emperor to punish Adelchis were not very successful. Returning to northern Italy, he died, somewhere in the province of Brescia, on August 12, 875, and was buried in the church of St Ambrose at Milan, having named as his successor in Italy his cousin Carloman, son of Louis the German.<br>
</p>
Beatrice DE LOUVAIN
<p>
<a name ="I015285"><b>[I015285]</b></a><br />
She has been shown either as a daughter of Gerhard III of Upper Lorraine or of Henry III of Louvain.<br>
</p>
Hugh IX DE LUSIGNAN
<p>
<a name ="I005056"><b>[I005056]</b></a><br />
HHe is the grandson and successor of Hugh VIII, Lord de Lusignan, by his father Hugh, and the nephew of Guy and Amaury II of Lusignan, both kings of Jerusalem and Cyprus.<br>
<br>
He was betrothed to marriage to Isabel Taillefer, daughter of the Count of Angoulême, but John Lackland of England charmed to him broke the engagement in 1200. Hugh IX asked upon King of France, but John Lackland of England refused to present himself, which let the King confiscate their possessions in France. However Hugh IX had compromised with John Lackland of England, married Mahaut of Angouleme, daughter of Wulgrin II of Angouleme and cousin of Isabelle. This marriage eventually gave him Angouleme. In 1208, Hugh IX abdicated in favor of his son and finished his days in the Holy Lands. In 1220, his son Hugh X married Isabelle, the widowed of John Lackland of England.<br>
</p>
Hugh VI DE LUSIGNAN
<p>
<a name ="I015414"><b>[I015414]</b></a><br />
Despite of his piety, Hugh was constantly in conflict with the Abbey of Saint-Maixent. One of these many litigations became so violent that the duke of Aquitaine, the bishops of Poitiers and Pope Pascal II had to intervene. Because of these many conflicts, Hugues was called the devil, by the monks of Saint-Maixent.<br>
<br>
In 1086, the army catillane was beaten by Almoravides. Berenger Raymond II count de Barcelone, half-brother of Hugues was in turn threatened by Almoravides. Hugh VI organized an expedition to Spain with his other half-brother Raymond IV of Toulouse, to help the count of Barcelona.<br>
<br>
Hugh took the cross for the first crusade, with his brothers Raymond and Berenger-Raymond; He also took part in the crusade of help in 1101<br>
<br>
He married about 1065 Ildégarde de Thouars, daughter of Aimery II, Viscount of Thouars and Aurengarde de Mauléon.<br>
</p>
Hugh VII DE LUSIGNAN
<p>
<a name ="I015412"><b>[I015412]</b></a><br />
He accompanied Louis VII of France to the second crusade in 1147.<br>
</p>
Hugh VIII Le Brun DE LUSIGNAN
<p>
<a name ="I005060"><b>[I005060]</b></a><br />
He left the Holy Land in 1163. He may have died int 1165, but his son Hugh died in 1169 apparently before his father died, because the successor of Hugh VIII is his small son Hugues IX. Thae tiitle passes in 1172. Does this mean it is the date of death of Hugh VIII or that of the majority of Hugues IX?<br>

Geoffrey DE MANDEVILLE
<p>
<a name ="I007388"><b>[I007388]</b></a><br />
Geoffrey de Mandeville (d. c. 1100) was one of the great magnates of the reign of William the Conqueror. King William granted him large estates, primarily in Essex, but in 10 other shires as well. He served as sheriff in London and Middlesex, and perhaps also in Essex and in Hertfordshire. He may also have been custodian of the Tower of London.<br>
<br>
His lands were inherited by his son William de Mandeville.<br>
</p>
Geoffrey DE MANDEVILLE
<p>
<a name ="I007384"><b>[I007384]</b></a><br />
From Wikipedia<br>
<br>
Geoffrey de Mandeville, 1st Earl of Essex (d. 1144) was one of the prominent players during the Anarchy of the reign of King Stephen of England. His biographer, the historian J. H. Round, called him "the most perfect and typical presentment of the feudal and anarchic spirit that stamps the reign of Stephen."<br>
<br>
He succeeded his father, William sometime before 1130. A key portion of the family patrimony was in the king's hands, as William had incurred Henry I's displeasure and lost them, along with his office as constable of the Tower of London. The king also held the substantial estate of Geoffrey's maternal grandfather Eudo Dapifer.<br>
<br>
Geoffrey's goal in the early years of strife between Stephen and Maud seems to have to recover these losts lands. He succeeded in this, during the shifting tides of fortunes of the two competitors for the English throne, by bidding his support to first one, then the other.<br>
<br>
He started out supporting Stephen, who sometime in 1140 (or perhaps December 1139) made him Earl of Essex in reward for his services against Maud. In 1140 or 1141 Stephen returned to him the seized estates in Essex. In 1141 he was also appointed custodian of the Tower of London.<br>
<br>
After the defeat and capture of Stephen at Lincoln (1141) the earl deserted to Maud. She confirmed his custody of the Tower, forgave the large debts his father had incurred to the crown, granted him the Norman lands of Eduo Dapifer, and appointed him sheriff of Essex, Middlesex and London, and Hertfordshire. But before the end of the year, learning that Stephen's release was imminent, he returned to his original allegiance. In 1142 he was again intriguing with the empress; but before he could openly join her cause he was detected and deprived of his castles by the king.<br>
<br>
In 1143-1144 Geoffrey maintained himself as a rebel and a bandit in the fen-country, using the Isle of Ely and Ramsey Abbey as his headquarters. He was besieged by Stephen in the fens, and met his death in September 1144 in consequence of a wound received in a skirmish.<br>
<br>
His career is interesting for two reasons. The charters which he extorted from Stephen and Matilda illustrate the peculiar form taken by the ambitions of English feudatories. The most important concessions are grants of offices and jurisdictions which had the effect of making Mandeville a viceroy with full powers in Essex, Middlesex and London, and Hertfordshire. His career as an outlaw exemplifies the worst excesses of the anarchy which prevailed in some parts of England during the civil wars of 1140-1147, and it is probable that the deeds of Mandeville inspired the rhetorical description, in the Peterborough Chronicle of this period, when "men said openly that Christ and his saints were asleep."<br>
<br>
Geoffrey married Rohese de Vere, daughter of Aubrey de Vere. They had three sons:<br>
    * Ernulf, who was exiled and disinherited<br>
    * Geoffrey de Mandeville, 2nd Earl of Essex (d. 1166)<br>
    * William de Mandeville, 3rd Earl of Essex (d. 1189)<br>
</p>
William DE MANDEVILLE
<p>
<a name ="I007386"><b>[I007386]</b></a><br />
William de Mandeville (d. sometime between 1105 and 1116) inherited the estates of his father Geoffrey around 1100. He was constable of the Tower of London at that time, and thus keeper of the first person known to be imprisoned there for political reasons, Ranulf Flambard. Flambard's February 1101 escape would have significant consequences for William.<br>
<br>
It is not known if William was in some way a confederate of Flambard, or was simply a lax guardian. Either way, king Henry I apparently took away the heart of William's Essex estates. Little is known of William's activities after this.<br>
<br>
William probably married Margaret, daughter of Eudo Dapifer and Rohese de Clare. Their son Geoffrey would recover the seized estates, and gain much else besides.<br>
</p>
Almodis DE MARCHE
<p>
<a name ="I007470"><b>[I007470]</b></a><br />
From Wikipedia<br>
<br>
Almodis de la Marche (c. 1020-16 October 1071) was the daughter of Bernard I, Count of Marche. She married Hugh V of Lusignan around 1038 and they had one son:<br>
    * Hugh VI of Lusignan (c. 1039-1101)<br>
<br>
Almodis and Hugh of Lusignan divorced due to consanguinity, and Hugh arranged for her to marry Count Pons of Toulouse in 1040. Together they produced several children, including:<br>
    * William IV of Toulouse<br>
    * Raymond IV of Toulouse<br>
    * Almodis of Toulouse, married Count Pierre of Melgueil<br>
<br>
She was still Pons' wife in April 1053, but shortly thereafter Almodis was abducted by Ramon Berenguer I, Count of Barcelona. He kidnapped her from Narbonne with the aid of a fleet sent north by his ally, the Muslim emir of Tortosa. They married immediately (despite the fact both of her previous husbands were still alive) and they appear with their twin sons in a charter the next year. Pope Victor II excommunicated Almodis and Ramon for this illegal marriage until 1056. Together they produced four children:<br>
    * Berenguer Ramon II, Count of Barcelona<br>
    * Ramon Berenguer II, Count of Barcelona<br>
    * Inés of Barcelona, married Count Guigues I of Albon<br>
    * Sancha of Barcelona, married Count Guillermo Ramon I of Cerdagne<br>
<br>
Almodis maintained contact with her former husbands and many children, and in 1066/1067 she traveled to Toulouse for her daughter's wedding. A few years before, in 1060, Hugh V of Lusignan had revolted against his lord, Duke William VIII of Aquitaine, in support of Almodis' son William IV of Toulouse. Her sons supported one another in military campaigns; Hugh VI of Lusignan, Raymond IV of Toulouse, and Berenguer Ramon all took the Cross.<br>
<br>
Her third husband Ramon had a son from a previous marriage, Pedro Ramon, who was his heir. Pedro apparently resented Almodis' influence and was concerned she was trying to replace him with her own two sons. He murdered her in October 1071. Pedro was disinherited and exiled for his crime, and fled the country. When his father died in 1076, Barcelona was split between Berenguer Ramon and Ramon Berenguer, Almodis' sons. The family history of murder did not end with Pedro Ramon, as Berenguer Ramon earned his nickname "The Fratricide" when he killed his own twin brother.<br>
