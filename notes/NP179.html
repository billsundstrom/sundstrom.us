Arthur Severance FISKE
<p>
<a name ="I068989"><b>[I068989]</b></a><br />
ARTHUR SEVERANCE FISKE, graduated from Amherst College in 1884, and from Hartford Theological Seminary in 1887. Took a high position as a scholar in college, and won the fellowship in the seminary. By advice of the faculty spent three years in the University of Berlin, studying oriental languages, specially Arabic. Was ready to return and enter upon a professorship at Hartford when his health, which by constant study had been seriously impaired, suddenly failed, and he died at the age of 29. <br>
As a lad he was deeply interested in ornithology. While in college he had charge of the ornithological collection, arranging and classifying it, and adding sixty-seven varieties to the number. Manyof his drawings of birds and eggs were published by the Smithsonian Institute, and were helpful in settling some disputed points in New England ornithology. <br>
While in the seminary he made a Hebrew vocabulary of the Psalms. His proficiency in Arabic was very marked, and he left extensive translations from the literature of that people. He was interesting and instructive as a preacher, but important offered pulpits failed to lure him from his chosen course. Through native gifts and high attainments a promising career was open before him. "Flebilis multis occidit," and by a wide circle his death was regarded as a serious loss to American scholarship. "He was an enthusiast in Christian work as in study. He was an artist in soul, as well as with pencil, pen, and brush; a student of architecture, a keen naturalist, proficient especially in ornithology. In the vacations of his theological course, he had won an enviable reputation as writer, speaker and preacher, and important pulpits had been open for his pastorial charge. He turned, however, from all such offers, in his zeal for the highest Christian scholarship. The Hebrew Bible, with all the Orientalism in customs, language, literature, and monuments, which should interpret and illustrate it, was his chosen field. By special advanced studies in the seminary and by his subsequent years of work abroad he had become signally equipped for these lines of instruction."<br>

REV. ASA G. FISKE, D. D.<br>

Having retired from an active pastorate, which had included among others, leading Presbyterian churches in Washington, D.C., San Francisco and Ithaca, Dr. Fiske came to Cortland as stated supply for the First Presbyterian church during an interval between two pastorates in the latter part of 1907. Later he was for two years in charge of the work at the North Presbyterian chapel, before that became an independent church. During his residence here he formed many very warm friendships, and was always an acceptable preacher. The death of his wife occurred here on April 6. 1909.<br>
Dr. Fiske was born In Shelburne Falls, Mass., on March 2. 1833, and was educated at Arms academy at that place and at Amherst college, from which he was graduated in the class of 1855.<br>
He served a s a chaplain In the Union army through almost the entire period of the Civil war. He is survived by two daughters, Miss Christabel Fiske of Poughkeepsie and Mrs. Zoe Aldrich, whose husband is a member of the faculty of Tulane University at New Orleans. Nearly all his later year s have been spent with Prof, and Mrs. Aldrich at New Orleans. At the time of his death he was upon a visit at the home of his other daughter and death was the result of a fall sustained a short time before.<br>

Reverend Asa Seaverence Fiske b. Mar. 2, 1833, in Strongsville, Ohio; m. at Madison, Conn, Sept. 6, 1859, Elizabeth, Worthington Hand. He was born at Strongsville, Ohio, in a big storm of snow and wind, in a pioneer log house; was brought back to Massachusetts when about six years old; went to common schools; worked on the farm; taught school in New Jersey a year when he was 15 and when 17 got into college at Amherst in 1851. He taught school winters, got through with a house appointment at graduation; taught afterward at Canandaigua boys' boarding and day schools. Went to Andover Theological Seminary; was called back to Amherst as tutor; was licensed to preach by the Franklin County Congregational Association in 1857; was tutor at Amherst and preached all through western Massachusetts for two years; leaving there went to St. Paul, Minn, for rest; preached there for a new First Congregational Church-the Plymouth; was ordained and installed first pastor in 1859; married in 1859; enlisted in the army in 1861; was elected chaplain of the Fourth Minnesota Volunteer Infantry same year; went into the field first after the battle of Shiloh; served through the war with his regiment or on detailed service, by special order of Gen. Grant. He returned to civil life in the summer of 1865; entered at once on the pastorate of the Second Congregational Church of Rockville, Conn, which was nearly doubled in strength in the course of a five years' ministry there; was called thence to St. Peters Presbyterian Church of Rochester, N.Y in 1870; the church grew and he paid off an old debt of $30,000. Then he was unexpectedly called to the Flarvard Church, San Francisco, Cal. In that city he remained in the pastorate of the Harvard Street Church for nine years. Thence he was called to the pastorate of the First Church, Ithaca, N. Y , where he still is. In the war times with Gen. John Eaton, J r , he had a large hand in organizing freedmens affairs on the Mississippi River; armed and equipped the first colored company of soldiers: built two log house towns of more than 1,000 houses each, and married 119 couples in half an hour. He was sent by Gen. Grant to Washington to endeavor to prevent the transfer of freedmen's affairs to a civil department, and to keep it in the department of war. Sumner's bill for such transfer was defeated and the Freedmen's Bureau was organized in the war office as was desired. He was employed afterward by the Bureau of Education to visit and report on the various penal and reformatory institutions of New England and the Middle States. Papers published in Reports of Bureau of Education, Washington, D.C. He was afterward invited to go as Government Commissioner to an International Conference in London, of the departments of education of the various governments of europe and the United States, and to examine and report on the European National Educational systems, and their working. But, as he had only lately accepted (?) to the church at Rochester and as it was anxious for his immediate service, he was constrained to decline so inviting an appointment. He has been too busy to write any books. A good many sermons and addresses on various occasions have been published and he has tried to do his duty by the newspapers religious and others as well as he could, and in all the reforms, temperance, civil service and civic federation lines as well as he has been able.<br>

<p>
<a name ="I069050"><b>[I069050]</b></a><br />
When Christabel Fiske (1869-1956) died, Helen Lockwood, a former colleague, praised her as "one of Vassarʼs great women." From 1903 to 1940 Miss Fiske taught English at Vassar, a career for which she prepared at Cornell and Columbia University, now George Washington University. She had a wide range of literary interest, including English and German medieval literature, Milton, and the study of language. Known as a stimulating teacher who took great pains to develop each studentʼs abilities, Miss Fiske was reputed to dismiss classes when she found the students were unprepared. She was editor of the Vassar Medieval Studies and, for fourteen years, of the Vassar Journal of Undergraduate Studies.<br>

David FISKE
<p>
<a name ="I068743"><b>[I068743]</b></a><br />
David Fiske was born on the top of one of the beautiful hills of Shelburne, Franklin Co., Mass. He had a good common school education, and married Laura Severance, who was born in the same town. Previous to his marriage he had formed a partnership with two other young men for building and running a saw mill, a grist mill and a cloth factory at the falls of the Deerfield river, then called Salmon Falls, from the abundance of that fish caught there. These falls made a fine water power and the banks on either side were owned by Captain Martin Severance, Laura's father. For nearly twenty years he was the head of these establishments, and then chief owner. He built a pretty little house on the river side for his bride. In it were born his eight children, and there three of them died. <br>
There also their golden wedding was celebrated and there his beloved wife died, after 56 years of married life. In 1832 he sold out his manufacturing interests, having caught the western fever, and removed with his family to Ohio, making the long journey from Albany over the Erie canal by packet boat, then considered a rapid and luxurious mode of travel, and by lake to Cleveland, which was then but a pretty group of fourteen houses under the bluflf by the river. There he first bought 180 acres on the bluff on which now stands the whole business <br>
part of Cleveland. But, he wanted a farm, and found better soil out at Strongsville, 18 miles southwest, and exchanged his purchase of the Cleveland site for twice as many acres, where into whose black soil he could thrust a "sabre's tail clear up to the head;" where into the hollow trunk of a fallen sycamore a man could walk upright with a tall hat on and where the black walnut trees made grand rails for fences. Six rails and posts, and rider high to keep the deer from the crops. He sold his farm on which he had built a fine house, the first between <br>
Cleveland and southern Ohio. The raising of that house was an event. He and his wife had seen too much of the baleful effects of rum in New England, it was wholly banished from their house and they determined to raise the heavy black walnut frame without its aid. They notified everybody for twenty miles around of this "raising" "without rum." Everybody said that nobody would come and the frame would have to go up on such terms. But everybody came to see and jest at the failure of these temperance cranks. When they came, however, they found a magnificent spread of mother's best cookery and long tables under fine trees and a half a dozen pretty girls to serve them and so knew that no stinginess was at the bottom of it and the boss and carpenters gave them a good report of the way they were treated by the new-comers, and all turned in to the work right merrily and the raising went oS fine and after the jolly feast that crowned it the ringleader of the crowd which came to show them that they could not raise a house without rum, mounted a table and made a speech, saying that it was the best raisin' he had ever heard of, and that Mrs Fiske was the handsomest woman and the best hostess in Ohio. At that the whole crowd thanked her and her husband for having raised their house without rum, so that they were all going home sober and yet jolly, and then the crowd gave a rousing cheer and swung their hats, and the impossible was achieved. Some <br>
kinsmen who had settled over in Michigan in Sarnia now, Jackson then, had written that there they had no fever and that there was a fine farm there for him, so they packed up their goods into covered wagons drawn by horses and cattle, and went across the black swamp, a trip of six weeks. Took the new farm and found their old enemy had followed them from Ohio so they were after a couple of years shaken out of Michigan and out of the western fever as well, and returned to <br>
Melburne, where he bought a part of the large farm on which he was born. He ultimately exchanged it for a part of the farm on which his wife was born at the Falls, and finally, it still standing, he bought the identical house he had built for his bride, moved into it and there in 1867 his beloved wife died in the very room where eight of her children had been born. <br>
After her death he lived for eight years (part of the time only, the summers) with his eldest son, Orlando, in Shelburne, or with his brother Samuel, yet spending about two thirds of his time <br>
with his son Asa in Rochester and with Mrs. Hart in Philadelphia or New Haven.<br>
He fell asleep at 85 in his brother's house in Shelburne, in the fall of 1875, after an hour or two of suffering, with his eldest son at his bedside. He was of a most gentle, genial, kindly nature, a lover of music, of fun, of man and of God, was for many years a deacon in the Congregational Church and respected and honored by all who knew him. In his old age he straightened up after his life of hard work, grew stouter, let his luxuriant silver beard grow full, and was a marvelously fine picture of hearty, alert and serene age. His two eldest daughters married clergymen, and the eldest son, for his first wife, a sister of Fidelia Fiske. Two others of the family attained merited distinction as clergymen and authors. <br>

  When on the farm, up the West Notch a mile or so, I had assigned chores. Bringing water for the house, feeding hens, gathering eggs, milking, help cutting wood for the stove, helped plant corn and potatoes, pitched hay and drove the team on a hayfork. In the fall, dug potatoes, picked corn and thrashed beans with a flail, one short stick tied to a longer stick (handle) with a leather cord.<br>
  Several summers before leaving for college, I lived at home but worked out. Two summers I worked for a contractor (Mr. Singer) mostly building cement walks for the village of Richburg. All cement was mixed and handled by short handled shovel. The first week I felt like giving up. Worked beside a mature man (Mr. Spears) who had spent several years grading railroad ties, etc. He could handle a shovel. I doubt if there were long handled shovels at this time. By two weeks I could shovel either right or left. Ten hours was a dayʼs work and often we worked twelve to finish the job. No overtime pay.<br>
  Another summer I worked for a farmer on the East Branch, North of Richburg. He was down right tight. He would say to me, "Now while we rest for a moment we will go over and cut a few blocks of firewood." I know he bought brown sugar and mixed it with maple sugar, selling it at maple syrup prices, for maple syrup.<br>
  One summer I worked for Mr. Daugherty an oilman of Bolivar. I believe a father (priest) had an interest in the lease. Father came several times while I was working, breath smelled rather strong of his morning drink. This was heavy work, digging forms in the earth, breaking stones for cement. These large cement foundations were for engine blocks and power wheels used in the oil business. All cement mixing, etc., by hand shovel. They paid me well.<br>
  Another summer I worked on a farm at Myrtle, below Little Genesee, NY. Lived with a farmer, his name, Paris Green. He was Laura Fisk Hasardʼs grandfather, a good man but awful poor in worldly goods.<br>
  Worked for Mr. Kriley away upon a hill west of Richburg. He had a large farm, also oil producer. I used my bicycle to and from work, walked the bicycle half way up to work so I could ride it back at night. Before starting home, I would go over all the nuts and tires. Away I went. Seldom did I meet anyone. Had road all to myself. Some of the pumpers along the road said I rode too fast. But I was cocky and sure of myself. Near the bottom of the hill was a wooden bridge 10 or 15 foot. I know there were times I never touched that bridge.<br>
  Then I pasted and trimmed wallpaper for my father. He paid me well - so well that I missed a year of High School to work with him. He did not approve for he wanted me to get an education. All one summer we worked papering and painting the interior of the Newton House in Bolivar. Went back home only weekends. We lived well that summer at the Newton House. We ate in the dining room and the waitresses seemed to enjoy having me eat. Often I had two or three pieces of pie, etc.<br>
  The summer before I was married I painted houses in Hebron, PA.<br>
  Remember one house owned by Mr. Ball. There is where I picked up a nail in my foot. Bothered me for several weeks. While my parents lived at Hebron I made several cross-country trips to Roulette, PA. Over the hills and farmlands by the way of Crandall Hill. By walking up hill and running down it did not take long to cover 10 or 15 miles.<br>
  One summer while we were home from Bristol, TN, I worked for Father Lyman on the farm, but mostly with Elden Barr on the Roulette water lines and installing plumbing here and there.<br>
