She lived with him in Pennsylvania during WW II, and then later moved to Corning, NY. She raised three boys despite difficulty resulting from a leg injury in her childhood. She over came most of that adversity by keeping busy with her sons activities, preparing wonderful meals, making costumes for the school plays and Halloween, furniture restoration as a hobby and teaching leatherworking to the Womens Club. In the early 1960s, she moved with her family to Big Flats, where she volunteered for the Welcome Wagon, and worked as a bookkeeper for Kens Hair Stylists and others.

Anyone who has known her will fondly remember her petite stature, her love of all things good, her cute smile, and her eagerness to help others. She will be fondly missed, and dearly. A Memorial Service honoring her life will be celebrated in the First Presbyterian Church 201 North Hamilton Street Painted Post, NY on Friday, June 2, 2006 at 3:00 PM. The Reverend Richard R.

John F. ''Jack'' O'Shea , of South Toledo, a survivor of Japan's surprise attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941, died yesterday in St. Luke's Hospital of esophageal cancer. He was 81. <br>
Mr. O'Shea was a glassworker at Libbey-Owens-Ford Co. 43 years, retiring in 1978. <br>
A Navy veteran of World War II, he was stationed on the USS New Orleans at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, when Japanese aircraft attacked the morning of Dec. 7. <br>
Mr. O'Shea and his close friend, Dean B. Orwick of Toledo, had planned to meet that morning on shore. Mr. O'Shea 's ship escaped heavy damage, but Mr. Orwick was killed aboard the USS Curtiss. Mr. O'Shea didn't learn about Mr. Orwick's death for months. <br>
The pair, along with a third friend, Rudy Polka, who was also stationed at Pearl Harbor, had grown up in East Toledo, sharing an interest in amateur short-wave radio. <br>
The Blade reported on the trio in a story last year on the 56th anniversary of the event that drew the United States into World War II. <br>
Mr. O'Shea's son, John M. O'Shea , said his father was an active member of the Navy Club and the Pearl Harbor Survivor's Association, but that he did not talk much about the event. <br>
''One of his best friends was killed there,'' John O'Shea said. ''He didn't dwell on it. He was a very quiet man.'' <br>
He said his father stayed active in amateur radio and was skilled in Morse code. <br>
In 1991, U.S. Rep. Marcy Kaptur presented a medal to Mr. O'Shea to mark the 50th anniversary of the Pearl Harbor attack. <br>
Mr. O'Shea was a member of St. Charles Catholic Church in South Toledo. <br>
Surviving are his wife, Marion; sons, John , Thomas, and James, and brother, Robert. <br>
Services will be Monday at 11 a.m. at the Coyle Funeral Home, South Reynolds Road, where the body will be after 2 p.m. tomorrow, and where a Rosary will be recited at 7:30 p.m. tomorrow. <br>
The family requests tributes to St. Charles Catholic Church or a charity of the donor's choice.<br>
