Marguerite BERENGER
<p>
<a name ="I007622"><b>[I007622]</b></a><br />
Marguerite of Provence (Forcalquier, Spring 1221- December 21, 1295, Paris) was the eldest daughter of Ramon Berenguer IV, Count of Provence and Beatrice of Savoy.<br>
Her paternal grandparents were Alfonso II, Count of Provence and Gersende II de Sabran, Countess of Forcalquier. Her maternal grandparents were Thomas I of Savoy and Marguerite of Geneva, daughter of William I of Geneva and Beatrice de Faucigny.<br>
Her younger sisters were:<br>
Eleanor of Provence became the Queen consort of Henry III of England.<br>
Sanchia of Provence who became the Queen consort of Richard, Earl of Cornwall and rival King of the Germans.<br>
Beatrice of Provence who was the Queen consort of Charles I of Sicily<br>
On 27 May 1234 at the age of thirteen, Marguerite became the Queen consort of Louis IX of France, by whom she had eleven children.<br>
Marguerite, like her sisters, was noted for her beauty, she was said to be "pretty with dark hair and fine eyes", and in the early years of their marriage she and Louis enjoyed a warm relationship. Her Franciscan confessor, William de St. Pathus, related that on cold nights Marguerite would place a robe around Louis' shoulders, when her deeply religious husband rose to pray. Another anecdote recorded by St. Pathus related that Marguerite felt that Louis' plain clothing was unbecoming to his royal dignity, to which Louis replied that he would dress as she wished, if she dressed as he wished. However, the chronicler Joinville noted with disapproval that Louis rarely asked after his wife and children, and in later years Louis became vexed with Marguerite's ambition.<br>
She accompanied Louis on his first crusade and was responsible for negotiations and ransom when he was captured. She was thus for a brief time the only woman ever to lead a crusade. During this period, while in Damietta, she gave birth to Jean Tristran.<br>
After the death of Louis on his second crusade, during which she remained in France, she returned to Provence.<br>
She was devoted to her sister Queen Eleanor of England, and they stayed in contact until Eleanor's death in 1291. Marguerite herself died four and a half years after her sister, on 21 December 1295. She was seventy-four years old.<br>
<br>
Marguerite herself became the Queen consort of Louis IX of France and mother to eleven children.<br>
   1. Blanche (1240-April 29, 1243)<br>
   2. Isabelle (March 2, 1241-January 28, 1271), married Theobald V of Champagne<br>
   3. Louis (February 25, 1244-January 1260)<br>
   4. Philippe III (May 1, 1245-October 5, 1285)<br>
   5. Jean (born and died in 1248)<br>
   6. Jean Tristan (1250-August 3, 1270)<br>
   7. Pierre (1251-1284)<br>
   8. Blanche (1253-1323), married Ferdinand de la Cerda<br>
   9. Marguerite (1254-1271), married John I, Duke of Brabant<br>
  10. Robert, Count of Clermont (1256-February 7, 1317). He was the ancestor of King Henry IV of France.<br>
  11. Agnes of France (c. 1260-December 19, 1327), married Robert II, Duke of Burgundy<br>

Ramon BERENGUER
<p>
<a name ="I007679"><b>[I007679]</b></a><br />
From Wikipedia<br>
<br>
Ramon Berenguer I el Vell ("the Old") was Count of Barcelona in 1035-1076. He promulgated the earliest versions of a written code of Catalan law, the Usages of Barcelona.<br>
<br>
Born in 1024, he succeeded his father, Berenguer Ramon the Crooked in 1035. It is during his reign that the dominant position of Barcelona among other Catalan counties became evident.<br>
<br>
Ramon Berenguer campaigned against the Moors, extending his dominions as far west as Barbastro and imposing heavy tributes (parias) on other Moorish cities. Historians claim that those tributes helped create the first wave of prosperity in Catalan history. During his reign Catalan maritime power started to be felt in Western Mediterranean. Ramon Berenguer the Old was also the first count of Catalonia to acquire lands (counties of Carcassonne and Razés) and influence north of the Pyrenees.<br>
<br>
Another major achievement of his was beginning of codification of Catalan law in the written Usatges or Usatici of Barcelona which was to become the first full compilation of feudal law in Western Europe. Legal codification was part of the count's efforts to forward and somehow control the process of feudalization which started during the reign of his weak father, Berenger Ramon. Another major contributor was the Church acting through the institution of the Peace and Truce of God. This established a general truce among warring factions and lords in a given region for a given time. The earliest extant date for introducing the Truce of God in Western Europe is 1027 in Catalonia, during the reign of Ramon Berenguer the Old.<br>
<br>
He was succeeded by his twin sons Ramon Berenguer II and Berenguer Ramon II.<br>

Ramon BERENGUER
<p>
<a name ="I007659"><b>[I007659]</b></a><br />
From Wikipedia<br>
<br>
Ramon Berenguer IV, Count of Barcelona the Saint ( b. ca. 1113, d. August 6, 1162) is most known for effecting the union between Catalonia and Aragon.<br>
<br>
He inherited the county of Barcelona from his father Ramon Berenguer III on August 19, 1131. On August 11, 1137 in Huesca he was betrothed to the infant Petronila of Aragon, aged 3 at the time. Her father, Ramiro II of Aragon the Monk, who sought Barcelona's aid against Alfonso VII of Castile, abdicated on November 13 that same year, leaving his kingdom to Petronila and her husband. The latter essentially became ruler of Aragon, although he never styled himself king, but instead Count of Barcelona, Prince of the Kingdom of Aragon. He was the last Catalan monarch to use the title of Count as his first; starting with his son Alfonso II of Aragon the counts of Barcelona styled themselves, in the first place, as kings of Aragon.<br>
<br>
The treaty between Ramon Berenger and his father-in-law stipulated that their descendants would rule jointly over both realms. Even should Petronila die before the marriage could be consummated, Barcelona would still inherit the Crown of Aragon. Both realms would preserve their laws, institutions and autonomy, remaining legally distinct but federated in a dynastic union under one ruling House.<br>
<br>
Historians consider this arrangement the political masterstroke of the Hispanic Middle Ages. Both realms gained greater strength and security and Aragon got its much needed outlet to the sea. On the other hand, formation of a new political entity in the southeast at a time when Portugal seceded from Castile in the west gave more balance to the Christian kingdoms of the peninsula.<br>
<br>
Ramon Berenguer successfully pulled Aragon out of its pledged submission to Castile, aided no doubt by the beauty and charm of his sister Berenguela, wife of Alfonso the Emperor, for which she was well-known in her time. After that, in the middle years of his rule, his attention turned to campaigns against the Moors. In 1147 he helped Castile to conquer Almerı́a. In 1148 he turned against the lands of the Almoravid taifa kingdom of Valencia and Murcia, capturing Tortosa and, the next year, Fraga, Lleida and Mequinenza in the confluence of the Segre, Cinca and Ebro. The reconquista of the actual Catalonia was complete.<br>
<br>
Ramon Berenger also campaigned in Provence, helping his brother Berenguer Ramon and his infant nephew Ramon Berenguer II against Counts of Toulouse. During the minority of Ramon Berenger II the Count of Barcelona also acted as the regent of Provence (between 1144 and 1157).<br>
<br>
In 1151 Ramon Berenguer the Saint founded and endowed the royal monastery of Poblet. He died in 1162 in Borgo Sam Dalmazzo, Piedmont, Italy, leaving his Aragon and Catalonia to his eldest son Ramon Berenguer, who, in compliment to the Aragonese, changed his name to Alfonso and became Alfonso II of Aragon, I of Catalonia. Ramon Berenguer's younger son Pedro inherited the county of Cerdagne and lands north of the Pyrenees.<br>
<br>
Ramon Berenguer's marriages and descendants<br>
    * First wife, Petronila of Aragon<br>

Ramon Berenguer II the Towhead (1053 or 1054 - December 5, 1082) was Count of Barcelona, 1076-1082. He ruled jointly with his twin brother Berenguer Ramon II.<br>
<br>
He succeeded his father Ramon Berenguer I, Count of Barcelona to co-rule with his twin brother Berenguer Ramon, in 1075.<br>
<br>
The twins failed to agree and divided their possessions between them, against the will of their late father. Ramon Berenguer the Towhead, called so because of the thickness and colour of his hair, was killed while hunting in the woods in 1082. His brother, who went on to become the sole ruler of Catalonia, was credited by popular opinion of having orchestrated this murder. Berenguer Ramon the Fratricide was later succeeded by Ramon Berenguer's son Ramon Berenguer III.<br>

From Wikipedia<br>
<br>
Ramon Berenguer III the Great was Count of Barcelona, Girona and Osona from 1082-1131 and Count of Provence, Holy Roman Empire, from 1112.<br>
<br>
Born in 1082 in Rodez, he was the son of Ramon Berenguer II. He succeeded his father to co-rule with his uncle Berenguer Ramon II. After 1097, when Berenguer Ramon II was forced into exile, he was the sole ruler.<br>
<br>
During his rule Catalan interests were extended on both sides of the Pyrenees. By marriage or vassalage he incorporated into his realm almost all of the Catalan counties (except those of Urgell and Peralada). He inherited the counties of Besalú (1111) and Cerdagne (1117) and in between married Douce, heiress of Provence (1112). Now his dominions stretched as far east as Nice.<br>
<br>
In alliance with the Count of Urgell Ramon Berenguer conquered Barbastro and Balaguer. In 1118 he captured and rebuilt Tarragona, which became the metropolitan seat of the church in Catalonia (before that, Catalans had depended ecclesiastically on the archbishopric of Narbonne). He also established relations with the Italian maritime republics of Pisa and Genoa and in 1114-1115 raided with them the Moorish pirate strongholds of Majorca and Ibiza. They became his tributaries and many Christian slaves were recovered and set free. Jointly with Pisa Ramon Berenguer also raided Muslim dependencies on the mainland, including lands of Valencia, Lleida and Tortosa.<br>
<br>
Toward the end of his life Ramon Berenguer became a Templar. He gave his five Catalonian counties to his eldest son Ramon Berenguer IV and Provence to the younger son Berenguer Ramon.<br>
