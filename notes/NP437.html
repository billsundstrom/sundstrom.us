<p>
<a name ="I099442"><b>[I099442]</b></a><br />
Einan's at Sunset On November 1, 2016 Barbara F. Bench joined the love of her life (Husband Allen T Bench) in Heaven. She started that journey surrounded by her loving family just as Allen had done in the same place twelve years before. Barbara was born July 30, 1932, in San Francisco, CA. to Harold and Nola Pratt. She grew up living in various cities in the west but really enjoyed living in Ballard, WA until her Dad started working at Hanford settling in Richland, WA. In 1984 she moved to Kennewick to start her wonderful life with Allen and after his passing she continued to live in Kennewick next to Paula and just a few blocks from Nola, and Kara and Jared and Erin and all her great grandchildren. Barbara met and married Wilmer T Alderman in 1950. Together they had two daughters. Nola was first and then eleven years later Paula was born. Wilmer and Barbara divorced after 25 years. Barbara then worked for many years out at Hanford doing various jobs but retired as a Security Clerk/ Escort. While working at Hanford she met and married the love of her life, Allen T Bench. Family was very important to Barbara and she and her mom and her grandmother and Nola (and Guy) all lived within blocks of each other around Wright street in Richland. This really led to a closeness of the generations and made frequent get togethers easy. She was a precious sole, a loving mom and a best friend. Barbara was a grandmother to Kara, Erin and Jared, then became a great grandmother to Tori, Ethan, Chloe, Alexis and Regann Barbara her name sake. Last year she had the joy of becoming a great-great grandmother to Finn. When Barbara and Allen retired they spent many months traveling around the United States in their 5th wheel then later their motor home. They enjoyed many beautiful bonfires and making friends with various people along the way. They adopted a dachshund, Kristina, who became their world. She went everywhere with them and was completely spoiled. After Allen passed away, she stayed busy with her family and volunteering. She loved being able to help anyone she could. Her smile was unmatched and her laugh contagious. Her caring spirit was limitless. She enjoyed volunteering at Sails Outlet for many years. Her other passion was animals. Barbara would gather every blanket, towel, toy she could for the Humane Society. Many trips were made there to donate trunks full of these items. Barbara enjoyed gardening in her yard and loved her houseplants. The past couple years she has enjoyed spending time with her family and her two dogs, Rufus and Brigette, who were both rescues. She loved to watch wrestling and John Cena was her favorite of all time. She was a huge Seahawks fan and loved the fact her grandkids and great grandkids were also huge fans. She wouldn't allow anyone to leave her home without them knowing how much she loved them and made sure they got a hug and kisses. Barbara is survived by her daughters, Nola Lobdell, Paula Moeller and Douglas Moeller, her step-daughter Deborah Snapp and Warren Snap, her grandchildren, Kara and Jim Kent, Erin Moeller, and Jared Moeller. Her great grandchildren Tori and Dillon McManamon, Ethan Clement, Chloe Clement, Alexis Clement and her precious Regann Barbara Kent and her great-great grandchild Finn McManamon. Barbara was preceded in death by her parents, her son in-law Guy Lobdell and the love of her life Allen Bench. There are no words to describe how much she will be missed in all of our lives. <br>

<p>
<a name ="I102604"><b>[I102604]</b></a><br />
Our beautiful and beloved Evelyn left this earth March 25, 2012, after a short illness. <br>
Evelyn was born to Emil and Amy (Bonewitz) Preisig on April 23, 1924, in Brodhead, Wisconsin. Her parents moved to Clarno, Wisconsin where she grew up and attended grade school in a one room brick school house. The one teacher in the school, Rudy Kuntz, taught all the grade levels, first through eighth grade. She attended high school in Monroe, Wisconsin. She grew up playing with dolls and in the woods behind their house with her sister, Esther, and childhood friend, Ruthella. <br>
After graduating from Monroe High School she worked at a monument shop as a bookkeeper for a man who cut gravestones. Later, she worked at Fairbanks Morse Company in the tabulating department. During this time her future husband, Harold, had an arranged meeting on the night shift. They had their first date ice skating on a creek in Beloit. They shared movies and dancing to the tunes of the Big Band Era during which time they became engaged. Harold left for military service soon after. During his training time in the Navy in Chicago, they decided to get married on a weekend leave on January 27, 1945. Following his discharge from the Navy, they enjoyed several months together until Harold obtained a job in Denver, Colorado. After this, Harold accepted a job with General Electric in Richland, Washington, where their two daughters were born. They were introduced to Westside Church. Evelyn was active in Church Women United, served a Scout leader and organized the Teen Canteen for youth after school activities. She was active in the Tri-City Camera Club where she received several awards for her artistic photography abilities. Harold and Evelyn were introduced to Westside Church, where she served the Lord through her many contributions to the church. She served as deacon and elder, and was on the building committee, where she was the only woman on that committee. She also did wedding planning and Bible studies. She was a devoted stay at home mom, raising their two daughters during this time. <br>
During her more than sixty years in Richland she and her family enjoyed camping, vacation travels, waterskiing and hiking, train trips and Nordic skiing in the Blue Mountains. After several years of health ailments she experienced a slow decline while receiving care at the Richland Rehabilitation Center. After over a month at Richland Rehab, she experienced a sudden and rapid decline in one day requiring transportation to ER, and the Lord taking in his arms in that same day. She received many encouraging cards and prayers from dear friends and relatives, and enjoyed those many cards and prayers. <br>

In 1979, as a member of the Standing Liturgical Commission of the Episcopal Church, Dr. Price helped reshape the Book of Common Prayer, the Anglican Church's primary worship guide. The commission made the first changes since 1928, updating language from the Elizabethan era, adding a variety of prayers for major rites and accentuating the role of the lay churchgoer in ceremonies."<br>
"Charlie is a lifelong Episcopalian, but he had sort of a scientific mind," said the Rev. Peter J. Gomes, Dr. Price's successor in 1972 as minister of Memorial Church at Harvard. "He was trained as a mathematician. So there was this piety on one hand and his awareness of the language and the mood of 20th-century technology. That moved him to try to make sure the language of his own church spoke as clearly and articulately in 20th-century lingo as possible."<br>
During World War II, Dr. Price was an engineer in the Navy and served on two destroyers in the Pacific. He also taught marine engineering at the U.S. Naval Academy from 1942 to 1943.<br>
