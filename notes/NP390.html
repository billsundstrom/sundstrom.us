During his career years, he worked as a barber to put himself through college, then for LSI Testing, Walter Kidde & Company, and finally for Hewlett Packard in 1977. He traveled the world doing computer systems installation and repair. He retired from HP in 2000, after working there 27 years.<br>

Sara Kristine NELSON
<p>
<a name ="I026883"><b>[I026883]</b></a><br />

It appears that her biological mother is MaryLou Gonnerman of Luverne, MN.<br>

Nils Anton NEWBOM
<p>
<a name ="I031733"><b>[I031733]</b></a><br />
"Already on the scene of action was Anton Newbom who in 1910 settled on a tract of land he had bought from Burke & Farrar up on Virginia Street, near Kirkland Avenue. Eighty acres of the original plats were to be used for factories in the vicinity.  There were no roads past Piccadilly except trail's. One was made for lumber to be hauled for the two-room house Mr. Newbom built immediately for his family. He was a plasterer in Seattle.<br>
Where the Civic Center now stands was Bonnell's nursery, and once there had been a brick-yard on the same spot. Bricks for chimneys for the new  Newbom house were gotten there, donated by Bonnells.<br>
Mr. Newborn and a Scot, Malcolm McLoed, who afterwards went to Black Diamond, worked dismantling the steel mill buildings and piling the sheets of corrugated tin. Mr. Newbom tells that on one night the tin was in place and next morning it was not, not any place in sight."<br>

Nils T. Newbom<br>
 On December 13th, 2012, Nils Theodore Newbom finished his great hunt. Born in 1941, he was the son of Ted and Helen Newbom (Cruikshank). He grew up in Redmond, Washington and attended Redmond High School.<br>
 Nils lived with his wife Carol and his beloved Labradors, Lucy Goosey and Tola Duckdog in Cathlamet Washington. He also left behind his children, Andy, Sarah and Jason in addition to 6 grandchildren. (Jacob, Aaron, Austin, Audrey, Blaze and Emme Luna) Nils was intensely proud of his children and cherished watching them grow into families.<br>
 Nils served in the Navy as a traffic controller on the USS Corral Sea and later went on to have a career as a construction engineer and real estate developer. A fanatical hunter and fisherman who spent more time outdoors than anywhere else combined with his ability to train the best hunting dogs made him the envy of all his friends.<br>
 All of his dogs were spoiled with love and lucky to have him as their best friend. Cut from the kind of cloth they don't seem to make anymore Nils was the type of rugged outdoorsman who believed if you didn't hit it with your first shot you didn't deserve another. Nils never needed a second shot.<br>
 The world was a more bright and colorful place when he was in it. And the worldʼs smoke and mirrors were less confusing. He was worth knowing. May he ever hunt where the game is thick and the fish always bite and his dogs always get the bird.<br>
 A service will be held at Dowling Funeral Chapel on February 5, 2013, at 11 a.m.<br>
