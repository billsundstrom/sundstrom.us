Contains a complete record of all records wherein Robert Bartlett is mentioned. He was one of the group that accompanied Thomas Hooker to America, but there is no record of him in Cambridge. He first appears on record in Hartford in 1639, about the time he married. It is suggested that in 1632 Robert Bartlett was a young, single man, perhaps a servant to one of the other passengers. An inventory of the estate of Robert Bartlett was presented at court on 29 Mar 1676 by his widow, Ann Bartlett. It totalled 658 pounds, 18 schillings, and 6 pence which was sizable for the time. This record also contains records of his wife's will and Samuel Bartlett's request to the court that he be put in charge of his brother, Nathaniel Bartlett's, share since he was not competant to administer them himself.<br>

Note:<br>
"Bartlett", A diminutive of the Bartholoew, - little Bart, originally spelled Bartelot, the family traced to Adam Bartelot, who came over with William the Conquer granted lands in Stopham, Sussex, England<br>
<br>
The Bartlett Family in England descended from Adam Bartelot, a Norman, who in 1066 accompanied William the Conqueror from France to England. (Commemorative Biographical Record Pg 506)<br>
(Source of information - Directory of the Ancestral Heads of New England)<br>
<br>
The Lyon left Bristol, England on June 22, 1632 and at that time Robert took the oath of allegiance to the King and government of England before he embarked. After being at sea for twelve weeks, they arrived at Boston Harbor on Sunday evening, September 16, 1632. The passengers on that ship brought with them the Charter which was long afterwards protected from seizure by being hidden in the famous Charter Oak and which gave them a grant of land on which they founded the City of Hartford, Conn. in 1637. When this settlement was made, the name of Robert Bartlett appears as one of the original proprietors and he is known to have been a resident of the place until he moved to Northampton in 1655.<br>
<br>
There is a Monument in the center of Town commerating this.. Robert was an original proprietor of Hartford, CT. He received 8 Acres in the division 1632 - 1640. He lived on the West side of the highway which is now Layette Street.. (Families of Early Hartford, CT by Lucius Barnes Barbara)& (Families 1620 - 1700 Complied by Frank R. Holmes-Baltimore Genealogical Publishing Co.)<br>
<br>
Robert was declared a Freeman on 4/10/1645 - Freemen had the right of suffrage, enjoyed advantages in the division of land &, before the representative system started, freeman were members of thn General Court. The principal qualifications for this privilege seem to have been church membership.<br>
<br>
Fenwick, Mrs. Mary, was slandered by Bartlett, in 1646; for which he was<br>
ordered to stand in the Pillory during Lecture, whipt, fined £5 with six months imprisonment. This was not the day to speak evil of dignitaries.<br>
<br>
Freeman's Oath: Becoming a freeman in Puritan New England originally meant<br>
becoming a member in good standing of the local church -- in turn meaning that a man had to demonstrate persuasively that he was one of the "elect" (a Calvinist concept essentially meaning that he was predestined to go to Heaven).<br>
<br>
Then he was inducted as a freeman, meaning he could vote in town meetings and elections. The oath essentially was a swearing of allegiance to the colony.<br>
<br>
Remember, Mass Bay Colony (and to a lesser extent Conn Colony) were theocracies, except that clegymen generally did not hold civil offices. "The Freeman's Oath" was the first paper printed in New England. It was printed at Cambridge by Stephen Daye in 1639, upon a single sheet, in the form of a handbill and without date."<br>
<br>
"The Oath was in these words as established in 1634" in Massachusetts:<br>
<br>
" I, _____, being by God's providence, an Inhabitant and Freeman within the Jurisdiction of this Commonwealth: do freely acknowledge myself to be subject to the Government thereof: And therefore do here swear by the great and<br>
dreadful Name of the Ever-living God, that I will be true and faithful to the same, and will accordingly yield assistance and support thereunto, with my person and<br>
estate, as in equity I am bound! and will also truly endeavor to maintain and preserve all the liberties and privileges thereof, submitting myself to the wholesome Laws and Orders made and established by the same. And further that I will not plot or practice any evil against it, or consent to any that shall so do; but will timely discover and reveal the same to the lawful Authority now here established for the speedy preventing thereof.<br>
<br>
"Moreover, I do solemnly bind myself in the sight of God that when I shall be called to give my voyce touching any matter of this State in which Freemen are to deal, I will give my vote and suffrage as I shall judge in mine own conscience may best conduce to tend to the public weal of the body. So help me God in the Lord Jesus Christ."<br>
<br>
Dr. Prescott goes on: It is to be recollected that none but Freemen could vote<br>
at any election, or hold any office, not even that of a juryman. And none could be admitted a freeman unless he was a member of the church. Whenever any person, not a member, was tried for any crime or offence therefore, it was by both judge and jury belonging to the church and entertaining strong predjudices against him.<br>
<br>
"This," remarked Gov. Hutchinson, "was a most extraordinary order of law," and yet it was continued in force until the dissolution of the colonial governments.<br>
<br>
Rev. Jonathan Edwards of Northampton, Mass., was one of the first to discard the practice, which act was the cause of so much opposition that it eventually resulted in his dismission in 1750.<br>
<br>
The main attack by the Indians upon Northampton, came on (King Phillip's War) March 14, 1676 when the Indians assaulted three sides of the stockade at the same time in the early part of the day. Had it not been for the fact that the settlers had most valuable assistance from a company of troops then garrisoned within the town, it would have been completely destroyed and the settlers all massacred or some of them carried away into capacity among the Indians and their French allies in Canada. As it was the Indians broke the stockade near the home of Robert & Ann Bartlett and killed 5 men, but were finally driven out and retreated without further damage. Robert was Slain by the Indians, & was buried in the Public Highway very near the spot where he fell for the reason it was said that it was not thought safe to carry his body to the cemetery. He had an estate valued at 654 pounds or upward of $ 2000, which was a large estate for a farmer in those days.<br>
<br>
Since Robert was buried in the Public Highway where he died, then when the Highway "Bartlett Lane" was redone his body was moved to the back yard of his home.. Then when the street was widen the houses were moved a few feet back and it is presently believe that his old home is residing above where he is laid..<br>
<br>
As early as 1658, the town of Northampton, built a ferryboat for the use of its citizens and placed it in charge of Robert Bartlett. It was reached by a road across the meadows from the lower end or what is now Pleasant St., and presumably was located not far from the ferry at Hockanum. Since Hadley had not been settled, it probably was designed for transporting hay and other farm produce and not for passenger service.<br>

In the Hartford land inventory of February 1639 Robert held four parcels of land; three acres with dwelling house, yards and gardens, two roods of upland, three acres of upland and two acres of swamp on the east side of Great River. On May 18, 1655, Robert bought of William Bloomfield five acres of land.<br>
<br>
The Ship "Lyon"<br>
<br>
LYON. This ship was famous in the history of the early emigration to Massachusetts, and her Master was equally noted for his skillful seamanship and his sympathy with the policy of the Puritan leaders. In 1630, 1631, and 1632 she made four voyages hither in quick succession under his command with the regularity and safety of a ferry, and on one of them saved the new settlement from starvation and death by her timely arrival with provisions and anti - scorbutics. The official connection of the Lyon with the Winthrop Fleet is of the same character as related of the Mary and John, as both were doubtless approved by the Governor and Assistants. In his letter of March 28, 1630, to his wife, written from the Arbella, off the Isle of Wight, after noting the sailing of the Mary and John, Winthrop wrote: 'and the ship which goes from Bristowe (Bristol) carrieth about eighty persons', This was the Lyon and she probably sailed from that port to accommodate passengers living In the West Counties -- Lancashire, Cheshire, Warwick, Gloucestershire, and Somerset. That they were authorized to settle in the limits of the Bay Patent seems assured as there is no evidence to the contrary following their arrival. The date of her departure is not known (probably in March) but her arrival at Salem is reported `in the latter part of May' some time before the Arbella reached that port. The identity of this ship is not established as there were several of her name in existence at that period. In view of her valuable services to the Colony it is to be hoped that the necessary search may be made to fix her home port, previous history, tonnage, and ownership. Of Captain William Peirce, her Master, more particulars are known. He had sailed to Plymouth in 1623 as Master of the Anne of London, bringing the last lot of passengers to the Pilgrim settlement. He was then a resident of Ratcliffe, parish of Stepney, London, and at that date was about thirty-one years old. He made a voyage to Salem in 1629 as Master of the Mayflower (not the Pilgrim ship) and thereafter he was in constant traffic in passengers and merchandise across the Atlantic. He took up his residence in Boston in 1632 and was admitted freeman May I4, 1634. His wife, Bridget, joined the church February 2, 1632/3; perhaps a second wife, as a William Peirce, mariner of White chapel, was licensed in 1615 to marry Margaret Gibbs. White chapel and Stepney are adjoining parishes. He became a Town and Colony official and was engaged In coast wise shipping thereafter. He compiled an Almanac for New England which was the second issue in 1639 from the Daye press at Cambridge. In 1641 he was killed by the Spaniards while on a voyage to the island of New Providence, Bahamas Group, whither he was taking passengers for settlement.<br>
<br>
This was the last voyage of the Lyon. On the following November, while returning to England, it was wrecked on a shoal a few miles from the mouth of the Chesapeake River.<br>

Note:<br>
Dissent continued to plague Massachusetts and Connecticut authorities. In 1656 a party of dissatisfied Puritans left Connecticut to establish Northampton still further north of Springfield. The upper Connecticut Valley saw the settlement of Hadley (1661), Hatfield (1670), Deerfield (1670), Northfield (1673), and Greenfield (1686).<br>
<br>

Martha Johanna BARTZ
<p>
<a name ="I001369"><b>[I001369]</b></a><br />
Martha Johanna Bartz died on Feb. 17, at Dove Healthcare in Eau Claire, Wis., at the age of 92.<br>
Her victory service will be held at Messiah Lutheran Church, 2015 N. Hastings Way, Eau Claire, at 11 a.m. Saturday, Feb. 27, with visitation the hour before the service. Pastors Paul Tiefel and Bruce Naumann will officiate.<br>
Martha was born on Oct. 17, 1917, at home in rural Suring, Wis., the daughter of John H. and Susan (nee Hernlem) Bartz. Martha was baptized into the Christian faith on Oct. 28, 1917, by Pastor Andrew Plass of St. John Ev. Lutheran Church in Hayes, Wis. She was later confirmed in her Christian faith at St. John on April 26, 1931. Her confirmation verse was John 6:68-69. Martha attended Linzy Brook School and St. John Lutheran Grade School before spending her freshman high school year at Dr. Martin Luther College in New Ulm, Minn. The economics of the Depression required Martha to return home, and she was graduated from Suring Public High School on May 22, 1936.<br>
For a short time after her graduation, Martha worked in the kitchen of an orphanage near Chicago, but then she moved to Red Wing, Minn., to live near her maternal grandmother and work for her uncle and aunt at Quandtʼs Food Shoppe. After nearly 15 years, she left Quandtʼs to begin employment at the Carnegie-Lawther Public Library. Martha later entered the Red Wing Area Practical Nursing Program offered by St. Johnʼs Hospital and was graduated in 1966 as a Licensed Practical Nurse. She worked at St. Johnʼs Hospital until her retirement.<br>
After her retirement, Martha provided home health care for her landlady, Mrs. L.E. Claydon. In 1988, she moved to Eau Claire where she resided until her death.<br>
Martha enjoyed cooking, reading, and visiting with family and friends. She was soft-spoken, faithful, and caring in her relationships. She was a strong Christian and an active member of Our Redeemerʼs Lutheran Church in Red Wing and of Messiah Lutheran Church in Eau Claire. Perhaps because she did not have a husband and children of her own, there was extra room in Marthaʼs heart for her siblings, her nieces and nephew and their children, and her extended family. She was on hand to be a help and comfort at the time of her brother Conradʼs death as well as at the time of death of both her sisters. In many ways, she was a mother and grandmother to her nieces and nephew and their children. Martha will be remembered by her nephew and nieces and her other relatives and friends as a dear and gracious woman who lived her faith.<br>
Martha was preceded in death by parents, John and Susan Bartz; brothers, Conrad and Marcus; sisters, Irma and Eva; and two brothers who died shortly after birth.<br>
She is survived by nieces, Linda Alexander, Janet Pagels, Ruth Ahrens, Susan Lentz, and Beth Kranz; nephew, Paul Nolting; numerous cousins; and many friends.<br>
In lieu of flowers, memorials may be given for some aspect of the work of the Kingdom.<br>
Friends may offer condolences online at www.fullerspeckien.com. Fuller Speckien Hulke Funeral Home, 3209 Rudolph Road, Eau Claire, is assisting the family with the arrangements.<br>

Late in 1875, William and Johanna Bartz homesteaded a tract of land in Oconto County. In the spring<br>
of 1876, Johanna, carrying their infant son, Franc, and with Marie, their four year old daughter,<br>
trudging at her heels, walked some 25 miles along wilderness trails leading through the Indian<br>
Reservation to have the child baptized by Rev. Dicke. When Pastor Dicke heard that there were a few<br>
other Lutheran families near there, he said, "Now it is time that these people also have the word of<br>
God preached to them." <br>
