Boleslaw I Chrobry of POLAND
<p>
<a name ="I015218"><b>[I015218]</b></a><br />
Boleslaw I Chrobry ('Boleslaus the Brave') (966/967 - 1025) of the Piast family, son of Mieszko I and of his first wife, the Czech princess Dobrawa, ruled as duke of Poland from 992 to 1025 and reigned as King of Poland in 1025.<br>
<br>
Boleslaus's Career<br>
In 984 Boleslaus married Rikdaga, the daughter of Riddag (Rikdag, Ricdag), the margrave of Meissen. Subsequently he married Judith, the daughter of Geza the Great Prince of Hungary; then Enmilda, the daughter of one Dobromir, a Lusatian prince; and Oda, daughter of the margrave of Meissen. His wives bore him sons including Bezprym, Mieszko II and Otton; and a daughter, Mathilde. After death of his father around 992 he was able to expel the second wife of his father, Oda, with her sons, and unite the country again.<br>
<br>
In 997 Boleslaus sent Saint Adalbert of Prague to Prussia on the Baltic Sea to attempt to convert the Prussians to Christianity. By this time he already possessed Silesia and Pomerania (with its main city of Gdansk and Little Poland (with its main city of Cracow). In 999 he annexed present-day Moravia and in 1000 or 1001 Slovakia.<br>
<br>
In A.D. 1000, while on a pilgrimage to the tomb of St. Adalbert at Gniezno, the emperor Otto III invested Boleslaus with the title Frater et Cooperator Imperii ("Brother and Partner of the Empire"). Some historians say that the emperor also pledged the king's crown to Boleslaus. On the same visit Otto III accepted Gniezno's status as an archbishopric. For the consequences see the article on the meeting at the tomb of Saint Adalbert.<br>
<br>
After the untimely death of Otto III in 1002 at the age of 22, Boleslaus conquered Meissen and Lusatia, in an attempt to wrest imperial territory for himself during the disputes over the throne; he and his father had both backed Henry the Wrangler against Otto earlier, and he accepted the accession of Henry II of Germany, the earlier Henry's son.<br>
<br>
Boleslaus conquered and made himself duke of Bohemia and Moravia in 1003 - 1004; he defeated the Ruthenians and stormed Kyiv in 1018, annexing the Red Strongholds (Grody Czerwienskie) later called Red Ruthenia and making prince Sviatopolk his vassal there. The intermittent wars with Germany ended with the Peace of Bautzen, Budziszyn in 1018, which left Sorbian Meissen and Lusatia in Polish hands.<br>
<br>
The emperor Henry II obliged Boleslaus to give a pledge of allegiance again for the lands he held in fief. After the death of Henry in 1024, Boleslaus crowned himself king, raising Poland to the rank of kingdom (1025).<br>
<br>
The son of Boleslaus, Mieszko II crowned himself immediately after his father's death.<br>
<br>
Boleslaus sent an army to aid his friend, or more probably to his nephew, Canute in his conquest of England.<br>
<br>
Boleslaus was the first Polish King, since during his rule Poland became a Kingdom, despite the fact that some of the Polish rulers before 1295 never received a crown. He was the first Polish ruler baptised at birth, the first real Christian ruler. He founded the independent Polish province of the church and made Poland a strong power in Europe. Boleslaus for the first time unified all the provinces that subsequently came to comprise the traditional territory of Poland: Greater Poland, Little Poland, Masovia, Silesia and Pomerania. For the Sorbs of Lusatia he became the national hero.<br>

Boleslaw III of POLAND
<p>
<a name ="I007710"><b>[I007710]</b></a><br />
From Wikipedia<br>
<br>
Boleslaus III the Wrymouth (Boleslaw III Krzywousty), (1086-1138) was duke of Poland from 1102. He was a son of Ladislaus Herman of Poland and Judith of Bohemia, daughter of emperor Henry III. Boleslaus III was thus the brother in law of emperor Henry IV.<br>
<br>
He defeated the Pomeranians at the battle of Naklo in 1109, and took control of Pomerania between 1119 and 1123, once again by conquest regaining temporary Polish access to the Baltic Sea. The government of the local Pomeranians was left in place. He also defeated Henry V, Holy Roman Emperor in 1109, in the Battle of Hundsfeld. However in 1135 he became a vassal of Henry's son Lothair II, Holy Roman Emperor, from whom he received the lien of Pomerania, Poland and Ruegen.<br>
<br>
Boleslaus also campaigned in Hungary from 1132 to 1135, but to little effect.<br>
<br>
First he married Zbyslava of Kiev, daughter of Sviatopolk II of Kiev grand duke of Kiev. They had one son:<br>
    * Ladislaus (b. 1105), King of Poland<br>
<br>
Second he married Salome von Berg-Schelklingen, with whom he had 14 children (6 sons + 8 daughters) from whom we know of 4 sons and 5 daughters:<br>
    * Boleslaus IV the Curly (b. 1125)<br>
    * Mieszko III the Old (b. 1126)<br>
    * Henry of Sandomierz (b. 1127)<br>
    * Casimir the Just (b. 1138)<br>
    * Rycheza of Poland (b. 12 April 1116), married to grandduke Volodar<br>
    * Dobronega of Poland (b. 1128), married Markis Dietrich of Niederlausitz<br>
    * Gertruda of Poland<br>
    * Judith of Poland (b. 1132), married Otto I of Brandenburg<br>
    * Agnes of Poland (b. 1137), married Mstislav II of Kiev<br>
<br>
Before his death in 1138 he announced the testament (Boleslaw the Wrymouth's testament) dividing his land between four of his sons. The "senioral principle" established in the testament stated, that at every time the oldest member of the dynasty was to have a supreme power over the rest and also control an indivisible "senioral part" - a vast stripe of land running N-S through the middle of Poland, with Krakow as the main city. Senior's prerogatives included also control over Pomerania, which was a fief of the Empire. The principle was quickly broken, which began an almost 200 years period of feudal dissolution in Poland.<br>
</p>
Kazimierz I Karol of POLAND
<p>
<a name ="I007739"><b>[I007739]</b></a><br />
Casimir I, the Restorer (Polish: Kazimierz I Odnowiciel) (1015-1058), duke of Poland, was the son of Mieszko II of Poland and Rixa von Lothringen. Casimir married Dobronega (Maria) of Kyiv and they had two children: Boleslaus II, King of Poland and Ladislaus Herman, duke of Poland.<br>
<br>
In 1046 the emperor Henry held royal/imperial courts at Merseburg and Meissen, where he ended the strife between the Dux Bomeraniorum (Pomerania), the duke Bratislaw of Bohemia and Casimir I of Poland.<br>

</p>
Mieszko II Lambert of POLAND
<p>
<a name ="I015215"><b>[I015215]</b></a><br />
Mieszko II Lambert, also spelled as Miezko II, was the duke and short-term king of Poland (990 - 1034). He was the son of Boleslaw I Chrobry and Enmilda, the daughter of Dobromir Duke of Lusatia. Their children were Casimir I of Poland, Rixa of Poland, and Gertrude of Poland.<br>
<br>
Mieszko II was very well educated for the period. He was able to read and write, and knew both Greek and Latin. He is (unjustly) known as Mieszko Gnus'ny which means Lazy, Stagnant or Slothful. He received that name because of the most unfortunate end of his rule; but at the start, he acted as a skillful and talented ruler. Before he became king in 1025, he probably ruled as his father's governor in Kraków, most likely since 1013, when he supposedly built many churches.<br>
<br>
He waged war against Germany (starting in 1028), quite successfully: he was able to repel the German army, and later he even invaded Saxony. He allied with Hungary, resulting for a while in the Hungarian occupation of Vienna. This war probably was because of family connections of Mieszko in opposition against emperor Conrad II in Germany.<br>
<br>
To understand what happened later, it is necessary to understand Mieszko's family. His older brother, Bezprym, was the son of an unknown Hungarian wife of Boleslaw, who was later expelled by Boleslaw. He also had a younger brother, Otton. According to old Slavic custom, a father was supposed to divide his heritage between all his sons. However, since kingdoms can not be divided, Mieszko's brothers received nothing from their father's legacy. As Bezprym was the oldest son, many probably felt that he should have succeeded his father as king. However, Bezprym had always been disliked by his father, as denoted by his name (Piasts usually used names like Boleslaw, Mieszko, later also Kazimierz, Wladyslaw, or Emperor's names: Otton, Conrad, Heinrich: but Bezprym was a commoner's name, which implied that Boleslaw did not desire Bezprym to follow him in succession). He was sent to a monastery.<br>
<br>
Both Mieszko's brothers escaped abroad: Otton to Germany, Bezprym to Kievan Rus. Soon after both the German emperor and the great duke of Kyiv, Yaroslav I the Wise, allied and made simultaneous invasions.<br>
<br>
Facing two enemies, Germany from the west and Ruthenia from the east, Mieszko escaped to Bohemia where he was probably castrated. Bezprym started his rule by sending his crown and other king's insignia to Germany. Mieszko returned soon, but this time he was forced to pledge allegiance to the German Emperor, and Poland was divided between him, his brothers Otton and Bezprym, and a mysterious Thiedric (probably nephew or cousin). Otton was killed by one of his own men, and Mieszko was able to reunite Poland. What happened next is a great puzzle. Today modern historians think that Mieszko was killed in a plot organised by the aristocracy (1034).<br>
<br>
After his death, the peasants revolted in the pagan reaction. The exact reasons and date are unknown. Casimir I of Poland, son of Mieszko, was either expelled by this uprising, or the uprising was caused by expelling by aristocracy. Modern historians argue that it was more probably caused by economical issues (huge new taxes for the Church, militarisation of early Polish dukedom/kingdom: almost all the male population were drafted to serve in the army etc.) than religious. Priests, monks and knights were killed; cities, churches and monasteries were burned. The chaos was even greater when the Czechs invaded unexpectedly from the south. The land became divided between local rulers, of whom one is known (Maslav, who ruled Mazovia). Greater Poland was so devastated that it ceased to be the core of the Polish kingdom. New Polish kings moved their capital to Little Poland, to Kraków.<br>
</p>
Richeza of POLAND
<p>
<a name ="I007701"><b>[I007701]</b></a><br />
When Alfonso died in 1157, Richeza remarried to Ramon Berenguer II, Count of Provence, in 1162. Their daughter was Douce (died 1172). Ramon Berenguer died in 1166, and she remarried once more to Count Raymond V of Toulouse.<br>
</p>
Vladislaus II of POLAND
<p>
<a name ="I007708"><b>[I007708]</b></a><br />
Wladislaus II the Exile (Polish: W?adys?aw II Wygnaniec, also seen Wladislaus, Ladislaus, Ladislas or Vladislav) was the High-Duke of Poland (1138-1146)<br>
<br>
After his father's death, Wladislaus, as his oldest son, became the High-Duke of Poland. He controlled the high-duke province of Kraków and Gniezno and also his hereditary province of Silesia.<br>
<br>
In 1146 he was driven into exile by his younger brothers and died in Germany. In 1163 the province of Silesia was granted to his sons by the Polish duke Boleslaus Kedzierzawy. Subsequenly Silesia was divided among his descendants and successors (going up to 17 duchies), until they died out in 1675.<br>
</p>
Wladislaw I Herman of POLAND
<p>
<a name ="I007737"><b>[I007737]</b></a><br />
Wladislaus I Herman (Polish W?adys?aw I Herman, also seen as Ladislaus, Ladislas or Vladislav) (1040-1102), duke of Poland, was the son of Casimir I of Poland, duke of Poland. He was the brother of Boleslaus II, the Bold, King of Poland.<br>
<br>
He took the Polish throne in 1079 when Boleslaus II died, but resigned the royal title and supported Henry IV in a bid to restore peace.<br>
<br>
Wladislaus Herman was first married to Judith of Bohemia, then to Judith of Swabia, the daughter of Henry III, Holy Roman Emperor.<br>
<br>
Wladislaus and Judith of Swabia had a daughter named Agnes of Gandersheim.<br>

</p>
Rogneda of POLOTSK
<p>
<a name ="I005542"><b>[I005542]</b></a><br />
Rogneda of Polotsk (962-1002) is the Slavic name for Ragnhild, whose father Ragnvald (Slavic: Rogvolod) came from overseas (i.e., from Scandinavia) and established himself at Polotsk in the mid-10th century.<br>
<br>
It has been speculated that Ragnvald belonged to the Ynglings royal family of Norway. In or about 980, Vladimir of Novgorod, on learning that she was betrothed to his brother Yaropolk I of Kiev, took Polotsk and forced Rogneda to marry him. Having raped Rogneda in the presence of her parents, he ordered them to be killed, along with two of Rogneda's brothers.<br>
<br>
Rogneda gave him several children. The four sons were Yaroslav the Wise, Vsevolod, Mstislav, and Izyaslav. She also bore two daughters, one of whom is named by Nestor the Chronicler as Predslava (taken as a concubine of Boleslaus I of Poland, according to Gallus). A later chronicle tells a story, most likely taken from a Norse saga, of Rogneda plotting against Vladimir and asking her elder son, Izyaslav, to kill him. As was the Norse royal custom, she was sent with her elder son to govern the land of her parents, i.e. Polotsk. Izyaslav's line continued to rule Polotsk and the newly-found town of Izyaslavl until the Mongol invasion.<br>
<br>
There is another legend, that she became a nun and took the name Anastasia.<br>
