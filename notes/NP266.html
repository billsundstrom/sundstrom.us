THIRTEEN" NO HURT TO 55 HAPPY WEDDED YEARS <br>
    Mr. and Mrs. E.A. Hutchinson, Commercial Street, celebrated their fifty-fifth wedding anniversary on Saturday, December 13, when they were at home to a number of callers and received many cards and messages of congratulation. Mrs. Hutchinson, whose birthday is also on the thirteenth of another month, says she has no superstition about the thirteenth, as no bad luck has attended them. They were married at the home of her parents, Mr. and Mrs. James H. Barteaux, Morristown, in the evening of December 13, 1892, by Rev. James Bancroft, who was the pastor of the Baptist Church at Aylesford and Morristown. The bride, Miss Armina Ethel Barteaux, was dressed in grey with brown trimmings. There was a very large wedding and of those who attended, three sisters of Mrs. Hutchinson are still living - Mrs. Margaret Easson and Mrs. Winnifred Rainforth, Morristown, and her twin sister, Mrs. Ross McNeill, Factorydale. The bride and groom spent several days in Morristown, and then went to South Framingham, Mass., where they lived for six years, afterward returning to Morristown, where Mr. Hutchinson farmed for years, retiring twelve years ago and coming to Berwick to reside. One daughter, Miss Gladys Hutchinson, resides with them, and another daughter, Mrs. Hector Dunlop, and two grandchildren live in Liverpool, N. S.<br>

Guy Harris HUTT
<p>
<a name ="I036088"><b>[I036088]</b></a><br />
Guy came to Massachusetts from Nova Scotia about 1925. The depression had hit Nova Scotia earlier and harder than New England so he sought work. In Nova Scotia he had worked on his father's farm as well as working as a cooper and lumberjack. He settled in Westborough where others he knew from home had settled. He found work as a coal truck driver. In those days he had to first load the truck by hand and then offload it by hand at people's homes. Later, when oil became the heating fuel of choice, he drove an oil truck. No doubt it was easier than a coal truck but still required deliveries to be made in all sorts of weather.<br>
He used to tell us that when he decided to go to Massachusetts, he was involved with a young lady. Once he found work, he was to send for her and they would be married. In 1926 he married Irene Evelyn Thorpe whom he had known in Nova Scotia. She was not, however, the girl that he had left waiting. He always chuckled when he said he never knew what happened to her. We suspect his motives for leaving Nova Scotia went beyond looking for work!<br>
