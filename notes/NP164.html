She was born on September 6, 1922, the second of four sisters, to Elizabeth and Maurice Emery in Warren, Pennsylvania. After meeting her husband, Bob, in college, they were married on August 22, 1944, having dated only each other. She went on to earn her master's degree in English literature from Boston University. Following short stints in Missouri and Kansas, the couple came to live in Dallas in 1953. It was there that she and Bob raised their two sons and served in long and fruitful church ministry. Lois' calling was as a piano teacher, and she taught for 71 of her 91 years. Dozens of her students went on to become teachers and performers themselves - her impact on her students was truly inspirational. She was fond of quoting Henry Adams, who said, "A teacher affects eternity; [she] can never tell where [her] influence stops." She is survived by her three sisters; two sons, Stephen (Carolyne) Nielson and Niel (Kathleen) Nielson; five grandchildren (Jon, Dan, David, Christiana and Caroline); and three great-grandchildren.

ONALASKA - Donald Richard Ender of Onalaska passed peacefully Jan. 29, 2012, at the age of 83.<br>
He was born on Dec. 22, 1928, in West Salem to Martin and Helen Ender . He married Elizabeth (Betty) Hayes in March of 1957 and lived an extraordinary life with a devoted family of five children, six grandchildren and a growing number of great-grandchildren. Donald lived under the credo "God first, family second and all else third."<br>
Service was at the heart of his life. A 20-plus year veteran of the United States Air Force, he traveled the world, from Newfoundland to England to Italy to Vietnam, often with his family by his side, before retiring from the military to work at Gundersen Lutheran Medical Center. Donald was passionate about music and athletics. He played clarinet in high school and went on to win several singing competitions, sang in the choir at St. Patrick's parish, coached little league, volunteered for softball leagues, and was an avid supporter of his favorite teams.<br>
His greatest service was to his wife Betty, children Beverly, Donald , Gloria, Denise and John, along with grandchildren Chris, David, Michael, Jennah, Claire and Ava, as well as his great grandchild Ethan. He was a dedicated family man who made each of us feel treasured and loved. He was preceded in death by his sister, Betty Thurston.<br>
Donald talked daily with a vast network of family and friends, who supported him throughout his life. His family would like to thank Kent Davis; La Crosse Home Health Care, especially Pollie Banashak, Julie Dietz, Brenda Elliott, Karen Havey, and Dan Kaminski; Gundersen Lutheran Hospital Palliative Care, especially Gerilynn Brasic and Marsha Kendall; and the Zablocki VA Hospital Spinal Cord Unit for all the great care they gave him.<br>
Donald 's last wish was to live out his final days at home with his wife Betty, who selflessly provided compassion and care for him, granted his final wish and shared with him one of the greatest love stories ever witnessed. It was a privilege and blessing the world was graced with the life of Donald Ender .<br>
A Mass of Christian burial will be held at 10:30 a.m. on Friday at St. Patrick's Catholic Church, Onalaska. The Rev. Steven Kachel will officiate.
