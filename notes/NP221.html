<p>

HAMILTON--Frederic C.<br>
<br>
(September 25, 1927-September 30, 2016) Died peacefully after a brief illness in Denver, Colorado. He was born in Columbus, Ohio and spent much of his childhood in Springfield, Illinois. He attended Millbrook and Lawrenceville Schools in high school and Babson College. Fred served in the U.S. Air Force. With a $5,000 loan from their mother, the Hamilton brothers became some of the most successful wildcatters in the emerging oil and gas business, with a presence in many major fields and an enormous success in Canada as well as the British part of the North Sea. Fred's hope for his legacy, to quote a recent article was "I'd like people to remember me as hard working and that I worked all my life. I'd like to be known as someone with integrity. That I had understanding and sensitivity to people. And as someone cognizant that you have to give back to the system when you've been successful. You can't just take. You have to give back." Hamilton Brothers became one of the most successful small oil and gas companies and was ultimately sold to BHP in early 1990 with a spin-off company, Tejas Gas sold to Shell Corporation shortly thereafter. Fred continued to invest in business his entire life, creating an investment office called The Hamilton Companies in the 1990's that invest in all forms of private equity and alternative investments as well as in operating companies and in real estate. Over time, he devoted an increasing amount of time to philanthropy. One of his greatest contributions to the Denver community was encouraging institutions to create independent foundations that would provide support to charities far into the future. He gave generously of time and money to the Denver Art Museum, including an art bequest of significance to the Museum's Impressionist collection. He also served on the Council of the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C. He supported many local schools, including Graland Country Day School and Denver University where his wife Jane was a longstanding Trustee. He also supported St. Paul's School as well as Millbrook School, New York, and Babson College's Entrepreneurial Program. Fred gave generously to the medical community including Children's Hospital and a variety of research programs at Colorado University/Anschutz Hospital in Denver, including macular degeneration and endocrinology. Earlier Fred endowed a Chair in Cardiology at Weill Cornell Medical College in New York. Fred was an avid sportsman; he liked to fish and to hunt birds in particular. He enjoyed golf his entire life, belonging to many of the most illustrious and challenging golf institutions in America. Fred leaves Jane, his wife of 64 years and his four children, Christy H. McGraw (Ted), Fred, Jr. (Emory), Crawford (Sue) and Tom (Eugenie) as well as ten grandchildren. Service is at The Denver Art Museum at 5pm October 6, 2016. Memorial donations may be made to The Denver Art Museum Foundation or Ducks Unlimited.<br>

Athens Daily Review, 11 October 2010<br>
--------------------------------------------------------------<br>
Dr. George F. Hamm, President Emeritus of The University of Texas at Tyler, died Sunday. Hamm, 79, served as president of the University from 1981 to 1998, leading it through an era of dynamic expansion and broadening its commitment to intellectual development, academic excellence and community service.<br>
A Requiem Mass is scheduled for Thursday, October 14, 2010 at 11:00 AM at the Cathedral of the Immaculate Conception in Tyler with Monsignor Joe Strickland, Father Gus Tharappel, and Father Anthony McLaughlin officiating.

Hamm's death followed a lengthy illness. He was born June 26, 1931 in Rapid City, South Dakota, son of Michael and Mae (Howard) Hamm.<br>
In honor of his contributions to the development of UT Tyler, the UT System Board of Regents conferred on him the title of President Emeritus in 2003, stating: "One of Dr. Hamm's most significant accomplishments was his leadership in working with the legislature and other community leaders in elevating UT Tyler to four-year status in 1997."<br>
When he announced plans for retirement, Hamm described his years at UT Tyler "as the best and happiest years of my professional life," and stated, "With each succeeding year, Janie and I have accumulated greater numbers of friends and more enduring relations. The university has grown significantly in stature because of its ever increasing numbers of generous benefactors."<br>
Hamm was responsible for raising private gifts to supplement university funds for construction of the R. Don Cowan Center Fine and Performing Arts Center at UT Tyler. He established the university's Distinguished Lecture Series, which has featured such speakers as Henry Kissinger, Coretta Scott King and William F. Buckley.<br>
During his presidency, Hamm secured approval for establishment of the college of engineering, the first at a state university in East Texas. He worked to create UT Tyler's campuses in Longview and Palestine. New degree programs included master's degrees in nursing, history, mathematics, biology and political science. His commitment to building and retaining faculty excellence brought scholars from leading universities around the nation to UT Tyler.<br>
Hamm's leadership also led to construction of UT Tyler's first on-campus student housing, the University Pines complex. The complex was one of the first in Texas to be built entirely with private funds.<br>
In recognition of his commitment to academic excellence, friends of the university established the $500,000 George F. Hamm Endowed Chair in Arts and Humanities to advance awareness of ethical principles, social responsibilities, appreciation of the arts, and a respect for the dignity and uniquenesses of others. In addition, Hamm created numerous endowed presidential scholarships during his presidency.<br>
One of Hamm's ongoing priorities was expanding global educational opportunities and pursuing international relationships for the city of Tyler and the university. He cultivated exchange programs with universities in France, Japan, Germany, Poland and Mexico. <br>
The Tyler Sister Cities Program began in 1982 in large part because of his leadership and energy. Tyler's current sister city relationships established with his support and encouragement include Yachiyo City, Japan and Jelenia Gora, Poland. <br>
He established the Eisenhower International Golf Classic in 1987 to benefit international scholarship programs. This event, which was continued for 13 years, brought to East Texas such stars as Phil Mickelson, Greg Norman, Payne Stewart, Fred Couples, Annika Sorenstam and Chi Chi Rodriguez.<br>
At the national and international level, Dr. Hamm served for many years on the board of directors of Sister Cities International. At the time of his death he was a member of the board of the U.S.-Ukraine Foundation. <br>
Hamm was a graduate of South Dakota State University, where he attended on a football scholarship. He served in Uijeongbu as an officer in the U.S. Army 32nd Infantry Regiment during the Korean War. After the war he earned a doctorate in experimental psychology from the University of Wyoming. <br>
His career in higher education administration and teaching begin in 1962 when he was named dean of students at Arizona State University. He went on to become vice president of student affairs, the position he held when he was named president of UT Tyler. Arizona State honored Hamm in 1986 with its University Centennial Medallion as a "Man Ahead of His Times", for providing equal educational opportunities for minorities." <br>
U.S. Rep. Ralph Hall sponsored a congressional resolution commending Hamm in 1998 for his "unmatched leadership and vision to the university." The resolution stated, "As president of UT Tyler, Dr. Hamm dedicated his intellect, talents and energy to build a first-rate educational institution in East Texas. His goals were for many years elusive dreams, but thanks to his vision, perseverance and leadership, these dreams have become reality."<br>
Locally, Hamm served on the boards of numerous organizations including the Tyler Economic Development Council, Tyler Area Chamber of Commerce, United Way of Greater Tyler and St. Edward's University in Austin.<br>
Texas College awarded him an honorary doctorate of humane letters in 1997 for his enduring efforts with the Texas College/United Negro College Fund.<br>
He was preceded in death by two sons, Robert Joseph Hamm and Daniel George Hamm; by brothers John, Joseph, Philip, William, Michael and James; and, by sisters Margaret, Mary and Ann. <br>
