Llewelyn ap SEISYLL
<p>
<a name ="I004622"><b>[I004622]</b></a><br />
From Wikipedia, 12 June 2006:<br>
<br>
Llywelyn ap Seisyll (died 1023) was a King of Gwynedd and of Deheubarth in north-west and south-west Wales.<br>
<br>
Little is known about Llywelyn's father Seisyll, who may not have been of royal blood, though Llywelyn's mother Angharad was the daughter of Maredydd ab Owain, who ruled much of both northern and southern Wales for a period.<br>
<br>
Llywelyn won control of Gwynedd in 1018 when he defeated Aeddan ap Blegywryd in battle, killing him and his four sons. He later gained control of Deheubarth, defeating Rhain, an Irish pretender who claimed to be the son of Maredydd ab Owain, at Abergwili in 1022. According to the annals in Brut y Tywysogion, Llywelyn's reign was a period of prosperity, "there was no one needy in his realm, and there was no town empty or deserted". His reign was cut short by his premature death in 1023.<br>
<br>
His son, Gruffydd ap Llywelyn, though still a youth when his father died, was later able to gain control of almost the whole of Wales.<br>
