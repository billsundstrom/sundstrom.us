Mary Elvina FORSBERG
<p>
<a name ="I000800"><b>[I000800]</b></a><br />
Mary E. Knight - a divorced woman - possibly died 19 Jan 1970 in Toledo, Lucas, OH.<br>
Also it is possible that she either died or divorced Charles Knight before 1940. This is based on the 1940 census listing of his wife being Myrle E. Knight (age 38) born in Michigan.  Because Edythe is not living with Charles, then divorce is more likely. <br>

<p>
<a name ="I006302"><b>[I006302]</b></a><br />
POCASSET - Charlie was born in 1930 to parents Charles Marshall Fosgate Sr. and Edna Steele Fosgate in Cambridge. He passed away November 15, 2010, following a long illness. Charlie was a native son, grandson and great-grandson of Cambridge, educated in Cambridge schools and a Harvard Graduate, class of 1951. His major work life was devoted to management in the field of technical sales of chemicals for coated fabrics. In later years Charlie left industry to start his own business. In 1985 he founded a retail store of gifts and all things photographic called Picture This in Sandwich and Pocasset. He always prided himself on being on the cutting edge and indeed was in photographic developments. People remember his radio ads starting with, "Hi, this is Charlie at Picture This."<br>
Before moving to their summer home in Pocasset, the family lived in Sudbury for 27 years. There he initiated a community project which began as a mission for the Memorial Congregational Church of a training program for CPR. He trained instructors as well as taught CPR in private, civic and commercial establishments. In Pocasset he expressed his civic concern by working to reopen the Pocasset Fire House, so vital in this community.<br>
Charlie's first love besides his family and community was boating and sailing. He grew up in the summers on wonderful Old Silver Beach and often said the first 17 summers of his life were happy there. Boating started very early with sailing off the beach and then more formally out of West Falmouth Harbor. Buzzards Bay was his playground and as the years went by he sailed all manner of boats from a beautiful old cutter to a Hobie Cat up and down the bay and enjoyed the beauties of Quissett and Hadley's Harbors and the Elizabeth, Martha's Vineyard and Nantucket Islands. Later there were many trips to the Caribbean on small boat cruises and sailing on chartered boats. His other love was skiing and he enjoyed the major ski slopes in New England including climbing into Tuckerman's Ravine for summer skiing. Later he discovered the thrills of western skiing in Aspen. He enjoyed it all over again when skiing with his children.<br>
Charlie hated gush and superficial enthusiasm. He believed in calling a fact a fact, and dealing with it in a realistic way. He always preferred to stay on the high road of common sense. People who did not know him well sometimes thought his manner was a bit brusque; however, when they knew him better, they grew to appreciate the kindness of his heart, his quiet helpfulness to others. He was a true friend and a devoted family man.<br>
He is much loved by his family, his wife of 55 years, Florence Potter Fosgate, daughter Sandy Fosgate Clark and her husband Louis Clark and children Emily and Louie of Plymouth, as well as son Charles Hastings Fosgate and wife Michelle and sons Andrew and Kevin of Frederick, Md. He is also survived by sister Phyllis Black and her husband Delbert Black of Pocasset and North Carolina and sister Claire Kehn of Granby, Conn., and many nieces and nephews. Remembered by dear friends of the North Falmouth Congregational Church.<br>
A memorial service for Charlie will be held at the North Falmouth Congregational Church, 155 Old Main Road, North Falmouth at 2 p.m., Saturday, November 20, 2010. Remembrances in his name may be made to Cape Cod Health Care Foundation, Box 370, Hyannis, MA 02601 or North Falmouth Congregational Church, P.O. Box 403, North Falmouth, MA 02556.<br>

Phyllis Elizabeth FOSGATE
<p>
<a name ="I038250"><b>[I038250]</b></a><br />
POCASSET - Phyllis was born to parents Charles Marshall Fosgate Sr. and Edna Steele Fosgate in Cambridge. She passed away peacefully Friday, November 19, 2010, at her daughter's home in Charlotte, North Carolina. She was 88 and a native daughter and great-granddaughter of Cambridge. Educated at Cambridge Latin and a graduate of Tufts University, She worked one year for the president of Tufts University before marrying her husband, Delbert Raymond Black of Newton. After the war, they settled in Lexington, where they raised three children. Phyllis volunteered in her children's schools, as well as the Hancock Church, participating in many charities. Later, she worked at Lexington High School as a secretary for many years. Phyllis was an excellent seamstress and knitter. She made many of her own clothes as well as her daughter's and knit many of her grandchildren's sweaters. After living 44 years in Lexington, while summering on Wings Neck, Phyllis and her husband renovated their cottage and retired to Pocasset.<br>
Phyllis loved the ocean and Cape Cod. In her early years, a summer cottage was built on Wings Neck. Swimming, boating, sailing and fishing were the summer rituals. There was always a boat named the Blackmagic and a lifetime of boat trips around Buzzards Bay to the Elizabeth Islands, Martha's Vineyard and Nantucket. With family and friends, they would often venture to the many beautiful harbors, coves and inner ponds that encompass these areas.<br>
Phyllis would often reminisce wonderful stories about her childhood summers at Old Silver Beach. There were summer pranks and all kinds of activities that went on among her beloved friends. Once she saw the promising young actor Henry Fonda, from the Playhouse, now the Sea Crest, swimming at the raft. The family would go to see the New York boat and wave to relatives as it passed through the narrow waters in the old Cape Cod Canal. There were stories about daily walks to the West Falmouth post office to pick up mail, a lengthy walk by today's standards. She felt the presence of youth of eternal summers in those Old Silver Beach stories.<br>
After retiring to the Cape, there were many off-season trips Down Maine to Florida and North Carolina to visit with her daughter and grandchildren. She also discovered that winters on the Cape with the ocean storms and animal life could be just as interesting as the summer.<br>
She is survived and dearly missed by her loving husband Delbert R. Black; her sister Claire Kehn; her three children, Charles Black, Richard Black and Diane Ducey; and her four grandchildren, Erin Stackhouse, Tim Ducey, Jennifer Ducey and Megan Ducey.<br>
A service will be held at Chapman, Cole & Gleason Funeral Home, at 584 West Falmouth Hwy. (Route 28A), West Falmouth, MA, on Saturday, December 4, 2010, at 11 a.m. For those who are interested, memorials may be offered to Hospice and Palliative Care, Charlotte Region, 1420 East 7th Street, Charlotte, NC 28204-2408.<br>
