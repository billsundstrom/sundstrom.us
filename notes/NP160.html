Marguerite EDSON
<p>
<a name ="I061355"><b>[I061355]</b></a><br />
Marguerite Ninneman passed away peacefully, Sunday, June 16, 2002 at Belmont Terrace Nursing Home.  She was born to Otto and Eva (Pitts) Edson in Bremerton on January 16, 1913.<br>
Marguerite lived most of her 89 years in the Bremerton area.  She, her sister Dorothy and their brother Don attended local schools and graduated from Bremerton High School.<br>
After her parents divorced, she set aside her dream of becoming a teacher to answer a newspaper advertisement for ''petite blond ladies'' and became one of the original usherettes at the brand new Roxy Theater to provide much needed depression era income to her family.<br>
Marguerite and the dashingly handsome Ken Ninneman were married in 1935 and later moved to East Bremerton to raise their three children.  After years of summer rentals, Marguerite's passion for Hood Canal prompted the family's move to the South Shore where she became an active participant in PTA, a member and President of the School Board, and a prime mover behind the effort to create a high school for the ''Belfair kids''.<br>
Widowed after 58 years of marriage, she enjoyed family outings, duplicate bridge games, and lunch at the Boat Shed until declining health limited her mobility.<br>
She is survived and will be lovingly missed by her children: Jeanne (Ninneman) and her husband Dick Burger, Nancy Mosely and Don Ninneman and his wife Bonnie; her five granchildren and eight great-grandchildren.<br>
For those desiring to remember Marguerite through gifts, the family suggests Unity Church of Bremerton, 1712 Trenton, Bremerton, WA.  Private family services are pending.<br>
