----------------------------------------------------------<br>
Ardith L. Horak passed away on Dec. 8, 2007. She traveled from Iowa by train with her family to the northwest while in her teens, where she met and married her first husband Nate Sherman. Having lived in various places throughout the west she and Nate finally settled in Moses Lake. Ardith was a homemaker, helped Nate in his various businesses and took on many varied lines of work herself including driving a school bus and helping in their construction business. Nate preceded Ardy in death in 1960. <br>
Ardith then married Frank Horak . Frank worked in construction and they made their home in various cities throughout Washington following Frank's work. They made their final home in Moses Lake in the home they built themselves. <br>
Ardith was a woman who was "life" itself. She touched so many people's lives in so many ways. She was a vivacious, easy-to-laugh, very caring person. She was someone who truly loved life, loved living and lived every moment to the fullest. Life to her was an adventure to be discovered every day and at every turn. She had a love of learning and was a very self-taught person in many areas. Not to be outdone by Nate's ability to fly, she earned her own private pilots' license, seaplane license and flew solo cross-country in a flying race taking second place. She had a marvelous way of growing flowers, a love of cooking and still rode behind Frank on his 750 Honda motorcycle when she was in her 80s! She absolutely loved to travel and was always ready to go at a moment's notice. <br>
Ardith will continue to live in the memory of her three children, Barbara Williams and husband Frank, Jerry Sherman and wife Patricia, Toni Sherman; six grandchildren, 10 great-grandchildren and many friends. <br>
To honor the memory of Ardith 's life, the family will hold a gathering in the spring when it is easier for everyone to meet and share memories with each other. We will let the Immanuel Lutheran Church know in advance of the gathering. <br>
