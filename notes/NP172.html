Joseph Francis FARLEY
<p>
<a name ="I071799"><b>[I071799]</b></a><br />
JJoseph Francis Farley was born in Oxford, Ohio, on 22 June 1889. The son of Joseph Francis and Sarah Foot Farley, he attended Trumansburg High School, Trumansburg, NY and was graduated from Ithaca High School, Ithaca, NY in 1908. He was appointed a cadet at the Revenue Cutter School of Instruction on 10 May 1909 and he received his commission as a Third Lieutenant in the Revenue Cutter Service on 10 June 1912.<br>
His first assignment was on USCGC Mohawk. He served on board until June 1913. Afterward he was assigned to USCGC Seminole on neutrality patrol in the Caribbean. From July to October 1916, he was on USCGC Onondaga and then was assigned to USCGC Yamacraw from October 1916 to March 1919. When the United States entered World War I, Yamacraw was attached to the Patrol Force of the US Fleet. Later it moved to Gibraltar and served on escort and convoy duty in the Mediterranean and between Gibraltar and the ports of Great Britain. For his service during World War I, he received the Victory Medal with Escort Clasp and the New York State Medal.<br>
After leaving Yamacraw, he was assigned as accounting officer to the New York Division until January 1920. At this time he was attached to the Eagle boat, USCGC Scally. From September 1920 to December 1921, he served on the derelict  destroyer USCGC Seneca. His next assignment was on USCGC Gresham from which he was detached in June 1922 to serve on  SCGC Morrill. Afterward he  joined USCGC Mojave at Honolulu, TH. He served on board this ship until February 1925, when he was assigned to Washington, DC at Coast Guard  Headquarters. He served as Ordnance Officer for three years.<br>
He next served with the Destroyer Force that the Coast Guard operated on the Atlantic and Gulf coasts in suppression of smuggling during the "Rum War" era. Initially assigned to command USCGD McCall in March 1928, he was immediately reassigned to command USCGD Wilkes. During his command Wilkes attained the highest score in the Destroyer Force annual target practice during the gunnery year 1928-29. In September 1930 he was assigned the duties of Ordnance Officer for the Destroyer Force. He later assumed the additional duties of Athletic Officer and Service Store Officer for the Destroyer Force. From January 1933 to July 1934, he was commanding officer USCGC Pontchartrain and then was placed in command of USCGC Modoc.<br>
Returning to Coast Guard Headquarters in March 1937, he served as Chief Communications Officer until June 1942. During this time he was technical assistant to the United States delegation to the International Telecommunications  Conference at Cairo, Egypt in February-March 1938 and served as the only United States representative at the European Broadcasting Conference at Montreux, Switzerland during March 1939. He also served as a delegate to the International Subcommittee of the Third World Conference of Radiotelegraph Experts for Aeronautics at Cracow, Poland in May 1939. While at Headquarters he was also a member of the Coordinating Committee of the Defense Communications Board and also served as an alternate member of the Board.<br>
In June 1942 he became District Coast Guard Officer of the Eighth Naval District, New Orleans, LA. For his service during this time, he earned the Legion of Merit. Returning to Coast Guard Headquarters in December 1943, he served as Assistant Chief Operations Officer until December 1944 when he was appointed Chief Personnel Officer. He was appointed Commandant, succeeding Admiral Russell R. Waesche on 1 January 1946 with the rank of full Admiral for a term of four years. <br>
After receiving a commission as a Third Lieutenant on 10 June 1912, he was  promoted in rank as follows: Second Lieutenant, 31 May 1917; LT, 12 January 1923; LCDR, 1 July 1926, CDR, 27 June 1931; CAPT, 1 December 1941; COMM, 1 June 1943; RADM, 1 November 1943; ADM, 1 January 1946. <br>
Admiral Farleyʼs tenure as Commandant in the post-World War II era was trying and full of turmoil. Though known throughout the Coast Guard, as the pipe-smoking "Uncle Joe" (a nickname earned as a serious-minded cadet in the Revenue Cutter Serviceʼs School of Instruction), Farley did not attain a great popularity either within the service or without. This was true, in spite of the fact that he always had a good ear for the servicemenʼs problems. Farleyʼs orderly demobilization and reorganization after the war, however, indicated that he was a leader of more than moderate ability. During his tenure the Coast Guardʼs responsibility for the duties of the Bureau of Marine Inspection and Navigation, LORAN, the ocean stations were clarified and the personnel problems and statutory definition of its many  missions were resolved. Despite having a rough time of it, Farley had demonstrated that Admiral Waescheʼs faith in him had been justified.<br>
After a total of 42 years of service in the Coast Guard, Farley stepped down as Commandant on 31 December 1949 and retired effective 1 January 1950. Admiral Farley died on 25 November 1974 after a lengthy battle with throat cancer. He was laid to rest in Arlington National Cemetery.  His wife, Routh Bridgers Farley (December 25, 1893-June 2, 1990) is buried with him in Section 4.<br>

While still in high school, he played the clarinet for the San Francisco Symphony Orchestra and the World Wide Opera Company. At Cal, he played basketball and standing 6'8", was known on the west coast as "The Big Bear". He was commissioned in the U.S. Army in the spring of 1942 and served as Captain in the 212 Anti-Aircraft Group.

After his military service, he returned to Cal, graduating in 1947 and began a career in engineering in the forest products business in San Francisco. In 1960, he changed careers and spent the remainder of his life in Trust and Investment Management work, eventually retiring from Crocker Bank in 1985. He then started his own business which he continued until his death. He was preceded in death by Barbara, his wife of 62 years; and is survived by his son, William F. Farley II (Kathleen) of Minneapolis, Minn.; his daughter, Laurie VanderBeek (Robert) of Bend, Ore.; four grandchildren; eight great-grandchildren; and one great-great-grandchild.

Marjorie Carol FARNSWORTH
<p>
<a name ="I047829"><b>[I047829]</b></a><br />
Marjorie Carol Tolerton was born Feb. 13, 1934, in Los Angeles, Calif., to Helen and Maynard Farnsworth. Marjorie, who preferred to be called Carol, suffered from Parkinson's disease for many years. The Lord called her home Wednesday, Aug. 30, 2006.<br>
Despite her illness, Carol showed her delight for life and her selfless devotion to others until her death. Carol's great passions were her family, her friends and nature. Carol had an amazing ability to notice and appreciate each new bird, sunset or flower. Perhaps a gift from her mother who was a teacher, Carol had a young mind always eager to learn something new or try a new experience. She was a natural teacher for her children and grandchildren, always pointing out a beautiful sunflower, interesting bug or strange plant. She shared her love for gardening and camping with both her parents and her children.<br>
Her mother Helen Day Anstess, a brilliant UCLA graduate, and her father Maynard Farnsworth, a firefighter and amateur astronomer, preceded her in death. Her two adventurous brothers, Dick and Bob Farnsworth, with whom she enjoyed waterskiing, snow skiing, scuba diving, camping and vacationing, survive her.<br>
Carol knew how to enjoy the different seasons of her life. As a young woman she modeled and worked at the Valley Times newspaper. Growing up in North Hollywood, Calif., she was fascinated by the movie studios, where her brother Bob worked and where both her mother-in-law Mary Tolerton Dorsey and sister-in-law Barbara Mozley had modeled.<br>
Carol met the love of her life, Jim Tolerton , at a church dance and soon followed him to his military assignment at Fort Devon, Mass., where they shared some wonderful experiences and Carol reconnected with her family's heritage in Gloucester, Mass. After Jim returned from his military assignment in Eritrea, Carol embraced life as a stay-at-home mother of four children, Susan, David , Elizabeth and Kathy. They raised their children in Atascadero, where Carol actively volunteered for school, sports and church activities. She attended Atascadero Community church. She continuously supported her children in all of their endeavors, but the family's best times were spent on many camping trips to the Sierras, the coast or the desert.<br>
Her next season was as a working woman and mother. She worked for the Atascadero schools, A&W and Mervyn's. After retiring, she became a dedicated volunteer at French Hospital, where her daughter Elizabeth also worked. She then enjoyed staying home with her family and playing with her many grandchildren.<br>
These children and grandchildren who now survive her are daughter Susan Williamson and husband Doug, from El Dorado Hills, Calif., and their daughters, Brianna and Carissa and their son Michael. Her son David and wife Andria, who are currently stationed at the Pentagon, have three children, daughters Katie and Amelia and son Brian. Her daughter Elizabeth resides in Atascadero. Her youngest daughter Kathy and husband David reside in Templeton with their three daughters, Jennifer, Stephanie and Kristen and their son Joshua. Carol also had two special (adopted) daughters, Julie Blow of Atascadero and Anne (Coffman) Wilson of Templeton.<br>
Carol, you will be thought of and missed every moment. May God bless you, Carol (wife, mother, friend), as He takes you on your new journey.<br>
Services for Carol will be held at 10 a.m. Monday, Sept. 4, 2006, at Atascadero Community Church.<br>

<a name ="I063909"><b>[I063909]</b></a><br />
NATHANIEL W. FARRAR, druggist in the employ of C. J. Smith at Easthampton, Mass., was born in Steubenville, Jefferson County, Ohio, on July 26, 1839, son of Oscar Chandler and Elsie Ann (Patterson) Farrar.<br>
John Farrar, his great-grandfather, was a patriot soldier of the Revolutionary War.  His son Nathaniel removed in 1828 from the East to Ohio, where the last years of his life were passed. He died in Madison, eighty-three years of age, leaving one son and three daughters.   His son, Oscar Chandler Farrar, father of Mr. Farrar, was born in Shelburne, Mass., December 25, 1817, and now resides at Erie, Pa. Oscar's wife was born in Gainesville, Wyoming County, N.Y., and had by him five children, as follows: Nathaniel William; Chester Hinsdale, deceased; Orrell D., a machinist, residing in Columbus, Ohio; Myra, the wife of John Scott, of Harbor Creek, Erie County, Pa.; and Alma, married to John Stephenson, and now living in Toledo, Ohio.<br>
Mr. Farrar received his education in Ohio and at the schools of Beloit, Rock County, Wis. In 1858 he engaged in teaching, but forsook it after a short time. On August 24, 1861, he enlisted in the ranks of Company G of the Thirteenth Wisconsin Regiment, and served in the Civil War for four years and five months, after which he was honorably discharged. For the larger part of that time he was detailed to the hospital service.<br>

M., and is also a member of Post No. 166, Grand Army of the Republic, in nearly all of the offices of which he has served.<br>

She is also survived by her sister Janice Matina of New York, and her brother Bob of Ohio. She had four grand children, Aimee, Jessica, Abby and Kyle, who affectionately called her Hunna. In life, she was an avid reader, seamstress, and piano player. A special thanks to her caregiver Adrianna, who took care of her during her final years, as her memory declined. At her request, there will be no services.<br>
