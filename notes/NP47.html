<p>
<a name ="I071910"><b>[I071910]</b></a><br />
Jane B. Bundy, devoted mother and grandmother and artist, died peacefully surrounded by family on 15 June 2014 in Duluth, Georgia. She was 92. Born Jane Christian Bowden in 1922 to the late John and Caroline Bowden in Jersey City, NJ, the middle of three girls, Jane spent her youth in Westfield, NJ and at age 16 attended New Jersey College for Women (Douglass College) on scholarship, graduating in 1942 as a Physical Education major. She married W. Stimpson Brown in June 1942 and from 1943 to 1956 gave birth to five children. Jane's family-raising years with Stim were marked by a number of relocations around the East and Midwest. Her early married life was spent in New Jersey -- Parlin, Pompton Plains and Pompton Lakes --, before Stim, who worked for DuPont, was transferred to the Philadelphia area (1948), where they lived in Drexel Hill. Subsequent moves took the growing family to Flint, MI, Newark, DE, Little Silver, NJ, Marblehead, MA and finally Stone Mountain, GA. An avid tennis player into her 80's, faithful church-goer and bridge devotee, Jane traveled much of the US and abroad with Stim over the years. They celebrated their 50th wedding anniversary in 1992. After all her children were in school, Jane enjoyed working as a substitute elementary school teacher for many years (until age 79!). At the same time, she began art classes, learning a wide variety of artistic techniques, which proved to be a mainstay throughout her entire life. Her love of animals was sensitively translated into an especially memorable series of paintings, many of which were commissioned. She became an active member of the Artists Atelier in Atlanta upon its founding in 1985 by her favorite art teacher, Ouida Canaday. She also did volunteer work for many years at Atlanta's Callanwolde Fine Arts Center. Stim passed away in 1992. In a sweet "you've-got-mail" romance, Donald Bundy, a former high school beau, reconnected with Jane after 58 years. They married in 1999 and shared two happy years until his death. Jane is remembered for her amazing energy and spirit, her infectious laugh, her love of children and family, and her positive outlook on life. Jane is survived by her younger sister, Elizabeth B. Osborn (Winter Park, FLA); her five children, Wendell S. Brown (Marion, MA), Caroline B. Calbos (Watkinsville, GA.), Cynthia J. Brown (Santa Barbara, CA), Barbara B. Valentine (McMinnville, OR) and Jeffrey L. Brown (Snellville, GA); twelve grandchildren (one deceased), four great-grandchildren, and many nieces and nephews. Jane's older sister, Carol B. Lenox, died in 2006. A memorial service will be held at 11 a.m. on Thursday June 19th at the Saint Andrews Presbyterian Church in Tucker, GA 30084-4660 (4882 Lavista Road). In lieu of flowers, please send donations in memory of Jane B. Bundy to the Saint Andrews Presbyterian Church in Tucker or to the Gwinnett Humane Society, Lawrenceville, GA 30044 (3724 Lawrenceville Highway).<br>
