Francis MOORE
<p>
<a name ="I001943"><b>[I001943]</b></a><br />
After Cornelia's death in 1866, he remarried and moved to Minnesota.  Leonhard and Betsy Moore lived on the adjoining farm.  Betsy and Francis registered their ownerships on the same day, 6/29/1870.  Two years later, Betsy transferred the parcel to Francis.  I speculate that they are his parents.  Both were born about 1801 in England.  In the 1880 census, John Moore, born about 1801 in England, lived with T. T. Philips.  John is listed as father.  It must have been the father of his wife Hannah, born about 1830 in England.  Francis bought and sold several parcels of land in Sibley County. He bought and sold back several parcels to T. T. Philips. He sold them all his land in 1877.  The family moved to Boise in 1878 or 1879.  Births are recorded in Sibley County fro Eliza, Edith and Lillian.<br>

Then at age 80, she had beautiful white hair which she religiously put in curlers every night. She moved into Meadowbrook Place, which became her home.<br>

MOORE-Leon Amos Moore. Sr., was born in West Bingham, Pennsylvania, August 26, 1906, and went to his rest June 2, 1972, at Niagara Falls, New York. He was baptized at the age of nine at Camp Moxie in Pennsylvania by Elder George West. He attended Fernwood Academy, Union Springs Academy, and Atlantic Union College, where he received his Bachelor of Theology degree in 1929. He was the pastor of his graduating class.<br>
Immediately after graduation, he entered the ministry in the Northern New England Conference, interning under Elder H. P. Gram at Concord, New Hampshire; and under D. H. Hanson at Rutland, Vermont. At one time he was superintendent of the northern half of Vermont caring for eleven churches and companies. His ministry extended to most of the New England States and to New York and Pennsylvania. The depression of the 1930's made it necessary to seek other employment which led him to a variety of jobs, his last as an office worker for the Moore Business Forms, Inc., of Niagara Falls, New York, from which he took an early retirement at the age of sixty-three, after twenty-four years of service. Leon Moore was head elder of the Niagara Falls church at various times for more than twenty years, as well as serving as a Sabbath school teacher and holding other positions in the church he loved.<br>
During the first two years of his retirement he worked full time for the Lord without remuneration, giving Bible studies on an average of one hundred studies per month. During this time eleven souls were baptized through his labors. During his time in the ministry he brought more than fifty souls to the Saviour, and it was his goal to add fifty more in his retirement years. But one can only sow the seed-it is God that giveth the increase.<br>
Survivors include his mother, Ethel (Dennis) Moore; his widow, Leah (Stone) Moore; two sons, Dr. Rolet Moore, of Lancaster, California; and Leon Moore, Jr., of Niagara Falls, New York; two daughters, Mrs. Alex (Esther) Norzow, of Topsham, Maine; and Mrs. Donald (Ruth) Maskers, of Budd Lake, New Jersey; and twelve grandchildren.<br>
