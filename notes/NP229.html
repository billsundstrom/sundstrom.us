Daniel J. HARPOLD
<p>
<a name ="I060238"><b>[I060238]</b></a><br />
We sadly say goodbye to our beloved husband, son, father, brother, uncle, grandfather and friend, Daniel (Dan) "Bam" Harpold, 39.<br>
Daniel was born on Aug. 6, 1974, to Richard J. (Dick) and Marjorie D. Harpold in Madison, Wis. His sisters Brenda, Kathy and Stella were delighted to have a little brother. A few years later, the family welcomed their little sister, Kelly. Dan went home to be with the Lord on April 28, 2014.<br>
Dan attended school in Lockwood and graduated from Billings Senior High School. As a youth, he played Lockwood Little League Baseball, and in high school, played percussion in the Senior High symphonic and jazz bands. In recent years, he took pleasure in watching his stepson, niece and nephews carry on the family drumming tradition. Dan had a passion for hard rock music and attending concerts with his sister Kelly. An avid camper and fly-fisherman, he found peace in nature and music. A master at the barbecue, Dan made a "Kick-Asterisk" steak. He thoroughly enjoyed his evenings with his half-pint Guinness (his dog, not the brew). A patient and tolerant man, he could "find the funny in every situation" (a quality he shared with his dad). His calm demeanor belied his very subtle sense of humor.<br>
Dan began working with Myhre Advertising (later Lamar) on a billboard construction crew, eventually becoming a signage supervisor and traveling extensively throughout Montana. He later worked for Allied Waste and could chain the tires on a heavy multi-axle diesel truck on snowy mountain roads faster than anybody. Dan always went the extra mile for his customers. In his latest job with Coca-Cola, he proved his ability to adapt - he never met a truck he couldn't drive.<br>
Dan was a beloved member of the Horde M.C. for over 20 years. He considered them brothers and he will be deeply missed. The bonfire will never be the same.<br>
One of Dan's childhood dreams was to be a pilot. He spent time in his youth building models and (with his dad) identifying any plane in the air by the sound of its engines - something he still did as an adult.<br>
Dan married Crystal Holland in August of 1999. Together they had three girls, Samantha (Sammie) Lea, Abygale (Abby) Ruth and Elizabeth (Libby) Diane. They later divorced.<br>
On Jan. 23, 2010, he married the love of his life, Holly Rathie. This union expanded Dan's family to include his stepchildren, Casey, Cassie and Eli. He later became a grandpa with the births of Aiden and Jaxson.<br>
Dan is preceded in death by his grandparents; father, Richard (Dick) Harpold; and his infant daughter, Samantha (Sammie) Harpold.<br>
He is survived by his wife, Holly; his daughters, Abby and Libby; his stepchildren, Eli Gillman, Casey Rathie, Cassie (Taylor Nelson) Rathie, and grandchildren, Aiden and Jaxson Nelson; his mother, Marjorie (Ed Weninger); his sisters Brenda (David) Binstock and children Kyrsta, Karsen, Karter, Kathy Harpold, Stella (Mike) Milligan and children Emma, Ethan, Colin, and Kelly (Shawn) Pulse and children Zach, Skyler, Rachael; and many aunts, uncles and cousins.<br>
Friends are invited to share time and memories with the family on Monday, May 5, from 6-8 p.m. at Smith Funeral Chapel downtown. Funeral mass will be celebrated on Tuesday, May 6, at 11 a.m. at St. Bernard's Catholic Church, 226 Wicks Lane, with luncheon and burial to follow. In lieu of flowers, a family fund has been set up at First Interstate Bank.<br>
