Íñigo ARISTA
<p>
<a name ="I030933"><b>[I030933]</b></a><br />
Íñigo Íñiguez Arista (Wannaqo ibn Wannaqo, Basque: Eneko Enekones Aritza/Haritza/Aiza; c. 790 - 851 or 852) was the first King of Pamplona (c. 824 - 851 or 852). He is said by a later chronicler to have been count of Bigorre, or at least to have come from there, but there is no near-contemporary evidence of this.<br>
His origin is obscure, but his patronymic  indicates that he was the son of an Íñigo.  It has been speculated that he was kinsman of Garcı́a Jiménez, who in the late 8th century succeeded his father Jimeno 'the Strong' in resisting Carolingian expansion into Vasconia. He is also speculated to have been related to the other Navarrese dynasty, the Jiménez.<br>
His mother also married Musa ibn Fortun ibn Qasi, by whom she was mother of Musa ibn Musa ibn Qasi, head of the Banu Qasi and Moslem ruler of Tudela, one of the chief lords of Valley of the Ebro. Due to this relationship, Íñigo and his kin frequently acted in alliance with Musa ibn Musa and this relationship allowed Íñigo to extend his influence over large territories in the Pyrenean valleys.<br>
The family came to power through struggles with Frankish and Muslim influence in Spain. In 799, pro-Frankish assassins murdered Mutarrif ibn Musa, governor of Pamplona, the brother of Musa ibn Musa ibn Qasi and perhaps of Íñigo himself. Ibn Hayyan reports that in 816, Abd al-Karim ibn Abd al-Wahid ibn Mugit launched a military campaign against the pro-Frankish "Enemy of God", Velasco the Gascon, who had united Christian factions. They fought a three-day battle and the Christians were routed, with Velasco killed along with Garcı́a López, maternal uncle of Alfonso II of Asturias, Sancho "the premier warrior/knight of Pamplona", and "Saltan", similarly preeminent among the "pagans". This defeat of the pro-French force is said to have allowed the anti-French Íñigo to come to power. In 820, Íñigo is said to have intervened in the County of Aragon, ejecting a Frankish vassal, count Aznar I Galı́ndez, in favor of Garcı́a el Malo (the Bad), who would become Íñigo's son-in-law. In 824, the Frankish counts Aeblus and Aznar Sánchez made an expedition against Pamplona, but were defeated in the third Battle of Roncesvalles. Traditionally, this battle led to the crowning of Íñigo as "King of Pamplona" but he continued to be called "Lord of Pamplona", as had his predecessor Velasco, by the Arabic chroniclers. Íñigo was a Christicolae princeps (Christian prince), according to Eulogio de Córdoba.[citation needed] However, his kingdom continually played Moslem and Christian against themselves and each other to maintain independence against outside powers.<br>
<br>
In 840 his lands were attacked by Abd Allah ibn Kulayb, wali of Zaragoza, leading his half-brother, Musa ibn Musa into rebellion.[5] The next year, Íñigo fell victim to paralysis in battle against the Norse with Musa ibn Musa. His son Garcı́a acted as regent, in concert with Fortún Íñiguez, "the premier knight of the realm", the king's brother and also half-brother of Musa. They joined Musa ibn Musa in an uprising against the Caliphate of Córdoba. Abd-ar-Rahman II, emir of Córdoba, launched reprisal campaigns in the succeeding years. In 843, Fortún Íñiguez was killed, and Musa unhorsed and forced to escape on foot, while Íñigo and his son Galindo escaped with wounds and several nobleman, most notably Velasco Garcés defected to Abd-ar-Rahman. The next year, Íñigo's own son, Galindo Íñiguez and Musa's son Lubb ibn Musa went over to Córdoba, and Musa was forced to submit. Following a brief campaign the next year, 845, a general peace was achieved.[6] In 850, Musa again rose in open rebellion, supported again by Pamplona,[7] and envoys of Induo (thought to be Íñigo) and Mitio,[8] "Dukes of the Navarrese", were received at the French court. Íñigo died in the Muslim year 237, which is late 851 or early 852, and was succeeded by Garcı́a Íñiguez.<br>
The name of the wife (or wives) of Íñigo is not reported in contemporary records, although chronicles from centuries later assign her the name of Toda or Oneca. There is also scholarly debate regarding her derivation, some hypothesizing that she was daughter of Velasco, lord of Pamplona (killed 816), and others making her kinswoman of Aznar I Galı́ndez. He was father of the following known children:<br>
    * Assona Íñiguez, who married her father's half-brother, Musa ibn Musa ibn Fortun ibn Qasi, lord of Tudela and Huesca<br>
    * Garcı́a Íñiguez, the future king<br>
    * Galindo Íñiguez, fled to Córdoba where he was friend of Eulogio of Córdoba and became father of Musa ibn Galind, Amil of Huesca in 860, assassinated in 870 [13]<br>
    * a daughter, wife of Count Garcı́a el Malo (the Bad) of Aragón.<br>
<br>
The dynasty founded by Íñigo reigned for about 80 years, being supplanted by a rival dynasty in 905. However, due to intermarriages, subsequent kings of Navarre descend from Íñigo.<br>

Eneko ARITZA
<p>
<a name ="I015189"><b>[I015189]</b></a><br />
From Wikipedia<br>
<br>
King Eneko Aritza (Iñigo Iñiguez Arista, in Basque, Eneko Aritza) (c. 781-852) was the first King of Navarre in the 9th century.<br>
<br>
He was apparently also count of Bigorre and Sobrarbe.<br>
<br>
His parents were Íñigo Jiménez and Oneca.<br>
<br>
Eneko's elder brother or kinsman, Garcia Jimenez, (had) held a veritable principality in Vasconia, the original Navarre.<br>
<br>
After the death of his father, his mother married secondly Musá ibn Fortún, Lord of Banu Qasi, Muslim king of Tudela, who was one of the lords of Valley of Ebro. This marriage made Eneko influential over large territories in the Pyrenean valleys. Additionally, the clan of Banu Qasi controlled a long stretch of the fertile valley of the river Ebro.<br>
<br>
The family of Velasco was a rival of Eneko and the Banu Qasi and the nucleus of the pro-French party in northern Spain. In 799, the pro-French party assassinated Mutarrif ibn Muza, Governor of Pamplona, who belonged to the family of Banu Qasi. A Velasco became governor and the French controlled Navarrese territories.<br>
<br>
In 824 French counts Elbe and Aznar made another expedition against Pamplona. This led Eneko overthrow the Franks and pronounce the Kingdom of Pamplona. Eneko was a "Christicolae princeps" (Christian prince), according to Eulogio de Córdoba. This kingdom combined both Muslims and Christians to maintain independence against outside powers.<br>
<br>
Abd al-Rahman II of Cordoba made some reprisal against Pamplona.<br>
<br>
In 841 Eneko fell victim to paralysis. His son Garcia Iniguez acted as regent.<br>
<br>
Eneko died in 851 or 852, and apparently was succeeded by his kinsman Jimeno Garces, lord, holder of Alava etc, apparently simultaneous ruler in Vasconia, now also king of Pamplona, thus uniting the two independent Basque terrotories. Eneko, however, also left a son, Garcia Iñiguez, who managed to become the sole king in c. 860. The Basque dynasty (in form of the Jimenez line) ruled Navarre from the 9th century to 1234. Eneko's own male line lost the throne in 905. Later kings of Pamplona were Eneko's descendants through the female line. Variations in the spelling of this Basque surname are Arista and Aiza.<br>
<br>
<br>
Eneko married Oneca Velázquez, daughter of don Velasco, lord of Pamplona, and had following children:<br>
    * Assona Íñiguez, wife of Musa ibn Musa ibn Fortún, lord of Tudela and Huesca.<br>
    * Garcı́a Íñiguez, the future king.<br>
    * Galindo Íñiguez of Pamplona, father of:<br>
          Musa Ibn Galindo, Walı́ of Huesca 860, assassinated in 870 in Córdoba.<br>
    * Nunila, wife of count Garcı́a "el Malo" (the Bad) of Aragón.<br>
