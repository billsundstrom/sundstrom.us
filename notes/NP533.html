<a name ="I025063"><b>[I025063]</b></a><br />
 Happy 105th Birthday to the Amazing Jayne Blair<br>
Yes, thatʼs right! Long time Sarasota resident, Jayne Blair, born in 1913, turned 105 years young on December 11th, 2018.<br>
We wanted to follow up with Jayne since doing an article on her a few years back and she was once again more than pleased to grant us an interview. This time around we are hoping to learn where she keeps her very own secret Fountain of Youth. The following are some generalities she lives by and of course certain habits she has developed over the years. Some of these might surprise you and some are ones we all hope to incorporate in our daily routine so we might live healthier and happier, no matter how long we hope to live.<br>
Jayne has always been active and remains occupied with some of her favorites even today. She was an accomplished swimmer, ice and roller skater, even studying ballet and piano from an early age. Charity work has always been important to Jayne because she said, "it was easy too do good work when you were helping people." She still swims on occasion, has taken up Mahjong and continues her love of languages by studying Spanish.<br>
Surprisingly enough technology doesnʼt scare Jayne, she actually embraces it. She was pleased to report that in fact she can operate an IPhone, IPad and write and answer emails. Jayne makes a point of saying, "you just have to adjust to new things." She works hard to keep an open mind and "always be ready to try anything."<br>
Staying busy seems to be Jayneʼs mantra and her dog, Dilly, helps her do just that. She discourages herself from sitting too long and pushes herself to "just get up and walk!"<br>
Traveling too has always been an enjoyable hobby of Jayneʼs, the Egyptian pyramids her most memorable. She comments though that, "going 1st Class is the best way to travel because it gives you more of what you want to experience."<br>
Jayne feels she has been blessed with "good genes" on both sides. Her maternal and paternal Aunts lived to 95 and 96 years of age respectively. There are still some daily habits she follows strictly, for example not deviating from her daily schedule. She eats three meals a day without varying her routine regardless of whether she is hungry or not. The meals are always balanced with protein, veggies, carbs and fruit, but never the same protein 2 days in a row. She's careful with her sweets, but does enjoy a glass of wine, "and maybe a half glass more," now and again.<br>
Her sleep schedule is however not as regular. She averages six hours a night, but not all at once, reading books of interest when she wakes. Water has never been her "go to" beverage and I find that contradictory to what most health columnists recommend, but it obviously seems to work for her. Appearances do matter to Jayne and her mother taught her at an early age that even if you "take the trash can out, dress up!"<br>
In closing itʼs paramount to stress just how important "mind set" is to Jayne. Itʼs her outlook on life and its valuable lessons she lives by that bring her real joy. Here are just a few, "If you fall down then get yourself up, always look forward and not behind (donʼt dwell on mistakes), always try and find something you like about everyone", and "do what you can, the best way you can, and you won't be disappointed."<br>
She reminds us to look on the bright side because a "happy person lives longer!" Though life has dealt Jayne some real challenges and some obstacles over the years she credits her happy, positive outlook by reminding herself just how grateful she is for all that she has, mostly the special people in her life. Sheʼs very fortunate to have loving caregivers who treat her just like family and visa versa.<br>
Her closing advice is something for us all to live by, "just be kind and gentle," and like Jayne, have a smile and friendly word for everyone you meet. Hereʼs to you Jayne Blair, the lessons youʼve taught us, and to many more birthdays to come!<br>

Joan Adele SWEET
<p>
<a name ="I025072"><b>[I025072]</b></a><br />
SOUTH BURLINGTON Joan Sweet Boyce (93) died Wednesday, Dec. 17, at Burlington Health and Rehab. She was born in Binghamton, N.Y. on Jan. 27, 1921, the daughter of Charles and Margery Eden Sweet. Joan was the salutatorian of her high school class at Binghamton High School. She attended Duke University, where she was a proud member of Social Standards, Duke Players, Cathedral Woman's Choir, and Phi Beta Phi sorority. Joan was a beloved mother, grandmother, wife, aunt, and friend to numerous people around the world. Joan was often described as a classy lady; her panache was both refined and tough, but she was fundamentally a people pleaser who loved to laugh and be of help to others. Her curiosity and kindness gave her the special ability to talk to anybody. She married Dr. Frank Gordon Boyce, Sr. on Sept. 5, 1941, and supported his pursuits at Colgate University. She then worked beside him for 25 years when he was President of The Experiment in International Living. Joan was deeply committed to The Experiment and was very proud of her efforts contributing to furthering good will and understanding between nations. Joan joined her husband traveling the world extensively, making friendships and sharing cultural values. Joan also worked as a volunteer at the Brattleboro Memorial Hospital. Throughout her life she loved spending time at her precious family cottage on Wyoming Island in the Thousands Isles, as well as participating in the theater - singing and dancing. While living at Colgate University, she was a member of the theater players, Mask and Triangle. Her favorite role was Emily in "Our Town." Deeply aware of the preciousness of life and its fleeting quality, she often quoted Emily's lines: "Oh, Mama, look at me one minute as though you really saw me. Do any human beings ever realize life while they live it?" Her first and foremost commitment was to her family whom she loved dearly. She was predeceased by her husband in 1987, and her darling son, Jonathan Charles Boyce, who died at age 24 in 1972. She will be held in the hearts of those who loved her and those who had the pleasure of her spirited and kind companionship. She is survived by her son, Frank Gordon Boyce, Jr. and his wife, Barbara, of Blue Ridge, Ga., as well as her daughter, Johanna Boyce and her husband, Dr. Richard Munson, of Williston, Vt.; grandchildren, Victoria Larson and her husband, Scott, Joshua Boyce and his wife, Melissa, and Charlotte and Amelia Munson; great grandchildren Devan, Emma, Tyler, and Trace Larson; her sister, Jayne Blair. FUNERAL NOTICE: An informal memorial service will be held for Joan at Allenwood Independent Living, 90 Allen Rd., So. Burlington, Vt. on Sunday, Dec. 28, at 2 p.m. <br>

William SWIFT

He would have been about 10 or 11 when his parents emigrated to America. He married about 1645 in Sandwich, MA (7) to Ruth Tobey and died 7 January 1704/05 at Sandwich (8) (in 1706 according to (17)). Ruth was born about 1628 at Sandwich (6) and died after 1705 at Sandwich (7). See next section for their children. The source (17) does not mention Ruth Tobey at all but has Ruth Dillingham as his wife, marriage in 1651. It is not highly probable that his wife Ruth was at her second marriage because she would have been only about 17 or 22 at the time of her marriage to William Swift.<br>
