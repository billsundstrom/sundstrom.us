Evelyn Frances WHITEHURST
<p>
<a name ="I102913"><b>[I102913]</b></a><br />
Mrs. Evelyn Frances Davis (Whitehurst), went to meet her Savior on February 5, 2018 surrounded by her family. Mrs. Davis was born to Caleb W. and Viola M. Whitehurst in 1931 in Princess Anne County where she was a lifelong resident. She was the widow of William "Bill" Davis to whom she was married 66 years. Left to cherish her memory is her son, Thomas Leonard Davis (Lorine); daughter, Joan Davis Harper (Keith); four grandsons, David Livers, John Livers (Natalie), Justin Davis (Kaitlyn), and Kyle Davis (Elisabeth); and five great-grandchildren, Brittany, Liam, Reed, Riley and Julian.<br>
Mom was a godly and loving wife and mother who always put our Dadʼs and our needs above her own. We always knew that she was praying for us during all of our ups and downs as well as our joys and sorrows and even if we messed up, we knew that she loved us unconditionally. She never expected perfection, only our best. Her quiet prayers were always reflected by her own strong and personal relationship with our Lord and she prayed that each of us would come to know and experience a personal relationship with her Lord and Savior by keeping Christ as the center of our lives.<br>
Though she never worked outside the home, she took her job at home very seriously and worked hard to provide the best care for us. She was an awesome cook, many times using vegetables that she had canned or froze that were grown and harvested out of the huge garden that our Dad had prepared. To her, a clean home was next to godliness; so much so that you could eat off her floors, even the garage!<br>
She enjoyed the beauty of nature and had quite a green thumb for growing beautiful flowers and plants, in both flowerbeds and containers. She was fascinated and enjoyed watching hummingbirds that would fly up onto her porch. In earlier years, after Daddyʼs retirement, they enjoyed playing bingo at a local McDonaldʼs or the Senior Resource center. The past three years where she was a resident of Chesapeake Place Assisted Living, she enjoyed playing Bingo, Dominoes, Wii and UNO where she played to win but it was OK if she didnʼt.<br>
She and Daddy enjoyed traveling and seeing new sights and places throughout our beautiful country as well as meeting new people. Her sparkling blue eyes and infectious smile brought joy to everyone she met and her passing has left a void that no one else can fill.<br>
Her visitation will be held at Graham Funeral Home, on Wednesday, February 7, 2018 from 6:30 to 8:00 p.m. Her funeral and interment will be held at Oak Grove Baptist Church, Virginia Beach on Thursday, February 8, 2018 at 11 a.m. Evelyn was a lifelong member of Oak Grove where she served her Lord and Savior quietly but faithfully behind the scenes. <br>
Strength and honor are her clothing; she shall rejoice in time to come. She watches over the ways of her household. Her children rise up and call her blessed. A woman who fears the Lord, she shall be praised. Proverbs 31:25,27,30 (NKJV). <br>
