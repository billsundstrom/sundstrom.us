Robert DE MORTIMER
<p>
<a name ="I009252"><b>[I009252]</b></a><br />
Robert the father on his marriage [apparently wife's name not known] received Little Woodham (Woodham Mortimer) in Essex from Henry II by the service of 1/2 fee and probably Amberden (in Debden) as another 1/2 fee. In 1190/1 he, or his son, was assessed to the scutage of Wales for one knight's fee of the Honour of Peverel of London in Essex. Woodham and Amberden were held by Robert the son in 1212 as one fee. The father's marriage presumably took place in or before 1168, when he was pardoned a debt in the account of the sheriff of Essex. It is not easy to distinguish this Robert from his son Robert at a time when either might have been the tenant of Woodham, or to distinguish them from their namesake and contemporary Robert de Mortimer of Attleborough. . . There seems to have been as close a connection between the Mortimers of Attleborough, and their said overlords as between Robert of Essex and the King. It would appear likely that it was Robert of Essex, the protégé of Henry II, who witnessed at Valoignes the later version of the treaty of Falaise, some time in the early months of 1174, as being in the train of King Henry, while William de Mortimer of Attleborough was one of the hostages under that treaty for William the Lion--Earl of Huntingdon until his defeat at Alnwick in July 1174; also that it was Robert of Essex who, at Le Mans, witnessed a charter of Henry II, dated 1175-81 or 1177. That there was a close connection between the families of Attleborough and Richard's Castle is suggested by heraldic evidence; by the recurrence in both families of the names Robert and William (Hugh probably came in at Richard's Castle from Say); and by the few details that are known about a shadowy Pernel de Mortimer, who seems to have belonged to both families. Of her it is known that before 1199 (probably before May 1194) she held land in Dengey Hundred, in which are Woodham Mortimer and Amberden, which later was given to Tiltey Abbey; that in July 1199, as a widow, she was R. del Ech for dower in Cambe (where Mortimers of Attleborough had large holdings); and in 1203 levied a fine with William de Buckenham as to the advowson of Buckenham and land there--a Mortimer of Attleborough manor.<br>

The Mortimers of Norfolk held under the Earls Warenne a fief of which Attleborough was the caput, and Scoulton, Raveningham, Stanford and Rockland among its members. No blood relationship has been proved between them and the Mortimers; of Wigmore, but the history of the latter family was also associated with that of the great house of Warenne; for when the castle and seignory of Mortemer-sur-Eaulne were forfeited in 1054 by Roger de Mortemer (ancestor of the Mortimers of Wigmore) they were granted to William de Warenne.<br>
<br>
ROBERT DE MORTIMER, the first of the family of whom there is record in Norfolk, witnessed a charter of William de Warenne to Castleacre Priory, probably in the time of Henry I. [Complete Peerage IX:243, (transcribed by Dave Utzinger)]<br>
<br>
Note: As Henry I died in 1135, and Robert was of age when he witnessed a charter, then Robert was b. before 1114 at least. I think about 1100/1105.<br>

Roger DE MORTIMER
<p>
<a name ="I008467"><b>[I008467]</b></a><br />
Roger Mortimer, 2nd Earl of March (1328 - February 26, 1360) was an English nobleman and military commander during the Hundred Years War.<br>
<br>
He was the son of Edmund Mortimer, who was the son of Roger Mortimer, 1st Earl of March. His mother was Elizabeth Badlesmere.<br>
<br>
The Mortimer family lands and titles were lost after the first earl's revolt and death in 1330, which was followed the next year by the death of Roger's father. Roger thus grew up with uncertain prospects, and was to only gradually re-acquire the family honors.<br>
<br>
Around 1342, he received back Radnor, and the next year the old family baronial seat at Wigmore.<br>
<br>
As a young man he distinguished himself in the wars in France, fighting at Crecy and elsewhere in the campaign of 1347. Afterwards he was given livery of the rest of his lands, was one of the original Knights of the Garter, and was summoned to parliament as a baron in 1348.<br>
<br>
In 1354, the sentence passed against his grandfather the first earl was reversed, and the next year he was summoned to parliament as Earl of March. Also in 1355 he received a number of important appointments, including Constable of Dover Castle and Warden of the Cinque Ports, and accompanied Edward III's expedition to France.<br>
<br>
Around this time his grandmother, Joan de Genville, widow of the first earl, died, and Roger inherited her large estate, including Ludlow Castle, which was thereafter the Mortimer family seat.<br>
<br>
In the following years he became a member of the royal council, and was appointed constable at the castles of Montgomery, Bridgnorth, and Corfe.<br>
<br>
In 1359, and continuing into 1360, he was constable of Edward III's invasion of France, fighting in the failed siege of Reims and capturing Auxerre. The English forces then moved into Burgundy, where Roger died suddenly at Rouvray near Avallon.<br>
<br>
Roger married Philippa Montacute, daughter of William Montacute, 1st Earl of Salisbury.<br>

Roger de Mortimer, deemed by some to have been son of William de Warren, and by others, of Walter de St. Martin, brother of that William, was founder of the abbey of St. Victor, in Normandy. "It is reported," says Dugdale, "that in the year 1054 (which was twelve years before the Norman Conquest), when Odo, brother of Henry, King of France, invaded the territory of Evreux, Duke William sent this Roger, then his general (with Robert, Earl of Ewe, and other stout soldiers), to resist his attempts; who meeting with Odo near to the castle of Mortimer, gave him battle, and obtained a glorious victory. It is further observable of this Roger that he was by consanguinity allied to the Norman duke (afterwards king, by the name of William the Conqueror), his mother being niece to Gunnora, wife of Richard, Duke of Normandy, great grandmother to the Conqueror." The presumed son of this Roger, Ralph de Mortimer, accompanying the Duke of Normandy in his expedition against England, was one of his principal commanders at the decisive battle of Hastings.

Seigneur of Mortemer-sur-Eauline, in Normandy. He was probably born before 990. He was the first to take the name Mortimer, which was taken from the village and castle of Mortemer-en-Brai (mortuum mare), in the Pays de Caux, sitmacted at the source of the little river Eaulne (Eauline). In 1054 he won the victory of Mortemer, fought under the walls of his castle, against the troops of Henry I, King of the French. He offended William and was deprived of his castle of Mortemer, which was transferred to his nephew William de Warenne. The Mortimers transferred their chief seat to Saint-Victor-en Caux, where the priory, a cell of Saint-Wuen of Rouen, was 1074 erected into abbey by Roger and his wife Hawise. [Ref: Tucker]<br>
<br>
The family of Mortemer derives its name from Mortemer (Mortuo-Mari) in Pays-de-Caux at the source of the Eaulne River. The castle of St. Victor-en-Caux was the chief barony of the family, which is said to have sprung from a marriage of Walter de St. Martin and a niece of the Duchess Gonnor. It was possessed by Roger de Mortemer in 1054, on which date he was one of the commanders of Duke William's forces at the battle of Mortemer. He sheltered in his castle, after the battle, his father-in-law, Raoul III. the Great, Comte de Valois and d'Amiens, by Oderic Vital called de Montdidier, one of the French commanders, until he was able to conduct him safely to his own territories three days later. For this reason Roger was banished by Duke William and his estates confiscated. He was later pardoned and his possessions returned with the exception of the castle of Mortemer, which the Duke had given to Roger's brother, William de Warren I. He contributed sixty vassals to the fleet of Duke William and it is generally conceded that he was too old to have been present at Senlac, although he made a donation to the abbey of St. Ouen in 1074 and died prior to the compilation of the General Survey.

ROGER DE MORTEMER, Seigneur of Mortemer-sur-Eaulne in Normandy, was one of the leaders of the Norman forces at the battle of Mortemer in 1054, but having assisted the escape of one of the French prisoner, Ralph, Count of Montdidier, to whom he had done homage, he was exiled and his lands confiscated. He was afterwards reconciled to Duke William and some of his lands were restored to him, though not Moretmer, which had been given to his consanguineus William de Warrene; Saint-Victor-en-Caux thereupon became the caput of the Norman honour of the family. He is said to have founded the abbey of Saint-Victor-en-Caux. He was living in 1078 or later, but was dead in 1086, when his son Ralph appears in Domesday Book. He married Hawise.

Roger DE MORTIMER
<p>
<a name ="I004601"><b>[I004601]</b></a><br />
Roger Mortimer (1231-1282), 1st Baron Wigmore, was the son of Ralph de Mortimer and his wife, Gwladys Ddu-- daughter of Llywelyn the Great. He was a famous and honored knight, and a loyal ally of King Henry III of England. He was at times an enemy, at times an ally, of Llywelyn the Last.<br>
<br>
Mortimer fought for the king against the rebel Simon de Montfort, 6th Earl of Leicester, and almost lost his life in 1264 at the Battle of Lewes fighting Montfort's men. In 1265 Mortimer helped rescue Prince Edward and they made common cause to lure Montfort into a trap.<br>
<br>
In August 1265, Montfort's army was surrounded by the River Avon on three sides, and Prince Edward's army on the fourth. Mortimer had sent his men to block the only possible escape route, at the Bengeworth bridge. The Battle of Evesham began in earnest. A storm roared above the battle field. Montfort's Welsh soldiers broke and ran for the bridge, where they were slaughtered by Mortimer's men. Mortimer himself killed Hugh le Despencer, 1st Baron le Despencer. Finally, the royalist forces crushed Montfort's army and killed Simon de Montfort himself. Mortimer was awarded Montfort's severed head, which he sent home to Wigmore castle as a gift for his wife, Lady Mortimer.<br>
<br>
Lady Mortimer was Maud de Braose, daughter of William de Braose, Lord of Abergavenny by Eva Marshall. Roger Mortimer had married her in 1247. She was, like him, a scion of a Marcher family. Their children were:<br>
   1. Ralph Mortimer, died 1276.<br>
   2. Edmund Mortimer, 2nd Baron Wigmore (1251-1304)<br>
   3. Isabella Mortimer, died 1292. She married (1) John Fitzalan, 7th Earl of Arundel, (2) Robert de Hastings<br>
   4. Margaret Mortimer, died 1297. She married Robert de Vere, 6th Earl of Oxford<br>
   5. Roger Mortimer of Chirk, died 1326.<br>
   6. Geoffrey Mortimer, a knight<br>
   7. William Mortimer, a knight<br>
<br>
Their eldest son, Ralph, was a famed knight but died in youth. The second son, Edmund, was recalled from Oxford University and made heir. Roger Mortimer died in 1282, and was buried at Wigmore Abbey, where his tombstone reads:<br>
<br>
    "Here lies buried, glittering with praise, Roger the pure, Roger Mortimer the second, called Lord of Wigmore by those who held him dear. While he lived all Wales feared his power, and given as a gift to him all Wales remained his. It knew his campaigns, he subjected it to torment."<br>
</p>
Roger DE MORTIMER
<p>
<a name ="I006580"><b>[I006580]</b></a><br />
Roger Mortimer (25 April 1287 - 29 November 1330), grandson of the 1st Baron Wigmore, was the best-known of his name. As a result of his adulterous relationship with Isabella of France, queen of King Edward II of England, he was responsible for deposing (and probably for murdering) King Edward, and himself became effective ruler of England.<br>
<br>
Early life, family history<br>
Roger was the eldest son and first child born to Edmund Mortimer, 2nd Baron Wigmore, by his wife, Margaret de Fiennes. His father had been a second son, intended for clerical work, but on the sudden death of his elder brother, Edmund was recalled from Oxford University and installed as heir. As a boy, Roger was probably sent to be fostered in the household of his formidable uncle, Roger Mortimer of Chirk. It was this uncle who had carried the head of Llywelyn the Last to King Edward I of England in 1282.<br>
<br>
Like many noble children of his time, Roger was married young, to Jeanne de Geneville, the heiress of a neighboring lordship. They were married in 1301, and immediately began a family. Through his marriage with Jeanne de Geneville, Roger not only acquired increased possessions on the Welsh marches, including the important Ludlow Castle, which became the chief stronghold of the Mortimers, but also extensive estates and influence in Ireland.<br>
<br>
Then, suddenly, childhood came to a crashing halt when Edmund Mortimer was mortally wounded in a skirmish near Builth in July 1304. Since Roger was underage at the death of his father, Edmund Mortimer, he was placed by Edward I under the guardianship of Piers Gaveston, and was knighted by Edward in 1306. In that year also Roger was endowed as Baron Wigmore, and came into his full inheritance. His adult life began in earnest.<br>
<br>
Military adventures in Ireland, Wales<br>
In 1308 he went to Ireland in person, to enforce his authority. This brought him into conflict with the De Lacys, who turned for support to Edward Bruce, brother of Robert Bruce, king of Scotland. Mortimer was appointed lord-lieutenant of Ireland by Edward II. In 1316, at the head of a large army, he drove Bruce to Carrickfergus and the De Lacys into Connaught, wreaking vengeance on their adherents whenever they were to be found.<br>
<br>
He was then occupied for some years with baronial disputes on the Welsh border until about 1318.<br>
<br>
Opposition to Edward II<br>
In 1318, Mortimer joined the growing opposition to Edward II and the Despensers, and he supported Humphrey de Bohun, 4th earl of Hereford, in refusing to obey the king's summons to appear before him in 1321.<br>
<br>
Forced to surrender to the king at Shrewsbury in January 1322, Mortimer was consigned to the Tower of London, but escaped to France in August 1324. In the following year Queen Isabella, wife of Edward II, anxious to escape from her husband, obtained his consent to her going to France to use her influence with her brother, King Charles IV, in favour of peace. At the French court the queen found Roger Mortimer; she became his mistress soon afterwards, and at his instigation refused to return to England so long as the Despensers retained power as the king's favourites.<br>
<br>
Invasion of England and defeat of Edward II<br>
<br>
The scandal of Isabella's relations with Mortimer compelled them both to withdraw from the French court to Flanders, where they obtained assistance for an invasion of England. Landing in England in September 1326, they were joined by Henry Plantagenet, 3rd Earl of Leicester; London rose in support of the queen, and Edward took flight to the west, pursued by Mortimer and Isabella.<br>
<br>
After wandering helplessly for some weeks in Wales, the king was taken prisoner on 16 November, and was compelled to abdicate in favour of his son. Though the latter was crowned as Edward III on January 25, 1327, the country was ruled by Mortimer and Isabella, who are believed to have arranged the murder of Edward II in the following September at Berkeley Castle.<br>
<br>
Powers won and lost<br>
Rich estates and offices of profit and power were now heaped on Mortimer, and in September 1328 he was created Earl of March. However, he was no more competent than the Despensers to conduct the government of the country. His own son, Geoffrey, mocked him as "the king of folly". The jealousy and anger of Lancaster had been aroused by Mortimer's rise, and Lancaster prevailed upon the young king, Edward III, to assert his independence. At a parliament held at Nottingham in October 1330 a plot was successfully carried out by which Mortimer was arrested in the castle. In spite of Isabella's entreaty to her son to "Fair son, have pity on the gentle Mortimer," was conveyed to the Tower.<br>
<br>
Accused of assuming royal power and of various other high misdemeanours, he was condemned without trial and hanged at Tyburn on 29 November, 1330, his vast estates being forfeited to the crown. Mortimer's widow, Jeanne, received a pardon in 1336 and survived till 1356. She was buried beside Mortimer at Wigmore, but the site was later destroyed. They had 12 children together:<br>
<br>
   1. Edmund Mortimer (1302-1331)<br>
   2. Margaret Mortimer (1304-1337), married Thomas de Berkeley, 3rd Lord Berkeley<br>
   3. Roger Mortimer (1305-1338)<br>
   4. Maud Mortimer (1307-aft.1345), married John de Charlton, Lord of Powys<br>
   5. Geoffrey Mortimer (1309-1372/1376)<br>
   6. John Mortimer (1310-1328)<br>
   7. Joan Mortimer (1311/1313-1337/1351), married James Audley, 2nd Baron Audley<br>
   8. Isabella Mortimer (1311/1313-aft.1327)<br>
   9. Catherine Mortimer (1311/1313-1369), married Thomas de Beauchamp, 11th Earl of Warwick<br>
  10. Agnes Mortimer (1315/1321-1368), married Lawrence Hastings, 1st Earl of Pembroke<br>
  11. Beatrice Mortimer (1315/1321-1383), married (1) Edward, 2nd Earl of Norfolk; (2) Thomas de Braose, 1st Baron Brewes<br>
  12. Blanche Mortimer (1314/1322-1347), married Piers de Grandison, 2nd Lord Grandison<br>
<br>
His eldest son, Edmund, was father of another Roger Mortimer, who was restored to his grandfather's title.<br>

Also, around this time (1126 when Alan's marriage took place), William Mortimer of Attleborough, in Norfolk, was active as an envoy between England and Scotland and assisted in the introduction of Norman style feudalism into lowland Scotland, by arranging the marriage of young Norman knights into the Scottish aristocracy, and it is my belief, that Alan must have been a younger son of William.

Garcia III DE NARVARRE
<p>
<a name ="I007721"><b>[I007721]</b></a><br />
Garcı́a Sánchez Abarca of Navarre (d. 1000), called "the Trembling," was briefly King of Pamplona 994-1000.<br>
<br>
He was the son of King Sancho Garcés II Abarca and Queen Urraca Fernández of the family of the Counts of Castilla. He married Jimena Fernández, daughter of Count Fernando Vermúdez of Cea and his wife Elvira. Among their children were the future king Sancho Garcés III and Urraca, later the second wife of Alfonso V of Leon.<br>
<br>
He tried to escape the submission his father had offered to Córdoba, as a result of which he had to face Almanzor. In 996 he was forced to seek peace in Córdoba.<br>
<br>
Towards the year 997, during an expedition of Pamplonans to the land of Calatayud, Garcı́a killed the governor's brother. Almanzor took revenge by killing 50 Christians.<br>
<br>
In the Battle of Cervera in July 1000, he allied with Count Sancho Garcı́a of Castile, Alfonso V of Leon and Garcı́a Gómez of Carrión.From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia<br>

<br>
Garcı́a Sánchez II, sometimes Garcı́a II, III, IV or V (died 1000-1004), called the Trembling, the Tremulous, or the Trembler (in Spanish, el Temblón) by his contemporaries, was the king of Pamplona and count of Aragón from 994 until his death. He was the son of King Sancho II and Urraca Fernández.<br>
<br>
Throughout his reign, his foreign policy seems to have been closely linked to that of Castile. His mother was aunt of count Sancho Garcı́a of Castile, and also of the powerful count of Saldaña, Garcı́a Gómez of Carrión, and she appears to have played a role in forming a bridge between the kingdom and county.<br>
<br>
He joined his cousin Sancho in attempting to break from the submission his father had offered to Córdoba, as a result of which he had to face Almanzor. In 996 he was forced to seek peace in Córdoba. In 997 during an expedition into the land of Calatayud, Garcı́a killed the governor's brother. Almanzor took revenge by beheading 50 Christians. At the Battle of Cervera in July 1000, he joined, along with count Garcı́a Gómez of Saldaña, in a coalition headed by count Sancho Garcı́a of Castile that was defeated by Almanzor (that count Sancho led the group is thought to reflect Garcı́a's decline). Tradition names him one of the Christian leaders at the 1002 Battle of Calatañazor, which resulted in the death of Almanzor and the consequent crisis in the Caliphate of Córdoba, but there is no contemporary record of him after 1000, while his cousin Sancho Ramı́rez of Viguera may have been ruling in Pamplona in 1002. Garcı́a was certainly dead by 1004, when his son Sancho Garcés III first appears as king.<br>
<br>
Domestically, he granted the rule in Aragon to his brother Gonzalo, under the tutelage of his mother Urraca.[1] A tradition reports that he freed all of the Muslim captives being held in the kingdom. He had married by August 981, Jimena, daughter of Ferdinand Vermúdez, count of Cea by Elvira Dı́az (aunt of count Garcı́a Gómez of Saldaña). Among their children were the future king Sancho and Urraca, later the second wife of Alfonso V of Leon.<br>
</p>
Blanca DE NAVARRE
<p>
<a name ="I007535"><b>[I007535]</b></a><br />
Blanca of Navarre, (aft. 1133, Pamplona - August 12, 1156), was Crown Princess of Castile 1151-1156, but never the full queen, as she died before her father-in-law. She was the daughter of king Garcia VI of Navarre "The Restorer" and Marguerite de L'Aigle de Rotrou, from France. Her brother was Sancho VI "The Wise" King of Navarre who reigned 1150-94.<br>
<br>
Blanca was married to the future Sancho III of Castile el Deseado (the Beloved) on January 30, 1151 in Catahorra, Logrono, but died before her father-in-law, and her widowed husband later reigned only briefly as king of Castile 1157-58. She had several children who did not survive and are buried in the church of San Pedro in Soria. On November 11, 1155 she gave birth to the future king Alfonso. There appears to be no record of her activities thereafter, except for her death on August 12, 1156. While it had been suggested that she might have died from the complications of a new pregnancy, Valdez maintains that she died from sequelae of the birth of her son. That her death was caused by a pregnancy is recorded in an epitaph.<br>
<br>
Sancho donated money to the monastery of Santa Maria la Real in Najera where she is buried. The sarcophagus of the queen is regarded as a primary example of the ability to express artistically human emotions in the 12th century.<br>
</p>
Blanca DE NAVARRE
<p>
<a name ="I008341"><b>[I008341]</b></a><br />
Blanche de Navarre was Countess-consort of Champagne, then acted as regent of Champagne, and finally also as regent of her native kingdom of Navarre. She was born in 1170's and died 1229.<br>
<br>
She was the youngest daughter of Sancho VI of Navarre (who died 1194) and Sancha of Castile, the daughter of Alfonso VII.<br>
<br>
Her eldest brother Sancho VII of Navarre succeeded their father as king of Navarre. Her brother Ramiro of Navarre was Bishop of Pamplona, and her elder sister Berengaria of Navarre married Richard I of England and Aquitaine, the northern neighbor of their kingdom.<br>
<br>
She herself was married to Count Theobald III of Champagne, who died already in 1201. At that time, she was pregnant, and then gave birth to son, who immediately became count Theobald IV of Champagne (1201-53). Blanca ruled the county as regent until Theobald turned 21 in 1222.<br>
<br>
The regency was plagued by a number of difficulties. Blanca's brother-in-law, count Henry II had left behind a great deal of debt, which was far from paid off when Theobald III died.<br>
<br>
Further, their son Theobald's legitimacy was not unquestioned, and his right to the succession was challenged by Henry's daughter Philippa and her husband, Erard I of Brienne, count of Ramerupt and one of the more powerful Champagne nobles.<br>
<br>
The conflict with the Briennes broke into open warfare in 1215, and was not resolved until after Theobald came of age in 1222. At that time Theobald and Blanca bought out their rights for a substantial monetary payment.<br>
<br>
Blanca had also arranged the dowry to Henry II's elder daughter Alice, when she was married to the young king of Cyprus. In 1230's, in order to settle with Alice, Theobald IV had to sell his overlordship over the counties of Blois, Sancerre, and Chateaudun to the king of France.<br>
<br>
Blanca's brother Sancho VII of Navarre was the last male-line descendant of the first dynasty of kings of Navarre, the Pamplona dynasty, and was childless.<br>
<br>
Sancho went into retirement ("el Encerrado") at some point, when Blanca took administration of the kingdom.<br>
<br>
Blanca died in 1229, her brother in retirement remaining as king of Navarre and her son Theobald continuing as count of Champagne.<br>
<br>
Their eldest sister, Berengaria, queen of England, died 1232 childless, thus leaving Sancho alone as children of Sancho VI. When he died, Blanca's son Theobald of Champagne was recognized as the next monarch in Navarre in 1234. Count Theobald IV thus succeeded his uncle Sancho VII of Navarre as king of Navarre.<br>
<br>
Theobald had married twice during Blanca's lifetime, but had not succeeded in producing children. Blanca went to grave not seeing future for her dynasty. However, afterwards, Theobald had children in his third marriage.<br>
</p>
Garcia VI DE NAVARRE
<p>
<a name ="I007994"><b>[I007994]</b></a><br />
Garcia Ramirez, called the Restorer, was Lord of Monzon, and in 1134 became King of Navarre.<br>
<br>
He was born in the 1110s as the grandson of a bastard son of Garcia V of Navarre. His parents were Ramiro Sanchez de Monzon (of bastard Navarrese royal ancestry) and Cristina Rodriguez Diaz de Vivar, daughter of Rodrigo Diaz de Vivar, El Cid Campeador, the recent lord of Valencia.<br>
<br>
When Aragon, which had from 1076 taken over in Navarre, lost its warrior king Alfonso I of Aragon and fell into a succession crisis, Garcia managed to wrest Navarre from his also illegitimate Aragonese cousins in 1134.<br>
<br>
He was obliged to surrender Rioja to Castile in 1136, and to declare himself a vassal of King Alfonso VII of Castile.<br>
<br>
Garcia was utterly incompetent, and at various times was dependent upon the revenues of churches and convents. He was succeeded in 1150 by his more competent son, Sancho VI of Navarre (the Wise).<br>
</p>
Henri DE NAVARRE
<p>
<a name ="I008337"><b>[I008337]</b></a><br />
King Henry I of Navarre (c. 1244-1274), nicknamed le Gros (that is, the Fat), was as Henry III the Count of Champagne and Brie, and, as Henry I of Navarre, King of Navarre 1270-1274.<br>
<br>
He was born as the youngest son of Theobald I of Navarre and Champagne (who had in 1234 became King Theobald I of Navarre) and Margaret of Bourbon. In December 1270 Henry succeeded his eldest brother Theobald V of Champagne (Theobald II of Navarre) as King of Navarre and Count of Champagne.<br>
<br>
His proclamation at Pamplona, however, did not take place till March of the following year, and his coronation was delayed until May 1273. After a brief reign, characterized, it is said, by dignity and talent, he died in July 1274, suffocated, according to the generally received accounts, by his own fat.<br>
<br>
After his death with no male heir, the male line of the counts of Champagne and kings of Navarre became extinct.<br>
<br>
In 1269 Henry married Blanche, daughter of Robert, Count of Artois, and niece of King Louis IX. He was succeeded by his only legitimate child, Joan I of Navarre; her 1284 marriage to Philip IV (who became King of France in the same year) united the crown of Navarre to that of France, with Champagne becoming part of the French royal domain.<br>
</p>
Jeanne DE NAVARRE
<p>
<a name ="I008264"><b>[I008264]</b></a><br />
Jeanne (or Joan or Johanna) of Navarre (c. 1271 - April 4, 1305), Queen Consort of France, was the daughter of king Henry I of Navarre and Blanche of Artois. In 1274, upon the death of her father, she became Countess of Champagne and Queen Regnant of Navarre. Her mother was her guardian and regent in Navarre. Various powers, both foreign and Navarrese, sought to take advantage of the minority of the heiress and the weakness of the female regent, which caused Joan and her mother to seek protection at the court of Philip III of France.<br>
<br>
At the age of 13, Jeanne married his son and heir Philip IV of France on August 16, 1284, becoming Queen of France a year later. The crowns of Navarre and France were henceforth united for almost half a century. Their children were:<br>
   1. Marguerite (1288-1300)<br>
   2. Louis X of France (October 4, 1289 - June 5, 1316)<br>
   3. Blanche (1290-1294)<br>
   4. Philip V of France (1293 - January 3, 1322)<br>
   5. Charles IV of France (1294 - February 1, 1328)<br>
   6. Isabelle (1296 - August 23, 1358), married Edward II of England<br>
   7. Robert (1297 - July 1308)<br>
<br>
Their three surviving sons would all become Kings of France, in turn, and their only surviving daughter Queen of England. Jeanne herself died under mysterious circumstances; one chronicler even accused her husband of having killed her.<br>

Sancho Garcés II Abarca DE NAVARRE
<p>
<a name ="I015142"><b>[I015142]</b></a><br />
From Wikipedia<br>
<br>
Sancho II Garcés Abarca of Navarre (aft. 935 - December 994), of the Basque dynasty of Aritza, was King of Pamplona and count of the valley of Aragon from 970 to 994.<br>
<br>
He was the son of Garcı́a Sanchez III and Andregoto Galı́ndez, herself the daughter and heiress of Count Galindo II Aznárez of Aragon.<br>
<br>
The Historia General de Navarra by Jaime del Burgo says -- referencing in turn the Anales del Reino de Navarra of José de Moret -- that on the occasion of the donation of the villa of Alastue by the king of Pamplona to the monastery of San Juan de la Peña in 987, he titled himself "King of Navarre," the first time that title had been used. In many places he appears as the first King of Aragon and in others the third.<br>
<br>
He is said to have been the first historical king of this dynasty.<br>
<br>
The valley of Aragon he had inherited from his mother.<br>
<br>
He was at least the 6th King of Pamplona, and apparently the 9th.<br>
<br>
Under Sancho and his immediate successors, Navarre reached the height of its power and its largest size.<br>
<br>
During this period the kingdoms of Leon and Navarre and the County of Castile were united by familial bonds; the Navarrese monarchy supported the young Ramiro II of Leon.<br>
<br>
Upon the death of Al-Hakam II in 976 and the succession of his son Hixem II, who had been taught by Almanzor, the prospects of the Christian kingdoms became even worse: the troops of Almanzor defeated the Christians at Torrevicente, south of Soria; afterwards they returned to triumph at Taracueña, near Osma.<br>
<br>
In 975 Sancho was defeated by the Moors at San Esteban de Gormaz, and in 981 at Rueda, a dozen kilometers from Tordesillas, the Christians suffered another humiliating defeat.<br>
<br>
Because he could not defeat Almanzor by arms, Sancho went to Córdoba as an ambassador for his own kingdom, bringing many gifts for the victorious Almanzor, making a pact with him and agreeing to give the Muslim his daughter in marriage. From this union was born Abd al-Rahman Sanchuelo, the second successor of lord Almanzor and who tried to usurp the Caliphate of Córdoba from the Umayyad heir.<br>
<br>
Sancho married Urraca Fernández of Castile around 962, the daughter of count Ferdinand Gonzalez and possibly of Sancha of Pamplona. Before 950 Urraca had been married to Ordono III of Leon de Aza de Najera and in 956 she married his enemy, conqueror and successor Ordono IV of Leon the Bad, from whom she separated. Sancho was the third and last husband.<br>
<br>
<br>
Children:<br>
    * Garcı́a IV Sanchez "the Trembling", King of Pamplona, who married Jimena Fernández<br>
    * Ramiro of Navarre (d. 992)<br>
    * Gonzalo of Navarre. Some documents list him as count of Aragon. He ruled together with his mother, Urraca, under the dependency of his father.<br>
    * Abda (Urraca) "the Basque" of Navarre, given to Almanzar before entering a convent. Larousse mentions Urraca Teresa of Navarre, married to Ramiro II of Leon and mother of Sancho I "the Fat" "the Crass" of León<br>
</p>
Sancho III DE NAVARRE
<p>
<a name ="I007719"><b>[I007719]</b></a><br />
From Wikipedia<br>
<br>
Sancho III "The Great" of Navarre (c. 985-October 18, 1035) was Count of Aragon and King of Navarre from 1000 or 1004 until his death, as well as overlord of Castile (from 1029). In his lifetime, he was the most important Christian monarch of Spain. Having gone further than any of his predecessors in uniting the principalities of Spain, his life's work was undone, from a modern point-of-view, when shortly before his deathhe divided his domains to provide for each of his sons.<br>
<br>
Born to Garcı́a the Tremulous of Pamplona and Jimena Fernández, daughter of the Count of Cea (in the Galician frontier), he ascended the throne in 1000 or 1004, inheriting Navarre and Aragon. He later profited from the internal difficulties of Sobrarbe-Ribagorza utilizing his interests and rights as descendant of Dadildis of Le Pailhars and annexed that kingdom in 1016-1019.<br>
<br>
With his nephew, king Alfonso V of Leon and Count Garcı́a Sánchez of Castile, he led a combined attack against Almanzor, conquering further territories in the south. After the crisis in the Caliphate, initiated by the death of Almanzor and leading to fragmented principalities, so-called Taifa kingdoms, Sancho aspired to unify the Christian principalities.<br>
<br>
However, relation between the three Christian entities soured after the assassination of Count Garcı́a of Castile in 1027. He had been bethrothed to Sancha of Leon, with Alfonso V of Leon gaining from Castile lands between river Cea and Pisuerga as his price for approving the pact. As Garcia arrived in Leon for his wedding, he was killed by sons of a noble he had expelled from his lands.<br>
<br>
Sancho III had opposed the wedding and the ensuing Leonese expansion and got his chance to act after Garcia's death. As the late count's brother-in-law he immediately occupied Castile and was soon engaged in full-scale war with Leonese forces under King Bermudo. The combined Castilean and Navarrese armies quickly overran Bermudo's kingdom, occupying Astorga and even the city of León in 1034. This was the height of Sancho's rule which now extended from the borders of Galicia in the west to the county of Barcelona in the east and he styled himself Rex Hispaniarum, "King of the Spains".<br>
<br>
Taking residence in Najera instead of the traditional capital of Pamplona, as his realm grew larger, he considered himself a European monarch, establishing relations on the other side of the Pyrenees with the Duchy of Gascony.<br>
<br>
Issue and succession:<br>
    * Ramiro Sánchez de Aragón, bastard, born of Sancha de Aibar<br>
    * Fernando I "The Great" (1017-1065), king of Castile (1035-1065) and León (1037-1065)<br>
    * Garcı́a Sánchez "of Nájera", king in Pamplona<br>
    * Gonzalo Sánchez, king of Sobrarbe and Ribagorza, died 1038.<br>
    * Bernardo Sánchez de Navarra.<br>
<br>
Sancho was married to Muña Mayor Sánchez, daughter of count Sancho I of Castile. Besides four legitimate sons he also fathered one by his mistress Sancha de Aybar, named Ramiro, who was the eldest of his sons but as bastard not entitled to succeed. Before his death in 1035 Sancho divided his possessions among his sons. Fernando received Castile and the high kingship, Garcı́a received Navarre and the Basque country and Gonzalo got Sobrarbe and Ribagorza. The illegitimate son Ramiro obtained the county of Aragon, which was elevated to a kingdom, though very small as it was at that era, hence Ramiro was known as "the petty king".<br>
</p>
Sancho VI DE NAVARRE
<p>
<a name ="I007459"><b>[I007459]</b></a><br />
Sancho VI Garces, (c.1133 - June 27, 1194), King of Navarre (1150-1194). He was called el Sabio ("The Wise").<br>
<br>
Son of Garcia Ramirez and Marguerite de l'Aigle, he was the first to use the name of "King of Navarre" as the only designation of his kingdom, dropping Pamplona out of the titulary use. His reign was full of clashes with Castile and Aragon.<br>
<br>
He married Sancha of Castile in 1157, the daughter of Alfonso VII. Their children were:<br>
   1. Sancho VII of Navarre<br>
   2. Ramiro, Bishop of Pamplona<br>
   3. Berengaria of Navarre d 1230/32<br>
   4. Blanca of Navarre, married Count Theobald III of Champagne, then acted as regent of Champagne, and finally as regent of Navarre.<br>
<br>
He died on June 27, 1194 in Pamplona.<br>
</p>
Bernard DE NEUFMARCHE
<p>
<a name ="I004620"><b>[I004620]</b></a><br />
Possibly the half brother of William the Conqueror.<br>
<br>
Inherited Neufmarche Castle which was seized c. 1060 by Duke William. He was a companion in arms of the Conqueror whom he accompanied to the battle of Hastings and c. 1088 subdued the territory of Brecknock in Wales. In the same year he granted lands in Brecknock to Sir Reginal d'Aubrey. Bernard continued in the career of arms till an advanced age and served in wars under three kings of England with great bravery. [Falaise Roll, p. 8]<br>
<br>
Son-in-law of Osbern FitzRichard of Richard's Castle. In the absence of a dominant overlord, lands on the Welsh border were amassed by lesser lords such as Bernard de Neufmarche, founder of a family which would loom large in the history of Wales. [A History of Wales, p. 105]<br>
<br>
Lord of Brecon; son of Geoffrey (son of Thurcytel) and Ada, daughter of Richard FitzGilbert; m . Nesta ferch Osborn; father of Sibyl whom. Miles FitzWalter of Gloucester. [Ancestral Root s, p. 152]<br>
<br>
Son-in-law of Richard Scrupe; conqueror of Brecknock; dau. m. Miles of Gloucester; one of the Norman magnates who opposed William Rufus. [The Victoria History of the Counties of England : Herefordshire, p. 357-8]<br>
<br>
Brecon Castle, Aberhonddu (Powys) is associated with the Norman occupation of the area, and in particular with Bernard de Neufmarche who ousted Rhys ap Tewdwr in 1093 and soon afterwards established his rule over the area with the raising of a motte-and-bailey on the confluence of the Honddu and the Usk, and at some distance from the Roman fort. Neufmarche founded the Benedictine priory, and its church, St John's in the first decade of the 12th century. [The Castles of Wales, p. 40-41]<br>
<br>
As was the custom under the Norman feudal system, Bernard Newmarch divided the land of Bycheiniog between himself and his chief followers; and these became in course of time, through intermarriage with the Welsh, more than Norman. A large portion of William the Conqueror's forces were pure or mixed Celts from Brittany, Normandy, and elsewhere. Many of them were descendants of Cynry from Wales, who had sought refuge and settlement in Brittany during the Saxon and Danish troubles; and it is more than probable that some of Newmarch's companions were of this description, and only restored the purity of their Celtic blood by alliances with the people of Brycheiniog. The example of marrying into Welsh families was set by Bernard Newmarch himself, who took to wife the notorious Nest, daughter of Trahaearn ap Caradog, and niece of Llywelyn ap Seissyllt.<br>
