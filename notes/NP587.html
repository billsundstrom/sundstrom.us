The remains of Isaac O. Wickstrom reached here Friday, from Ogallala, where he died on last Wednesday, and on Saturday afternoon they were interred in Elmwood Cemetery.<br>
Mr. Wickstrom was born in Boden, Sweden on May 26th, 1853, being at the time of his death 67 years, 9 months and 16 days old. In 1877 he came to America, settling at Dannebrog where he resided for about 3 years. He then moved west, going to Wyoming, where he entered the employ of the UP railroad people and for 30 years resided in that state and followed that line of work. He then returned to Howard county and resided here ever since until a few months ago when he moved with his family to Ogallala where he was residing when the grim reaper appeared and called him home.<br>
In May 1877 he was married to Mary J. Isaacson and to this union 10 children were born, 3 of whom survive. They are Fred W., Mrs. Merle Weber of Ogallala and George W. of Grand Island, all of whom were present at the funeral. The bereaved wife and children have the sympathy of the entire community in their hour of sorrow. There is also one brother, Gus Wickstrom, left to mourn his death.<br>
Mr. Wickstrom was a quiet, unassuming man and he had many friends who were shocked to learn of his death. He leaves a fine family of children as a monument of his memory and by his works and his deeds he will be long remembered by those whom he came in contact.<br>
The funeral was held from the M. E. Church on Saturday afternoon, Rev. M. M. Long having charge of the same. After the conclusion of the services at the church the remains were conveyed to Elmwood where they are now at rest awaiting that day when all shall rise again.<br>
The Phonograph desires to join the friends and acquaintances of the deceased in offering sympathy and condolence to the bereaved family in their sorrow and trouble. <br>

She was also an active member of the Scandinavian Association and her Scandinavian heritage was very important to her. She had a cookbook left open to Sverska Pepparkokor (Swedish spice cookies). She was already planning for the upcoming St. Lucia festivities. In 1979 she traveled to Sweden where she met relatives, visited the home of her father, her mother's ancestral home, and the church where her father was baptized. <br>
Joann loved to visit. She enjoyed company and an unexpected visitor was always welcome at her door. She didn't let anyone out the door without a cup of coffee or something to eat. She made friends where ever she went and will be missed by many. <br>
