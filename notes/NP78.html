Adelia CASSADAY
<p>
<a name ="I063360"><b>[I063360]</b></a><br />
At the home of her daughter, Mrs. Byron Vaughn, in Edgerton, Wis., May 6, 1891, Mrs. Adelia Gates, in the 63d year of her age.<br>
Mrs. Gates was born in Oneida county, N. Y., June 15, 1828. In 1847 she was married to David Ayers, who died a few months after the marriage. In 1852 she was married to Martin Gates, with whom she came to Wisconsin. She had been a faithful member of the Albion Church for twenty-eight years, and the large attendance at the funeral attested the high esteem in which she was held by all. She will be greatly missed in the various activities of the church. For a year she had lived in Edgerton, at the home of her daughter, Mrs. Byron Vaughn.<br>
Her friends will ever remember her as a woman of a gentle Christian character, who in many ways was ever trying to do good to others. Her children will remember her by a love which can only be called forth by a pure Christian mother.<br>

<a name ="I006857"><b>[I006857]</b></a><br />

John Paul CASSADY
<p>
<a name ="I002587"><b>[I002587]</b></a><br />
When he was in high school, John Cassady could bench-press his own weight, but his skills at a different kind of bench-a lab bench-are where he shines these days. A summer of work as an undergraduate researcher with HHMI investigator Bruce Walker at Massachusetts General Hospital has inspired Cassady to pursue a Ph.D. in biochemistry and a career in HIV research.<br>
Cassady grew up in Minnesota, where he focused on sports as well as academics. As a senior in high school, he was captain of both the football and track teams, and he competed in the Junior Nationals Olympic-style weightlifting championship. From sports, he says, he learned how to cooperate, manage time, and deal with disappointment-skills that should serve him well in a career in scientific research.<br>
With his sights set on being a nuclear engineer to help develop nuclear power for cars, Cassady won admission to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). But during the summer between his freshman and sophomore years of college, he worked for a biology professor at the University of Minnesota. "It was a mundane job, just pipetting and using the mass spectrometer machine, but it was exciting," he says. So, as a sophomore, he switched majors to biology, determined to pursue research "that can actually make a difference in someone's life."<br>
Cassady is drawn to the challenge of fighting AIDS. As a participant in HHMI's Exceptional Research Opportunities Program (EXROP), which offers summer research experiences for disadvantaged and minority undergraduates in the labs of HHMI investigators or HHMI professors, Cassady worked with Walker to analyze HIV's ability to evade immune response by altering the expression of messenger RNA (mRNA) in cells. During his EXROP experience, he says, he was inspired to pursue graduate work in HIV research. He has continued working in Walker's lab approximately 15 hours a week throughout his senior year.<br>
"I chose to research HIV because I'm very interested in how the virus works and the development of a cure for this devastating disease," explained Cassady, 22. He envisions using new techniques, such as stem-cell research, to increase the body's immune response to the virus.<br>
From his own experience changing majors, however, Cassady realizes that goals can change. So he has decided to pursue a Ph.D. in biochemistry, to master versatile research techniques that can be applied to different fields. Currently applying to graduate schools, Cassady is confident about his future. "I know that as long as I work my hardest and stay determined, I will not disappoint myself." <br>

My Background by Nora Cassady Hiner<br>
<br>
My grandparents on both sides came from Ireland. Mama's family the "McCann's" came from Tyrone, Ireland & settled in Minnesota.<br>
<br>
My father's family the "O'Cassady's" came from County Clare & settled in Eastern Ontario, Canada.<br>
<br>
My mother had two sisters and five brothers. My father had one brother, and six sisters. He came to the United States after his mother's death & homesteaded in Minnesota not far from the McCann's. When my father received his citizenship papers he dropped the O on his family name.<br>
<br>
His brother, father & sisters came to U.S. later & settled near my father. I knew my grandfather Cassady & grandma McCann. Papa's brother: Tom & sisters: Margaret, Mary, Sarah, Ella, Hannah & Bridget.<br>
<br>
Mama's brothers were Tom, John, Henry, Jim & Gene & sisters Margaret & Mamie.<br>
<br>
My brothers & sisters were & are: Frank, Anna (Tootsie), (Leo), John, Alphonse, Alice, Mat, George & Angus, Underlined have passed away. Leo died at birth.<br>

Thomas CASSADY
<p>
<a name ="I005433"><b>[I005433]</b></a><br />
Name is spelled Cassidie in the 1861 census.<br>
The St. Peter's Roman Catholic Church have a cemetery less than 1/4 mile from the farm where he lived.  There are two Cassady's buried there, Thomas and P. Cassady.  <br>
I assume that the the Thomas in the cemetery is the father of Francis and the husband of Sarah.<br>
The "P" of P. Cassady could be a trascription error.  So this could daughter-in-law of Thomas. <br>
I assume it to be his daugher-in-law, Johanna Younge.<br>
