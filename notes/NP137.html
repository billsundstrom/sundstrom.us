Aubrey DE VERE
<p>
<a name ="I004964"><b>[I004964]</b></a><br />
Aubrey de Vere II (1062-1141) was also known as "Alberic de Vere". He was the second of that name, being the first son of Alberic de Vere who had come with William the Conqueror to England in 1066 and had fought in the Battle of Hastings. Their lineage is of an ancient Norman noble family of Vere, originally from the eponymous town of Ver-sur-Mer, and are said to descend from Charlemagne's sister Redburga(?).<br>
<br>
In 1133, King Henry I declared the first Lord Great Chamberlain Robert Malet's estates and titles forfeit, and awarded the office of Lord Great Chamberlain to Aubrey, whose son Aubrey de Vere III, was created Earl of Oxford, and whose descendents were to hold the title until 1526.<br>

Beatrix DE VERMANDOIS
<p>
<a name ="I004735"><b>[I004735]</b></a><br />
Beatrice, born c.?880 was the daughter of Herbert I, Count of Vermandois.[1] She was also the sister of Herbert II, Count of Vermandois, and was a descendant in the male line of Charlemagne through King Bernard of Italy.[a][3] Through her marriage to Robert I, she was an ancestress of the Capetian dynasty. On 15 June 923 her husband Robert was killed at the Battle of Soissons shortly after which their son Hugh was offered the crown but refused. Beatrice died after March, 931<br>
</p>
Herbert DE VERMANDOIS
<p>
<a name ="I016263"><b>[I016263]</b></a><br />
Herbert of Winchester (also styled Herbert the Chamberlain) of unproven ancestry, d. in or shortly bef. 1130, Chamberlain and Treasurer under William II and Henry I, held lands in Hampshire in 1086, and afterwards held other lands in Bedfordshire, Hampshire, Gloucester and Yorkshire. [Ancestral Roots] Note: AR may be confusing him with his son.<br>
<br>
-----------------------------------------<br>
<br>
Herbert was evidently part of a conspiracy to overthrow Henry I in 1118 and was dismissed [from office of Chamberlain] and Suger of St Denis indicates that he was treated with mercy and was only castrated and blinded! [Richard Borthwick, post to SGM, 30 Jan 1998]<br>
<br>
-----------------------------------------<br>
<br>
This very ancient family from which the chivalrous house of Herbert and other eminent houses sprang, derived originally in England from Herbert, styled Count of Vermandois, who came over at the Conquest with the first William and filled the office of Chamberlain to William Rufus. He was great-grandson of Herbert, Comte de Vermandois, the lineal descendant of Charlemagne. Herbert is mentioned in the Battle Abbey Roll and was rewarded by a grant of lands in Hampshire. His wife was Emma, daughter of Stephen, Earl of Blois, by Adela, daughter of William the Conqueror, and by that lady left a son and heir, Herbert Fitz-Herbert. [John Burke, History of the Commoners of Great Britain and Ireland, Vol. IV, R. Bentley, London, 1834, p. 728, Jones, of Llanarth]<br>

<br>
Herbertus Regis Camerariius, the ancestor of all the Herberts, was Chamberlain in fee to Henry I, two of whose charters he attest at Windsor in 1101. There are only conjectures as to his lineage, of which in reality nothing whatever is known. He died "not long before 1130," and left, according to Eyton, three sons: 1. Herbert FitzHerbert; 2. Stephen FitzHerbert; and 3. William FitzHerbert, Archbishop of York in 1143, who was canonized by Pope Honorius III in the succeeding century. [Battle Abbey Roll II:61]<br>
</p>
Herbert DE VERMANDOIS
<p>
<a name ="I004755"><b>[I004755]</b></a><br />
Herbert I of Vermandois (c. 848/850 - 907), Count of Vermandois, Count of Meaux, Count of Soissons, and lay abbot of Saint Quentin. He was a Carolingian aristocrat who played a significant role in Francia.<br>
Herbert was the son of Pepin of Vermandois. Herbert became count of Soissons before 889 and was probably charged with defending the Oise against Viking intrusions. A contemporary of Baldwin II, Count of Flanders he had the advantage of being a Carolingian, a great-grandson of Pepin of Italy, a son of Charlemagne. Herbert controlled both St. Quentin and Péronne and his activities in the upper Somme river valley, such as the capture and murder (rather than ransom) of his brother Raoul in 896, may have caused Baldwin II to have him assassinated in 907.<br>
Herbert arranged a marriage alliance to Robert of Neustria by giving in marriage his daughter Beatrice as Robert's second wife. As a part of this pact Herbert also agreed to his son Herbert II of Vermandois marrying Adela, Robert's daughter by his first wife<br>
</p>
Hugh DE VERMANDOIS
<p>
<a name ="I004838"><b>[I004838]</b></a><br />
From Wikipedia<br>
<br>
Hugh of Vermandois (1053 - October 18, 1101), was son to King Henry I of France and Anne of Kiev, and the younger brother of King Philip I of France. He was in his own right Count of Vermandois. He married Adela of Vermandois, the daughter of Heribert IV, Count of Valois and Adela de Vexin. William of Tyre called him "Hugh Magnus", Hugh the Great, but he was an ineffectual leader and soldier, great only in his boasting.<br>
<br>
In early 1096 Hugh and Philip began discussing the First Crusade after news of the Council of Clermont reached them in Paris. Although Philip could not participate, as he had been excommunicated, Hugh was said to have been influenced to join the Crusade after an eclipse of the moon on February 11, 1096.<br>
<br>
That summer Hugh's army left France for Italy, where they would cross the Adriatic Sea into territory of the Byzantine Empire, unlike the other Crusader armies who were travelling by land. On the way, many of the soldiers led by fellow Crusader Emich of Leiningen joined Hugh's army after Emich was defeated by the Hungarians, whose land he had been pillaging. Hugh crossed the Adriatic from Bari in southern Italy, but many of his ships were destroyed in a storm off the Byzantine port of Dyrrhachium. Hugh and most of his army was rescued and escorted to Constantinople, where they arrived in November of 1096. Prior to his arrival, Hugh sent an arrogant, insulting letter to Emperor Alexius I, demanding that Alexius meet with him: "Know, O King, that I am King of Kings, and superior to all, who are under the sky. You are now permitted to greet me, on my arrival, and to receive me with magnificence, as befits my nobility." Alexius was already wary of the armies about to arrive, after the unruly mob led by Peter the Hermit had passed through earlier in the year. Alexius kept Hugh in custody in a monastery until Hugh swore an oath of vassalage to him.<br>
<br>
After the Crusaders had successfully made their way across Seljuk territory and, in 1098, captured Antioch, Hugh was sent back to Constantinople to appeal for reinforcements from Alexius. Alexius was uninterested, however, and Hugh, instead of returning to Antioch to help plan the siege of Jerusalem, went back to France. There he was scorned for not having fulfilled his vow as a Crusader to complete a pilgrimage to Jerusalem, and Pope Paschal II threatened to excommunicate him. He joined the minor Crusade of 1101, but was wounded in battle with the Turks at Heraclea in June, and died of his wounds in October in Tarsus.<br>
<br>
By his wife, Adele of Vermandois, Hugh had seven children:<br>
   1. Count Raoul I of Vermandois<br>
   2. Simon, Bishop of Noyon<br>
   3. Isabella de Vermandois, married (1) Robert de Beaumont, 1st Earl of Leicester; (2) William de Warenne, 2nd Earl of Surrey<br>
   4. Matilde de Vermandois, married Raoul I of Beaugency<br>
   5. Constance de Vermandois, married Godefroy de la Ferte-Gaucher<br>
   6. Agnes de Vermandois, married Bonifacio, Marchese del Vasto<br>
   7. Beatrix de Vermandois, married Hugh III of Gournay-en-Bray<br>
</p>
Rodrigo Diaz DE VIVAR
<p>
<a name ="I008000"><b>[I008000]</b></a><br />
Rodrigo Dı́az de Vivar (c. 1040 - July 10, 1099), known as El Cid Campeador, was a Castilian nobleman, a military leader and diplomat who, after being exiled, conquered and governed the city of Valencia. Rodrigo Dı́az was educated in the royal court of Castile and became the alférez, or chief general, of Alfonso VI, and his most valuable asset in the fight against the Moors.<br>
El Cid was born circa 1040 in Vivar, also known as Castillona de Bivar, a small town about six miles north of Burgos, the capital of Castile. His father, Diego Laı́nez, was a courtier, bureaucrat, and cavalryman  who had fought in several battles. Despite the fact that El Cid's mother's family was aristocratic, in later years the peasants would consider him one of their own. However, his relatives were not major court officials; documents show that El Cid's paternal grandfather, Lain, only confirmed five documents of Ferdinand I's, his maternal grandfather, Rodrigo Alvarez, certified only two of Sancho II's, and the Cid's own father confirmed only one. This seems to indicate that El Cid's family was not composed of major court officials.<br>
<br>
El Cid was married in July 1075 to Alfonso's kinswoman Jimena Dı́az. The Historia Roderici calls her daughter of a Count Diego of Oviedo, a person unknown to contemporary records, while later poetic sources name her father as an otherwise unknown Count Gomez de Gormaz. <br>
Tradition states that when the Cid laid eyes on her he was enamored of her beauty. Together El Cid and Jimena had three children. Their daughters Cristina and Marı́a both married into the high nobility; Cristina to Ramiro, Lord of Monzón, grandson of Garcı́a Sánchez III of Navarre via an illegitimate son; Marı́a, first (it is said) to a prince of Aragon (presumably the son of Peter I) and second to Ramón Berenguer III, count of Barcelona. El Cid's son Diego Rodrı́guez was killed while fighting against the invading Muslim Almoravids from North Africa at the Battle of Consuegra (1097).<br>
His own marriage and those of his daughters raised his status by connecting El Cid to the peninsular royalty; even today, most European monarchs and many commoners of European ancestry descend from El Cid, through Cristina's son, king Garcı́a Ramı́rez of Navarre and to a lesser extent via a granddaughter Jimena of Barcelona, who married into the Counts of Foix.<br>
</p>
Maud DE WALTON
<p>
<a name ="I009972"><b>[I009972]</b></a><br />
Obviously there is a great deal of confusion over everything about Maud, but her first name--and that one of her husbands, at least, was John le Strange. Following are what some respected sources state:<br>
<br>
Ancestral Roots (249-32) merely states "Maud de Walton" (no parents, which at least is the simplest way of dealing with Maud). They cite as source "(CP [Complete Peerage] XII (1) 353, 354; C. L'Estrange Ewen, 'Observations on the LeStranges' (1946), chart opp. p. 1; 'LeStrange Records', 184-254)."<br>
<br>
Magna Charta Sureties (137-4) states "Maud, perhaps, a de Deyville. (CP XII (1), 352-353; 'Misc. Gen. et Her.', 5th Series, IX 254-8 says she was daughter of Sir John de Wauton of Wauton Deyville. See also 'Pedigree and Progress' (Wagner) ped. 57; 'Le Strange Records, 184-253)."<br>
<br>
Note: other than a slight difference in page numbers, some commas, and Le Strange with or without a space, they seem to be quoting pretty much the same sources. MCS suggests she is daughter of Deyville, but gives the text of the source that suggests Sir John de Wauton.<br>
<br>
Burke's Peerage states "Maud, daughter and heiress either of Roger de Deyville, of Walton Deyville, Warwicks, or of Ebles de Montibus, of Ketton, Rutland, leaving (presumably by his 2nd wife, since her putative paternity would account for the unusual forename Ebles being given to the 2nd son)."<br>
<br>
------------------------------------------------------<br>
It looks like we have 3 choices for Maud: de Walton or Wauton, de Deyville, or de Montibus. I am definitely tilting toward "Maud de Wauton" since I found the following at the Stradling family website "www.stradling.org.uk/docs/Oth_recs.htm", which touches on the matter because Maud de Wauton married John de Stradling as her first husband. The website is quoting material from "VCH - Warwick extract":<br>
------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
Victoria County History of Warwickshire.<br>
<br>
A) vol 3, page 131<br>
"Certain lands in Losley [Loxley, of Robin Hood fame] were sold with the manor of Walton Mauduit by the Earl of Warwick to Simon de Wauton, Bishop of Norwich (1258-66). The bishop conveyed them to John de Wauton, who was probably his great-nephew. Subsequently John de Wauton received from Walter Giffard, Archbishop of York (1266-79), a grant of the two Walton manors and all his land in Loxley; this was possibly the carucate and 100s. in rents which Henry le Foun and Isabel his wife quitclaimed to the archbishop in 1278. The archbishop was perhaps acting as trustee for John de Wauton whose daughter and heir Maud, was in 1279 a ward of Godfrey Giffard, Bishop of Worcester, Walter's younger brother. Maud married, first John de Stradling by whom she had no issue, and secondly John le Strange. In 1294 it was said that John de Wauton had done homage for his land in Loxley to the Prior of Kenilworth and that John de Stradling had offered to do so, but that, as he had had no issue by his wife, the prior was unwilling to receive it."<br>
<br>
B) Vol 5, page145,<br>
"The history of the portion of Wellesbourne north and east of the Dene Brook is obscure. Dugdale's assertion that it was granted by one of the ancient Earls of Warwick' to a member of the Hastang family is based only on the fact that in 1279 a very small estate, half a virgate, in Little Wellesbourne was held by Godfrey Giffard, Bishop of Worcester, of William Pacy, who held of Robert Hastang and he of the earl; if there was any such mesne lordship it has left no trace. In January 1246 Mr. Simon de Wauton (or Walton) received a grant of a weekly market on Wednesday and a fair on the eve and day of SS. Peter and Paul at his manor of LITTLE WELLESBOURNE. This Mr. Simon, who bought property in Walton Deyville, became Bishop of Norwich in 1258 and died in 1265. His successor Sir John de Wauton died in or shortly before 1277, leaving a widow Isabel, who married Henry le Foun, and a young daughter Maud. She married Sir John de Strattelinges, or Stradling, and they had a regrant of the market and Fair at Little Wellesboume in 1290. Sir John was dead by February 1293 and Maud married John Lestrange of Knockin, who died in 1309, leaving a son John. As her third husband she married Thomas Hastang, who was returned in 1316 as holding Walton with the hamlet of Wellesbourne, which from this time onwards becomes known as WELLESBOURNE HASTANG, or more often HASTINGS, or WELLESBOURNE LESTRANGE, and descends with the manors of Walton.<br>
<br>
In 1086 the Count of Meulan held two estates of WALTON. One of these was rated at 5 hides and had been held by Saxi; the other, formerly held by Gida and Saied, was of 10 hides. Both came to the Earls of Warwick and in 1166 Earl William, in the return of his fees, notes that Walton used to render the service of one knight's fee but was then in demesne and held by his mother, the Countess Gundred, in dower. The overlordship continued attached to the earldom and is mentioned as late as 1639.<br>
<br>
In the time of Henry I one part of Walton seems to have been held by Theodoric, or Tierry, and the other by Spilebert. When the family of Deyville, from whom the manor of WALTON DEYVILLE acquired its name, became enfeoffed here is uncertain, but Walter Deyville gave the tithe of his mill at Walton to the nuns of Pinley, probably about 1230. Robert Deyville was holding a knight's fee here from the Earl of Warwick in 1242 and Walter was granted free warren in his manor of Walton in 1252. His successor, Roger Deyville, became heavily indebted to the Jews and sold the manor to Simon de Wauton, who granted it to his son John. This Simon may have been identical with the Mr. Simon who held the manor of Welles-bourne Hastings (see above) and who in 1240 bought from William Mauduit and Alice his wife 6 acres in Walton called Litlemede lying beside the Portwey. Mr. Simon was elderly when he became bishop and may well have been married when young. John de Wauton died in 1277, and his widow Isabel married Henry le Foun. John's heir, his daughter Maud, was a child, and in 1278 Henry and Isabel conveyed the manors of Walton and other lands to Walter Giffard, Archbishop of York. On the death of Walter in the following year these estates passed to his brother Godfrey Giffard, Bishop of Worcester, who in 1281 conveyed them to Robert Burnel, Bishop of Bath and Wells, for life, with remainder to Maud, whom he undertook to marry to one of the elder sons of either his brother Hugh Burnel or of Sir Robert de Escales. As already mentioned, however, Maud married first Sir John de Strattelinges and secondly John Lestrange of Knockin, and thirdly Thomas Hastang."<br>

John DE WARENNE
<p>
<a name ="I005077"><b>[I005077]</b></a><br />
John de Warenne (June 30, 1286-June 1347), 8th Earl of Surrey or Warenne, was the last Warenne earl of Surrey.<br>
<br>
He was the son of William de Warenne, the only son of John de Warenne, 7th Earl of Surrey. His mother was Joanna, daughter of Robert de Vere, 5th Earl of Oxford.<br>
<br>
Warenne was only six months old when his father died, and was 7 years old when his mother died. He succeeded his grandfather as earl when he was 19.<br>
<br>
He was one of the great nobles offended by the rise of the Edward II's favorite Piers Gaveston, and help secure Gaveston's 1308 banishment. The two were somewhat reconciled after Gaveston's return the next year, but in 1311 Warenne was one of the nobles who captured Gaveston. He was however unhappy about Gaveston's execution at the behest of the earl of Warwick, which pushed him back into the king's camp.<br>
<br>
The baronial opposition was led by the king's cousin Thomas, Earl of Lancaster, and he and Warenne became bitter enemies. Private war erupted between the two, and over the new few years Warenne lost a good part of his estates to Lancaster.<br>
<br>
Warenne was one of the four earls who captured the two Roger Mortimers, and in 1322 he was one of the nobles who condemned to death the earl of Lancaster.<br>
<br>
Warenne and his brother-in-law Edmund Fitzalan, 9th Earl of Arundel were the last two earls to remain loyal to Edward II after the rise to power of Queen Isabella and Roger Mortimer. After Arundel's execution he went over to the queen's side, urging Edward II's abdication in 1327.<br>
<br>
He was the guardian of his cousin Edward Balliol, and after Balliol lay claim to the Scottish throne, accompanied him on his campaign in Lothian. Balliol created Warenne earl of Strathern, but this was in name only for the properties of the earldom were held by another claimant.<br>
<br>
On May 25, 1306 Warenne married Jeanne of Bar, daughter of count Henry III of Bar and Eleanor, eldest daughter of king Edward I of England. The two were soon estranged and live apart, and had no children, though the marriage was never dissolved. Warenne instead took up with Matilda de Nerford, by whom he had several illegitimate children, and later with Isabella Holland, sister of Thomas Holand, later earl of Kent.<br>
<br>
Warenne died in 1347 and is buried at the monastery of Lewes. He was succeeded as earl by his nephew Richard Fitzalan, who was also earl of Arundel.<br>

John Plantagenet DE WARENNE
<p>
<a name ="I004995"><b>[I004995]</b></a><br />
From Wikipedia<br>
<br>
John de Warenne (1231?- September 27, 1304), 7th Earl of Surrey or Warenne, was prominent during the reigns of Henry III and Edward I. During his long life he fought in the Barons' War and in Edward I's wars in Scotland.<br>
<br>
He was the son of William de Warenne, Earl of Surrey or Warenne, and Maud (or Matilda) Marshal. His mother was the daughter of William Marshal and widow of Hugh Bigod, 3rd Earl of Norfolk. Thus Roger Bigod, 4th Earl of Norfolk, was his elder half-brother.<br>
<br>
Warenne was a boy when his father died, and for the rest of his minority Peter of Savoy was the guardian of his estates. In 1247 he married Henry III's half-sister Alice de Lusignan. This marriage was to create resentment amongst the English nobility, who did not like seeing a wealthy English nobleman marrying a penniless outsider.<br>
<br>
During the following years Warenne was closely associated with the court faction centering on his in-laws. In 1254 he accompanied the king's son Edward (the future Edward I) on Edward's journey to Spain to marry Eleanor of Castile.<br>
<br>
During the conflicts between Henry III and his barons Warenne started as a strong supporter of the king, switched to support for Simon de Montfort, and then returned to the royalist party. He opposed the initial baronial reform plan of May 1258, but along with other opponents capitulated and took the oath of the Provisions of Oxford.<br>
<br>
By 1260 Warenne had joined the party of Simon de Montfort, but switched back to the king's side in 1263. After the Battle of Lewes, which was fought near his castle at Lewes, he fled to the Continent, where he remained for about a year. He returned to fight in the campaign which culminated in the Battle of Evesham and the siege of Kenilworth Castle.<br>
<br>
Warenne served in Edward I's Welsh campaigns in 1277, 1282, and 1283. In 1282 he received the lordships of Bromfield and Yale in Wales. A good part of the following years were spent in Scotland. He was one of the negotiators for the 1289 treaty of Salisbury and for the 1290 treaty of Brigham, and accompanied the king on Edward's great 1296 invasion of Scotland.<br>
<br>
On August 22, 1296 the king appointed him "warden of the kingdom and land of Scotland". However he returned to England a few months later claiming that the Scottish climate was bad for his health. The following spring saw the rebellion of William Wallace, and after much delay Warenne led an army northward, where they were defeated at the Battle of Stirling Bridge.<br>
<br>
Nevertheless the king appointed Warenne captain of the next campaign against the Scots in early 1298. He raised the siege of Roxburgh and re-took the castle at Berwick. The king himself took the field later that year, and Warenne was one of the commanders at the Battle of Falkirk.<br>
<br>
Warenne and Alice de Lusignan had three children:<br>
    * Alice, who married Henry Percy and was the mother of Henry Percy, 1st Baron Percy of Alnwick;<br>
    * Isabella, who married John Balliol and was the mother of Edward Balliol;<br>
    * William, who married Joanna, daughter of Robert de Vere, earl of Oxford, and was accidentally killed at a tournament on December 15, 1286; his son John succeeded his grandfather as earl of Surrey.<br>

FROM UPHAM FAMILY HISTORY pp. 55-59: "William de Warrenne, Earl of Warrenne in Normandy, and first Earl of Surrey, a near kinsman of William the Conqueror, held immense possessions in England, the reward of his services at the battle of Hastings. He married Gundred, or Gundreda, daughter of King William, and resided at the castle of Lewes, in Sussex."<br>

<br>
The Following is from pboren@@pnut.rand.org (Pat Boren) and may contain errors:<br>
<br>
William de Warenne was considered a near kinsman of William the Conqueror. He received large grants of land in England in rocognition of his distinguished part in the Battle of Hastings. In 1075 he was appointed joint chief justiciar and helped suppress the rebellion of the earls of Hereford and Norfolk. In 1077 he founded the St. Pancras Priory of Lewes (where he is buried), the first house of the Cluniac order in Enland. The position of his castle at Lewes rendered his loyalty especially useful to King William Rufus during the rebellion of 1088, for which he was granted the earldom of Surrey. In addition to Lewes, William held over 40 manors in sussex. He married Gundred and had Reginald, Edith and William.<br>
<br>
From Wikipedia<br>
<br>
William de Warenne, 1st Earl of Surrey, (died 1088) was one of the Norman aristocrats who fought at the Battle of Hastings and became great landowners in England.<br>
<br>
He was a son of Ralph de Warenne and Emma and a grandnephew of duchess Gunnor, wife of duke Richard I of Normandy. As a young man he helped secure duke William's hold on Normandy, most notably in the campaigns of 1052 through 1054 which culminated in the Battle of Mortemer. After this battle Roger de Mortemer forfeited most of his lands, and the duke gave them to William. The de Warenne surname derives from the castle of that name on the River Varenne, which flows through the territory William acquired in Upper Normandy.<br>
<br>
William was one of the nobles who advised duke William when the decision to invade England was being considered. He fought at Hastings, and afterwards received the Rape of Lewes in Sussex, and subsequently lands in twelve other shires. In addition to the cluster around Lewes, there were clusters around the castles he built at Castle Acre in Norfolk and Conisbrough in Yorkshire. By the time of the Domesday survey he was one of the wealthiest landholders in England.<br>
<br>
William was loyal to William II, and it was probably after the rebellion of 1088 that he was created Earl of Surrey. He died shortly afterwards of wounds he received while helping suppress the rebellion.<br>
<br>
He married twice, first to Gundred (Latin: Gundrada), sister of Gerbod, Earl of Chester, and secondly to a sister of Richard Gouet. William and Gundred had three children: William de Warenne, 2nd Earl of Surrey (d. 1138); Edith de Warenne who married Gerard de Gournay; and Reynold de Warenne, who inherited lands from his mother in Flanders and died before 1118.<br>
<br>
It was at one time thought that Gundred was a daughter of William the Conqueror and his wife Matilda of Flanders. This was disproved in the 19th Century but nevertheless remains in many faulty genealogies. William and Gundred were married around 1070, when her brother Frederick was killed by Hereward the Wake.<br>
</p>
William II DE WARENNE
<p>
<a name ="I005023"><b>[I005023]</b></a><br />
From Wikipedia<br>
<br>
William de Warenne, 2nd Earl of Surrey (d. 1138), was the son of William de Warenne, 1st Earl of Surrey and his first wife Gundrada. He is more often referred to as Earl Warenne or Earl of Warenne than as Earl of Surrey.<br>
<br>
Sometime around 1093 he tried to marry Matilda (or Edith), daughter of king Malcolm III of Scotland. She instead married Henry I of England, and this may be the cause of William's great dislike of Henry I, which was to be his apparent motivator in the following years.<br>
<br>
He accompanied Robert Curthose in his 1101 invasion of England, and afterwards lost his English lands and titles and was exiled to Normandy. There he complained to Curthose that he expended great effort in the duke's behalf and had in return lost nearly everything. Curthose's return to England in 1103 was apparently made to convince his brother to restore William's earldom. This was successful, though Curthose had to give up he had received after the 1101 invasion, and subsequently William was loyal to king Henry.<br>
<br>
To further insure William's loyalty Henry considered marrying him to one of his many illegitimate daughters. He was however disuaded by Archbishop Anselm of Canterbury, for any of the daughters would have been within the prohibited degrees of consanguinity. The precise nature of the consanguinous relationship Anselm had in mind has been much debated, but it is most likely he was referring to common descent from the father of duchess Gunnor.<br>
<br>
William was one of the commanders on Henry's side (against Robert Curthose) at the Battle of Tinchebray in 1108. Afterwards, with his loyalty thus proven, he became more prominent in Henry's court.<br>
<br>
In 1110 Curthose's son William Clito escaped along with Helias of Saint-Saens, and afterwards Warenne received the forfeited Saint-Saens lands, which were very near his own in upper Normandy. By this maneuver king Henry further assured his loyalty, for the successful return of Clito would mean at the very least Warenne's loss of this new territory.<br>
<br>
He fought at the Battle of Bremule in 1119, and was at Henry's deathbed 1135.<br>
<br>
In 1118 William acquired the royal-blooded bride he desired when married Isabella de Vermandois. She was a daughter of count Hugh of Vermandois, a son of Henry I of France, and was the widow of Robert de Beaumont, 1st Earl of Leicester.<br>
<br>
By Isabella he had 3 sons and 2 daughters:<br>
    * William de Warenne, 3rd Earl of Surrey;<br>
    * Reginald, who inherited his father's property in upper Normandy. He married Adeline, daughter of William, lord of Wormgay in Norfolk, by whom he had a son William, whose daughter and sole heir Beatrice married first Dodo, lord Bardolf, and secondly Hubert de Burgh;<br>
    * Ralph<br>
    * Gundrada, who married first Roger de Beaumont, 2nd earl of Warwick, and second William, lord of Kendal, and is most remembered for expelling king Stephen's garrison from Warwick Castle;<br>
    * Ada, who married Henry of Scotland, 3rd Earl of Huntingdon<br>

From Wikipedia<br>
<br>
William de Warenne, 3rd Earl of Surrey (d. 1148), was the eldest son of the William de Warenne, 2nd Earl of Surrey and Elizabeth of Vermandois. He was thus a great-grandson of Henry I of France, and half-brother to Robert de Beaumont, 1st Earl of Leicester, Waleran de Beaumont, and Henry de Beaumont, Earl of Bedford.<br>
<br>
He was generally loyal to king Stephen. He fought at the Battle of Lincoln (1141), and was one of the leaders of the army that pursued the empress Matilda in her flight from Winchester, and which captured Robert of Gloucester.<br>
<br>
He was one of the nobles that, along with Louis VII of France, took crusading vows at Vezelay in 1146, and he accompanied the initial army of the First Crusade the next year. He was killed by a Turkish attack while the army was marching across Anatolia on their way to the Holy Land.<br>
<br>
William married Adela (or Ela), daughter of William Talvas, count of Ponthieu, who was the son of Robert of Bellême. They had one child, a daughter, Isabel, who was his heir. She married first William of Blois, second son of king Stephen, and who became earl of Warenne or Surrey. After he died without children in October 1159, she married Hamelin, half-brother of Henry II, who also became Earl of Warenne or Surrey. He took the de Warenne surname, and their descendents carried on the earldom.<br>

ROHAND, the first of the Saxon Earls of Warwick, temp. ALFRED, the Great, left an only daughter and heiress, FELICIA, who espoused GUY, son of Siward Lord of Wallingford, and conveying the earldom to her husband he became Guy, EARL OF WARWICK, " the memory of whom, (saith Dugdale) for his great valour, hath ever since been, and yet is so famous, that the vulgar are of opinion that he was a man of more than ordinary stature, and the Welsh, taking notice of his brave exploits will needs have him to be descended from British parentage." The achievements of this chivalrous earl, true or fabulous, are so generally known, that it is almost unneccessary to refer to Dugdale's Warwickshire in which they are fully set forth.<br>
