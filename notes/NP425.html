<p>
<a name ="I076411"><b>[I076411]</b></a><br />
Sharon our beloved wife, mother, sister and aunt passed peacefully from this earth on August 10, 2010 after bravely battling breast cancer for nine years.<br>
She was born to Willard and Mae Pfrommer in Harvey, Illinois on June 17, 1955, little sister to Barbara and Don. She graduated from Glacier High School in 1973 and went on to earn her Bachelors and Masters Degrees in Education from Central Washington University.<br>
At the time of her death she worked as a Teacher-Librarian at Cougar Creek Elementary in Lakewood School District, where she passed along her joy of reading and her passion for books to hundreds of children. This same joy was passed along to children in Arlington School District while teaching at Kent Prairie and Presidents Elementary. She loved watching the children's faces light up as they discovered the worlds between the covers of books, she knew the name of every child and could instantly choose a book that would not be too hard or too easy for each child. Besides reading, Sharon loved gardening, hiking, being outdoors, music and spending time with her family. Sharon was an active member of Bethlehem Lutheran Church.<br>
She leaves behind her husband, Denny; and daughter, Rachel. She also leaves her sister, Barbara (Steve) Smiles; and brother, Don (Debra) Pfrommer; numerous nieces, nephews and cousins.<br>
She was preceded in death by her parents, Willard and Mae Pfrommer; and nephew, Donald Pfrommer.<br>
Sharon believed that cancer was not a reason to stop living but a reason to keep living. She believed there was still life to live, life to enjoy and much work to be done and a little thing like cancer wasn't going to stop her.<br>
Family graveside services will be held Tuesday, August 17. A memorial celebrating her life will be held at 1:00 p.m. on Saturday, August 21, at Bethlehem Lutheran Church.<br>
