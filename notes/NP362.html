Kathryn Lannon Garnett neeʼ Meade, has passed peacefully, surrounded by family.  Though born in Seattle, Katie was from an old California family. As had her mother, Lannon Merrill, she attended Los Angeles High School and, in her grandmotherʼs footsteps, the University of Colorado - where she affiliated with Delta Gamma.

Katie was active in the flower business for years in Palos Verdes, where she and Bill made their home. In her floral work, she spent many happy years arranging the decor for weddings, birthdays and other events in the greater Los Angeles area. When their children were grown, Katie & Bill relocated to Santa Barbara to be near them. Katie was known for her wonderful smile and irrepressible social instincts and skills - as an example she recently summoned family and friends far and wide to an elegant home on the beach in Carpinteria. It was to be her farewell party. Katie was preceded in departing for heaven by her husband of many years, Bill.
