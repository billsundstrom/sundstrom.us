<p>
<a name ="I122602"><b>[I122602]</b></a><br />
A family house on Sammyʼs Beach named Sail-Ho brought a young Richard C. Burchell to East Hampton in the mid-1960s. It was one of many ports of call for a man who over 50 years spent 14 years at sea aboard 25 ships. <br>
He spent about three years in East Hampton, working at Samʼs restaurant while here. <br>
Mr. Burchell, who was 77, died on Dec. 10 in Fernandina Beach, Fla., after being diagnosed with cancer two weeks earlier. <br>
Born on Feb. 16, 1940, in Portchester, N.Y., to Edgar and Marjorie Burchell, he grew up in nearby Mamaroneck, where his family had relocated, and he graduated from Bellows High School. He went on to earn a Bachelor of Science in marine education from the United States Merchant Marine Academy in Kings Point in 1962, after which he embarked upon a 50-plus-year career at sea. Of the many places he visited, Cape Town, South Africa, was his favorite, his family said.<br>
In 1969, he married Allison McGrath, but the marriage ended in divorce. Their son, Jonathan Edgar Burchell, died in a plane crash in 2003 in the Kenya outback while tracking, capturing, and collaring lions for research.<br>
The older Mr. Burchell enjoyed fishing, boat restoration, sailing, and listening to jazz. He is survived by a sister, Janet Norcross, of Marblehead, Mass., two nieces, and a nephew. <br>
