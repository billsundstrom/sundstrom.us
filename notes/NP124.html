William DE BRAOSE
<p>
<a name ="I004656"><b>[I004656]</b></a><br />
Guillaume de Briouze is recorded in lists of those present at the Battleof Hastings. He became the first Lord of the Bramber Rape by 1073 andbuilt Bramber Castle. William made considerable grants to the abbey ofSaint Florent, Saumur to endow the foundation of Sele Priory near Bramberand a priory at Briouze. He continued to fight alongside King William inthe campaigns in Britain, Normandy, and Maine.<br>

William de Braose came into England with the Conqueror and held, at thegeneral survey, considerable estates in the counties of Berks, Wilts,Surrey, Dorset, and Sussex. He was s. by his son, Philip de Braose. [SirBernard Burke, Dormant, Abeyant, Forfeited and Extinct Peerages, Burke'sPeerage, Ltd., London, 1883, p. 72, Braose, Baron Braose, of Gower]<br>

<br>
William de Braose, First Lord of Bramber (d. 1093/1096) was a Norman nobleman who participated in the Battle of Hastings in support of William the Conqueror.<br>
<br>
De Braose was given lands in southwest England adjacent to Wales and became one of the most powerful of the Marcher Lords.<br>
<br>
William was succeeded as Lord of Bramber by his son, Philip. William was present for the consecration of a church in his hometown of Briouze (whence the name Braose), France, in 1093, so we know he was alive in that year. However, Philip was issuing charters as Lord of Bramber in 1096, indicating that William died sometime between those dates.<br>
</p>
William II DE BRAOSE
<p>
<a name ="I004652"><b>[I004652]</b></a><br />
William was very fortunate in his marriage to Berta. All of her brothers died young without heirs, so she brought a number of important lordships to the de Braoses in 1166. These included Brecon and Abergavenny. William became Sheriff of Hereford in 1174. His interest in Sussex was maintained as he confirmed the grants of his father and grandfather fro the maintenance of Sele Priory and extended St Mary's, Shoreham.<br>
<br>
William m. Berta, dau. of Milo de Gloucester, Earl of Hereford, and co-heir of her brother, William, Earl of Hereford, by whom he acquired Brecknock, with other extensive territorial possessions. He had two sons, William and Reginald, and was s. by the elder. [Sir Bernard Burke, Dormant, Abeyant, Forfeited and Extinct Peerages, Burke's Peerage, Ltd., London, 1883, p. 72, Braose, Baron Braose, of Gower]<br>

<br>
William de Braose, Third Lord of Bramber (d. ca. 1180) was the eldest son of Philip de Braose, Second Lord of Bramber. William married Bertha de Pitres, daughter of Miles of Gloucester, Earl of Hereford. Through this marriage, William acquired lordship of Brecon and Abergavenny in 1166 because Bertha's brothers all died young without heirs.<br>
<br>
In 1174, William became sheriff of Hereford. He was succeeded as Lord of Bramber by his son, William.<br>
</p>
William III DE BRAOSE
<p>
<a name ="I004650"><b>[I004650]</b></a><br />
From Wikipedia<br>
<br>
William de Braose, Fourth Lord of Bramber (1140/1150 - August 9, 1211) at his peak was also lord of Gower, Abergavenny, Brecknock, Builth, Radnor, Kington, Limerick, Skenfrith, Grosmont, and Whitecastle. His rise and fall at the hands of king John is often taken as an example of that king's arbitrary and capricious behavior towards his barons.<br>
<br>
William was the son of William de Braose, Third Lord of Bramber and Bertha of Hereford, daughter of Miles Fitz Walter, Earl of Hereford and his wife, formerly Sibyl de Neufmarche. From his father he inherited the Rape of Bramber, in Sussex, and through his mother he inherited a large estate in the Welsh Marches.<br>
<br>
In 1175, William carried out the Massacre of Abergavenny, killing several Welsh princes to avenge the death of his uncle Henry, Earl of Hereford, after having invited them to a feast at Abergavenny Castle. This resulted in great hostility against him among the Welsh, who named him the "Ogre of Abergavenny".<br>
<br>
In 1199, William fought beside King Richard the Lion-heart at Chalus, where Richard was killed.<br>
<br>
He was greatly favored by King John early in his reign. John granted him all that he might conquer from the Welsh in Radnor, gave him lordship over Limerick in Ireland (save for the city itself), possession of Glamorgan castle, and then lordship over Gower.<br>
<br>
In 1203, William was put in charge of Arthur of Brittany, whom he had personally captured the previous year. William was suspected of involvement in Arthur's disappearance, although no concrete evidence ever came to light. There is somewhat better evidence that he at least knew the truth of the matter.<br>
<br>
In 1206 John gave William the three great castles of Gwent (Skenfrith, Grosmont, and Whitecastle). At this point only an earldom separated him from the greatest in England.<br>
<br>
But soon after William fell out of favor with the king. The precise reasons remain obscure. John's stated reasons regard money de Braose owed the crown. But the king's actions went far beyond what would be necessary to recover the debt. Instead, he evidently wanted to break de Burgh, and to that end invaded Wales to seize the de Braose domains there. Beyond that, he sought de Braose's wife, who, the story goes, had made no secret of her belief that John had murdered Arthur of Brittany.<br>
<br>
De Braose fled to Ireland, then returned to Wales as John hunted him in Ireland. In Wales, William allied himself to the Welsh prince Llewelyn and helped him in rebellion against King John.<br>
<br>
In 1210, William fled in disguise to France and died the following year at Corbeil. William's wife, Maud de St. Valery, and eldest son, William, were captured and murdered by King John, possibly starved to death.<br>
<br>
While William had aroused the jealousy of the other barons during his rise, the arbitrary and violent manner of his fall very likely discomfited them and played a role in the baronial uprisings of the next decade. The historian Sidney Painter, in his biography of King John, called it "the greatest mistake John made during his reign, as the king revealed to his barons once and for all his capacity for cruelty".<br>
<br>
Eventually, William's third son, Reginald de Braose reacquired some of his father's titles and lands. The middle son, Giles, was Bishop of Hereford from 1200 until his death in 1215.<br>
<br>
William also had a daughter, Margaret, who married Walter de Lacy, Lord of Meath.<br>

Alan III DE BRETAGNE
<p>
<a name ="I008519"><b>[I008519]</b></a><br />
Alan III of Rennes (997 - October 1, 1040) was duke of Brittany, from 1008 to his death. He was son of Duke Geoffrey I and Havise of Normandy. Alan married Bertha of Blois and had at least two children: Conan II his successor, and Havise of Brittany, who married Hoel of Cornwall. He was poisoned.<br>
</p>
Geoffrey DE BRETAGNE
<p>
<a name ="I005240"><b>[I005240]</b></a><br />
He was the first to be called Duke of Brittany<br>
Married Avicia, also known as Hedwig, in 996 (when he was 16?)<br>
<br>
GEOFFREY, DUKE OF BRITTANY, married Hawise, daughter of Richard I, DUKE OF NORMANDY, and died in 1008, leaving two sons, Alan and Eudon. During their mother's lifetime the two brothers seem to have been joint rulers of Brittany, but on her death, on 21 February 1034, dissensions broke out between them; peace was restored by a settlement under which Eudon received a territory corresponding roughly to the dioceses of Dol, St. Mialo, St. Brieuc and Tr√©guier, reduced in the hands of his successors to the two last-named dioceses, while Alan retained the rest of Brittany. After the death of Alan in 1040 Eudon seized the government of Brittany to the exclusion of his nephew Conan, who recovered it in 1057. Eudon died 7 January 1079. He married Orguen, whose parentage is unknown. [Complete Peerage X:779-81, (transcribed by Dave Utzinger)]<br>
... in 1008, Geoffrey of Brittany had likewise set forth on pilgrimage to the Holy Land. [Ref: Wm Conqueror p35]<br>
On Geoffrey's departure in 1008 on the pilgrimage during which he died, his two sons Alan III and Eudo, then of tender age, were left under the tutelage of their Norman mother... [Ref: Wm Conqueror p29]<br>

Jean DE BRIENNE
<p>
<a name ="I008893"><b>[I008893]</b></a><br />
John of Brienne (c. 1148-1237), king of Jerusalem and Latin emperor-regent of Constantinople, was a man of sixty years of age before he began to play any considerable part in history.<br>
<br>
He was the second son of Erard II, count of Brienne, in Champagne. Destined originally for the Church, he had preferred to become a knight, and in forty years of tournaments and fights he had won himself a considerable reputation, when in 1208 envoys came from the Holy Land to ask Philip Augustus, king of France, to select one of his barons as husband to the heiress and ruler of the Kingdom of Jerusalem. Philip selected John of Brienne, and promised to support him in his new dignity. In 1210 John married the heiress Maria (daughter of Isabella and Conrad of Montferrat), assuming the title of king in right of his wife. In 1211, after some desultory operations, he concluded a six years' truce with Malik-el-Adil; in 1212 he lost his wife, who left him a daughter, Yolande (also known as Isabella); soon afterwards he married the Armenian princess Stephanie.<br>
<br>
In the Fifth Crusade (1218-1221) he was a prominent figure. The legate Pelagius of Albano, however, claimed the command; and insisting on the advance from Damietta, in spite of John's warnings, he refused to accept the favourable terms of the sultan, as the king advised, until it was too late. After the failure of the crusade, King John came to the West to obtain help for his kingdom. In 1223 he met Pope Honorius III and the emperor Frederick II at Ferentino, where, in order that he might be connected more closely with the Holy Land, Frederick was betrothed to John's daughter Isabella, now heiress of the kingdom. After the meeting at Ferentino, John went to France and England, finding little consolation; and thence he travelled to Santiago de Compostela, where King Alfonso IX of Leon offered him the hand of one of his daughters and the promise of his kingdom. John passed over Alfonso's eldest daughter and heiress in favor of a younger daughter, Berengaria of Castile. After a visit to Germany he returned to Rome (1225). Here he received a demand from Frederick II (who had now married Isabella) that he should abandon his title and dignity of king, which, so Frederick claimed, had passed to himself along with the heiress of the kingdom. John was now a septuagenarian "king in exile," but he was still vigorous enough to revenge himself on Frederick, by commanding the papal troops which attacked southern Italy during the emperor's absence on the Sixth Crusade (1228-1229).<br>
<br>
In 1229 John, now eighty years of age, was invited by the barons of the Latin Empire of Constantinople to become emperor-regent, on condition that Baldwin of Courtenay should marry his second daughter and succeed him. For nine years he ruled in Constantinople, and in 1235, with a few troops, he repelled a great siege of the city by John III Ducas Vatatzes, emperor of Nicaea, and Ivan Asen II of Bulgaria.<br>
<br>
After this last feat of arms, which has perhaps been exaggerated by the Latin chroniclers, who compare him to Hector and the Maccabees, John died in the habit of a Franciscan friar. An aged paladin, somewhat uxorious and always penniless, he was a typical knight errant, whose wanderings led him all over Europe, and planted him successively on the thrones of Jerusalem and Constantinople.<br>
<br>
John of Brienne married three times. By his first wife, Marie of Montferrat, he had one child, Yolande, later Queen of Jerusalem. He had also one child by his second wife, Stephanie of Armenia, a son named as successor in Armenia, but died in childhood. By his third wife, Berengaria of Castile, he had 4 children:<br>
   1. Marie de Brienne (1225-1275), who married Emperor Baldwin II of Constantinople.<br>
   2. Alphonso of Brienne (c.1228-1270), who married Marie d'Issoudon, countess of Eu, and became count of Eu in right of his wife, and was also Great Chamberlain of France.<br>
   3. John II of Brienne (c.1230-1273), who in 1258 became Grand Butler of France.<br>
   4. Louis of Acre (c.1235-1263), who married Agnes of Beaumont and became Viscount of Beaumont in her right.<br>
</p>
Gilbert DE BRIONNE
<p>
<a name ="I004679"><b>[I004679]</b></a><br />
Gilbert/Giselbert "Crispin", Count of Brionne and Eu, (ca. 1002-1040), the great progenitor of the illustrious house of Clare, of the Barons Fitz Walter, and the Earls of Gloucester and Hertford was the son of an illegitimate child of Richard the Fearless and inherited Brionne, becoming one of the most powerful landowners in Normandy. He married Gunnora d'Aunou, He had children by his wife and a mistress.<br>
    * (prob) Esilia Crispin, (b. ca. 1028), (d. ca. 1072). m. William Malet, Seigneur of Graville, (ca. 1042).<br>
    * Sir Richard Fitz Gilbert (b. ca. 1035).<br>
    * Baldwin de Clare.<br>
<br>
When Robert I, Duke of Normandy died in 1035 his illegitimate son William inherited his father's title. Several leading Normans, including Gilbert of Brionne, Osbern the Seneschal and Alan of Brittany, became William's guardians.<br>
<br>
A number of Norman barons including Raoul de Gac√© would not accept an illegitimate son as their leader. In 1040 an attempt was made to kill William but the plot failed. Gilbert however was murdered while he was peaceably riding near Eschafour. It is believed two of his killers were Ralph of Wacy and Robert de Vitot. This appears to have been an act of vengeance for wrongs inflicted upon the orphan children of Giroie by Gilbert, and it is not clear what Raoul de Gac√© had to do in the business. Fearing they might meet their father's fate, his sons Richard and his brother Baldwin were conveyed by their friends to the court of Baldwin, Count of Flanders.<br>
</p>
John DE BROCAS
<p>
<a name ="I095008"><b>[I095008]</b></a><br />
Sir John Brocas<br>
Born: circa 1298 in Gascony, Aquitaine<br>
Master of the King's Horse<br>
Died: 15th January 1365 at Clewer, Berkshire<br>
John was the eldest son of Arnold Brocas, a Gascon officer in the English army who was killed - almost certainly at the Battle of Bannockburn - in 1314. With his two brothers, Bernard and Arnold, he was brought to England, probably to Windsor, where he grew up under the protection of King Edward II.<br>
Even before he had reached full-age, he had entered the King ºs service where he acted as a valet (or squire).<br>
About 1317, while still a teenager, John married an English girl named Margaret. Not long afterwards, he was making land investments in Windsor and, probably by 1326, he had acquired the nearby manor of Clewer Brocas. The two settled down to domestic life and at least three sons and two daughters were born to them.<br>
By 1340, John was with the English army in France and seems to have given distinguished service at the Naval Battle of Sluys. He was certainly knighted shortly afterwards.<br>
Sir John became involved in King Edward ºs plans to refound King Arthur ºs Round Table, which eventually emerged as the Order of the Garter. The King had blue robes made for him both for the great tournament at Eltham and that at Lichfield. However, Sir John, nor his sons, were never made knights of the order. There may have been some prejudice against Gascons rising too high, although he probably couldn ºt have afforded the expense in any case.<br>

Beatrice DE BUILLY
<p>
<a name ="I015405"><b>[I015405]</b></a><br />
Per Weis' "Ancestral Roots . . . " (139:25), she was the eventual heiress<br>
of her brother, Roger, Lord of Tickhill.<br>
Also mentioned in Cockayne's "Complete Peerage" (EU, p.154).<br>
</p>
Elizabeth DE BURGH
<p>
<a name ="I008470"><b>[I008470]</b></a><br />
Elizabeth de Burgh, Duchess of Clarence, suo jure Countess of Ulster, born 1332, died 1363.<br>
<br>
Elizabeth was the only child of William Donn de Burgh, 3rd Earl of Ulster, and a daughter of Henry Plantagenet, 3rd Earl of Leicester. She was the last of the senior legitimate line of the descendants of William de Burgh.<br>
<br>
Upon William's murder in June 1333 she became the sole legal heir to all the de Burgh lands in Ireland. In actual fact, her kinsmen Sir Edmond Burke of Clanwilliam, Sir Edmond Albanach Bourke of Mac William Iochtar and Sir Ulick Burke of Clanricarde became the de facto heads of the family and owners of de Burgh land during the Burke Civil War 1333-38.<br>
<br>
As Duchess of Ulster she was raised in England and married her cousin Lionel of Antwerp, 1st Duke of Clarence in 1352. He was a the second son of Edward III of England and his Queen consort Philippa of Hainault.<br>
<br>
<br>
They had an only child, Philippa Plantagenet, born in 1355/ Philippa married in 1368 Edmund Mortimer, 3rd Earl of March (1351-1381). They were parents to Anne de Mortimer, grandparents to Richard Plantagenet, 3rd Duke of York and great-grandparents to Edward IV and Richard III.<br>
<br>
Elizabeth died in Dublin in 1363 during her husband's term as Governor of Ireland.<br>
</p>
Hurbert DE BURGH
<p>
<a name ="I008834"><b>[I008834]</b></a><br />
Hubert de Burgh (c. 1165 - May 12, 1243) was Earl of Kent, Justiciar of England and Ireland, and one of the most influential men in England during the reigns of John and Henry III.<br>
<br>
De Burgh came from a minor gentry family about which little is known. He was possibly a brother of William de Burgh, Governor of Limerick. He was a minor official in the household of Prince John in 1197, and became John's chamberlain the next year. He continued as John's chamberlain when the latter became king in 1199.<br>
<br>
In the early years of John's reign de Burgh was greatly enriched by royal favour, receiving the honor of Corfe in 1199 and three important castles in Gwent in 1201 (Grosmont, Skenfrith, and Llantilo). He was also sheriff of Dorset, Somerset, and Herefordshire, and castellan of Laucester and Wallingford castles.<br>
<br>
The next year de Burgh was appointed Constable of Dover Castle, and also given charge of Falaise, in Normandy. He is cited as having been appointed a Lord Warden of the Cinque Ports by 1215, and although the co-joint position of this office to that of the constableship of Dover Castle was not fully established until after the Baron's War, a rather long period seems to have elasped between the two appointments. (White and Black books of the Cinque Ports Vol XIX 1966)<br>
<br>
Now comes the part of his early career for which he is best remembered. After John captured his nephew Arthur of Brittany, niece Eleanor and their allies in 1202, de Burgh was made their jailor. There is a story (used, for example, by Shakespeare in his play King John) that the king ordered de Burgh to blind Arthur, but that de Burgh refused. The truth of this has been much doubted, however.<br>
<br>
In any case de Burgh retained the king's trust, and in 1203 was given charge of the great castle at Chinon, in Touraine, a key to the defence of the Loire valley. There de Burgh held out while the rest of the English possessions fell to the French. Chinon was besieged for a year, and finally fell in June, 1205.<br>
<br>
During the year he was trapped in Chinon, and the two following years when he was a prisoner of the French, de Burgh lost most of his estates and posts. The reasons are much debated. After his return to England in 1207, he acquired new and different lands and offices. These included the castles of Lafford and Sleaford, and the shrievalty of Lincolnshire. Probably, however, de Burgh spent most of his time in the English holdings in France, where he was seneschal of Poitiers.<br>
<br>
De Burgh remained loyal to the king during the barons' rebellions at the end of John's reign. The Magna Carta mentions him as one of those who advised the king to sign the charter, and he was one of the 25 guarantors of its execution.<br>
<br>
De Burgh played a prominent role in the defence of England from the invasion of Louis of France, the son of Philippe II who later became Louis VIII. Louis' first objective was to take Dover Castle, which was in de Burgh's charge. The castle withstood a lengthy siege in the summer and fall of 1216, and Louis withdrew. The next summer Louis could not continue without reinforcements from France. De Burgh gathered a small fleet which defeated a larger French force, and ultimately lead to the complete withdrawal of the French from England.<br>
<br>
After the death of William Marshal in 1219, de Burgh effectively became regent of England. In this position de Burgh acquired a number of enemies and rivals, who were to dog him for the rest of his life.<br>
<br>
When Henry III came of age in 1227 de Burgh was made Earl of Kent, and he remained one of the most influential people at court. But in 1232 the plottings of his enemies finally succeeded and he was removed from office and soon was in prison. Two years later, the Archbishop of Canterbury effected a reconciliation.<br>
<br>
De Burgh married three times: (1) Beatrice de Warrenne; (2) Avisa heiress of Gloucester, ex-wife of King John of England (~1217); (3) Princess Margaret of Scotland, daughter of King William I of Scotland (1221). With his third wife he had a daughter Margaret (~1226-1243), called "Megotta." She married Richard de Clare, Earl of Gloucester. Before the marriages he had a marriage contract with Joan, daughter of William de Reviers, 6th Earl of Devon, but that engagement was broken off in 1200.<br>
<br>
He had two sons, John and Hubert, by his first wife Beatrice. The former inherited de Burgh's estates but not his earldom or other titles.<br>
<br>
The relationship between Hubert de Burgh and the later de Burgh's Earl of Ulster and Lord of Connaught is not clear. They descend from William de Burgh (c.1160?-1204) but the relationship between Hubert and William, while generally believed to be true, has never being exactly verified; at most they were brothers, at the very least, cousions.<br>
</p>
Richard DE BURGH
<p>
<a name ="I008811"><b>[I008811]</b></a><br />
Richard Og de Burgh, also known as Richard de Burgh, was the 2nd Earl of Ulster, 3rd Lord of Connacht. Born about 1259, died 1326. His name, "Richard Og" meant Richard the Young, probably a reference to his youth when he became earl in 1271, or to differenciate him from his grandfather, Richard Mor. He was also known as the Red Earl.<br>
<br>
Richard Og was the most powerful of the de Burgh Earls of Ulster. He was a friend of King Edward I of England, and ranked first among the Earls of Ireland. Richard's wife Marguerite de Guines was the cousin of King Edward's queen. He pursued expansionist policies that often left him at odds with fellow Ango-Irish lords; he sucessfully defeated the King Felim mac Aedh Ua Conchobair of Connacht at the Second Battle of Athenry in 1316.<br>
<br>
His sister, Egidia de Burgh, was wife of James the Stewart of Scotland. His second son, John de Burgh, was husband to Elizabeth de Clare, a granddaughter of Edward I. Of his daughters, Catherine married the Earl of Desmond; Joan married the Earl of Kildare; Avelina married John Earl of Louth; Matilda married Gilbert de Clare, 8th Earl of Gloucester; and Elizabeth married Robert the Bruce, later Robert I of Scotland. His son John died in 1313, leaving the succession to his infant son, William.<br>
</p>
Richard DE BURGH
<p>
<a name ="I008817"><b>[I008817]</b></a><br />
Richard Mor de Burgh, eldest son of William de Burgh; born after 1294, died 1242. 1st Lord of Connacht, founder of the towns of Ballinasloe, Loughrea and Galway.<br>
</p>
Walter DE BURGH
<p>
<a name ="I008815"><b>[I008815]</b></a><br />
Walter de Burgh, born about 1220 or after, died at his castle of Galway in 1271, buried at Athassel Abbey, County Tipperary. He was 2nd Lord of Connacht and 1st Earl of Ulster. Second son of Richard Mor de Burgh. Succeded by his eldest son, Richard Og de Burgh, 2nd Earl of Ulster (The Red Earl of Ulster).<br>
<br>
</p>
William DE BURGH
<p>
<a name ="I008821"><b>[I008821]</b></a><br />
William de Burgh (c. 1160 - 1204) was born in the village of Burgh Castle, Norfolk, East Anglia, Kingdom of England and died at Athassell Abbey, Golden, County Tipperary, Munster, Ireland.<br>
<br>
William took his surname from the village of Burgh Castle, Norfolk, England. Very little can be ascertained about his background other than his family were minor gentry, and that his probable younger brother was Hubert de Burgh, later Earl of Kent.<br>
<br>
William apparently arrived in Ireland in 1184 among the retinue of Prince John of England, son of Henry II of England and Eleanor of Aquitaine.<br>
<br>
John apparently appointed him Governor of Limerick. Within a few years he was granted the manors of Kilsheeland and Ardpatrick, and in time, the castle of Tibraghty in County Kilkenny.<br>
<br>
Sometime in the 1190s, William married a daughter of Donal Mor mac Turlough O'Brian, King of Thomond (died 1194). This alliance probably took place during the reign of his son, Murtough, as up to the time of his death Donal had being at war with the Normans. At any rate no more wars are recorded between the two sides for the rest of the decade.<br>
<br>
Alliance with Connacht<br>
In 1200, "Cathal Crobderg Ua Conchobair went into Munster, to the son of Mac Carthy and William Burke to solicit their aid." This marked the start of de Burgh's interest in the province. Though King of Connacht Cathal Crobderg Ua Conchobair (reigned 1190 - 1224) faced much opposition, mainly from within his own family and wished to engage Burke's aid to help secure his position. The following year William and Ua Conchobair led an army from Limerick to Tuam and finally to Boyle. Ua Conchobair's rival, Cathal Carragh Ua Conchobair marched at the head of his army to give them battle but was killed in a combined Burke/Ua Conchobair onslaught after a week of skirmishing between the two sides.<br>
<br>
William and Ua Conchobair then travelled to Iar Connacht and stayed at Cong for Easter. Here, William and the sons of Rory O'Flaherty conspired to kill Ua Conchobair but the plot was foiled, apparently by holy oaths they were made to swear by the local Coarb family. However, when de Burgh demanded payment for himself and his retinue, battle finally broke out with over seven hundred of de Burgh's followers said to have being killed. William, however, managed to return to Limerick.<br>
<br>
Death<br>
The Annals of the Four Masters recorded his passing in 1204:<br>
"William Burke plundered Connaught, as well churches as territories; but God and the saints took vengeance on him for that; for he died of a singular disease, too shameful to be described."<br>

William DE BURGH
<p>
<a name ="I008808"><b>[I008808]</b></a><br />
William Donn de Burgh, 3rd Earl of Ulster, the "Brown Earl," (1312-1333) was the grandson of Richard Og de Burgh, 2nd Earl of Ulster via his second son John.<br>
<br>
He was murdered in 1333 and was survived by an only child, Elizabeth de Burgh, Duchess of Ulster who married Lionel of Antwerp, third son of Edward III of England.<br>
<br>
Upon the death of William Donn ("donn" is Irish for brown (hair), hence his nickname) the various factions of the de Burghs, now called Burke, began a civil war for supremacy.<br>
<br>
The factions were headed by Sir Ulick Burke, 1st Mac William Uachtar or Clanricarde (d.1353); Sir Edmond Albanach Bourke, 1st Mac William Iochtar (d.1375); and Sir Edmond de Burgh of Castleconnell (k.1338), ancestor of the Bourkes of Clanwilliam in Munster.<br>

On August 25, 1346, he served Edward III at the Battle of Crecy both as a diplomat and a soldier, as did his son. Following this battle, many nobles were ransomed, and it is clear De Burghersh was at length released as he later served the king as a Constable of Dover Castle, and Lord Warden of the Cinque Ports, like his father before him. Bartholomew Burghersh (? - August 1351), brother of bishop Henry Burghersh became Baron Burghersh on the death of his brother Stephen in 1310.<br>

<br>
"On 18th May by an inquisition taken by Bartholomew de Burghersh, Warden of the Cinque Ports, Parson Holbourne as rector of Rye was granted a place called Courton, where the pleus affecting the town are now held, adjoining the church yard and "of ancient time ordained there for a dwelling of the Parson of that church". Here was built the first Rectory House on the same site as it occupies today some 645 years later". (703 AD).<br>
<br>
