Eleanor PLANTAGENET
<p>
<a name ="I004989"><b>[I004989]</b></a><br />
From Wikipedia<br>
<br>
Eleanor of Lancaster (sometimes called Eleanor Plantagenet1) (about 1315 - 11 January 1372) was born in Arundel, West Sussex, England, the fifth daughter of Henry, Earl of Lancaster (c. 1281-1345) and his wife Maud Chaworth (1282-1322).<br>
<br>
First marriage and offspring<br>
Sometime between September 1 and November 6, 1330, she married John Beaumont, 2nd Lord Beaumont, son of Henry Beaumont, 4th Earl of Buchan (c. 1288 - 1340) and his wife Alice Comyn (c. 1291-1349). They had two children:<br>
   1. Henry Beaumont, 3rd Lord Beaumont, born late 1339<br>
   2. Matilda Beaumont (died July 1467), married Hugh de Courtenay<br>
<br>
Eleanor was a lady-in-waiting to Queen Philippa, and was in service to her in Ghent when her son Henry was born. John de Beaumont died in a tournament on 14 April 1342.<br>
<br>
Second marriage<br>
On 5 February 1344 at Ditton Church, Stoke Poges, Buckinghamshire, she married Richard Fitzalan, 10th Earl of Arundel, 4th Earl of Surrey, known by the soubriquet of "Copped Hat", Justiciar of North Wales, Governor of Carnarvon Castle, Admiral of the West.2<br>
<br>
His previous marriage, to Isabel le Despenser, had taken place when they were children. It was annulled by Papal mandate as she, since her father's attainder and execution, had ceased to be of any importance to him. The Pope obligingly annulled the marriage, bastardized the issue, and provided a dispensation for his second marriage to the woman with whom he had been living in adultery (the dispensation, dated 4 March 1344/5, was required because his first and second wives were first cousins).<br>
<br>
The children of Eleanor's second marriage were:<br>
   1. Richard (1346-1397), who succeeded as Earl of Arundel<br>
   2. John Fitzalan(bef 1349-1379)<br>
   3. Thomas Arundel, Archbishop of York (c. 1350-February 19, 1413)<br>
   4. Joan Fitzalan (bef. 1351-April 17, 1419), married Humphrey de Bohun, 7th Earl of Hereford<br>
   5. Alice Fitzalan (1352-March 17, 1416), married Thomas Holland, 2nd Earl of Kent<br>
<br>
Eleanor died at Arundel and was buried at Lewes Priory in Lewes, Sussex, England. Her husband was buried beside her; in his will Richard requests to be buried "near to the tomb of Eleanor de Lancaster, my wife; and I desire that my tomb be no higher than hers, that no men at arms, horses, hearse, or other pomp, be used at my funeral, but only five torches...as was about the corpse of my wife, be allowed."<br>

Eleanor PLANTAGENET

<a name ="I010599"><b>[I010599]</b></a><br />
From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia.<br>
<br>
Eleanor of England (also called Eleanor Plantagenet1 and Eleanor of Leicester) was born in the year 1215, in Gloucester. She was the youngest child of King John of England and Isabelle of Angouleme. John's London was conquered and Isabella was in shame. He had been forced to sign the Magna Carta. Eleanor would never see her Father, as he died at Newark Castle when she was barely a year old. The French, led by Philip II of France, were marching through the south. The only lands loyal to her brother were in the middle and southwest. The barons ruled the north, but they united with the royalists under William Marshal, 1st Earl of Pembroke, who protected the young king, and Philip was defeated.<br>
<br>
William Marshal died in 1219 and Eleanor was promised to his son, also named William. They were married on April 23, 1224 at New Temple Church in London. The younger William was 34 and Eleanor only nine. He died in London on April 6, 1231, days before their 7th anniversary. There were no children of this marriage. The widowed Eleanor swore a holy oath of chastity in the presence of Edmund Rich, Archbishop of Canterbury.<br>
<br>
Seven years later, she met Simon de Montfort, 6th Earl of Leicester. They fell in love and married secretly on January 7, 1238 at the King's chapel at Westminister Palace. Her brother King Henry later alleged that he only allowed the marriage because Simon had seduced Eleanor. The marriage was controversial because of the oath Eleanor had sworn several years before to remain chaste. Because of this, Simon made a pilgrimage to Rome seeking papal approval for their union. Simon and Eleanor would have six children:<br>
   1. Henry de Montfort (November 1238-1265)<br>
   2. Simon the younger de Montfort (April 1240-1271)<br>
   3. Amaury de Montfort, Canon of York (1242/1243-1300)<br>
   4. Guy de Montfort, Count of Nola (1244-1288)<br>
   5. A daughter, born and died in Bordeaux between 1248 and 1251.<br>
   6. Richard de Montfort (1252-1266)<br>
   7. Eleanor de Montfort (1258-1282)<br>
<br>
Simon de Montfort had the real power behind the throne, but when he tried to take the throne, he was defeated with his son at the Battle of Evesham on August 4, 1265. Eleanor fled to exile in France where she became a nun at Montargis Abbey, a nunnery founded by her dead husband's sister Amicia. She died and was buried there on April 13, 1275.<br>

Hamelin PLANTAGENET
<p>
<a name ="I004997"><b>[I004997]</b></a><br />
From Wikipedia<br>
<br>
Hamelin de Warenne (d. May 7, 1202) was an English nobleman who was prominent at the courts of the Angevin kings of England, Henry II, Richard I, and John.<br>
<br>
He was an illegitimate son of Geoffrey of Anjou, and thus a half-brother of Henry II, and an uncle of Richard I and John. His half-brother Henry gave him one of the wealthiest heiresses in England, Isabella de Warenne, in her own right Countess of Surrey. She was the widow of William of Blois. Hamelin and Isabella married on in April 1164, and after the marriage he was recognized as Earl of Warenne, that being the customary designation for what more technically should be Earl of Surrey. In consequence of the marriage Hamelin took the de Warenne toponymic, as did his descendents.<br>
<br>
Hamelin joined in the denunciations of Thomas Becket in 1164, although after Becket's death he became a great believer in Becket's sainthood, having, the story goes, been cured of blindness by the saint's help. In 1167 he escorted his niece Joan of England to Sicily for her marriage.<br>
<br>
He remained loyal to Henry through all the problems of the later part of the king's reign when many nobles deserted him, and continued as a close supporter of his nephew Richard I. During Richard's absence on the Third Crusade he took the side of the regent William Longchamp. Hamelin appeared in the 2nd coronation of King Richard in 1194 and at King John's coronation in 1199.<br>
<br>
He died in 1202 and was succeeded by his son William de Warenne, 6th Earl of Surrey. A daughter was the mistress of her cousin King John of England, and by him the mother of Richard Fitz Roy.<br>

Henry PLANTAGENET
<p>
<a name ="I005278"><b>[I005278]</b></a><br />
Henry Plantagenet, 3rd Earl of Leicester (1281 - September 22, 1345) was an English nobleman, one of the principals behind the deposition of Edward II.<br>
<br>
He was the younger son of Blanche of Artois and Edmund Crouchback, 1st Earl of Lancaster, Earl of Leicester, who was a son of Henry III of England and Eleanor of Provence.<br>
<br>
Henry's elder brother Thomas, 2nd Earl of Lancaster succeeded their father in 1296, but Henry was summoned to Parliament on February 6, 1298/99 by writ directed Henrico de Lancastre nepoti Regis, by which he is held to have become Lord Lancaster. He took part in the siege of Carlaverock in July 1300.<br>
<br>
Thomas was convicted of treason, executed and his lands and titles forfeited in 1322. But Henry, who had not participated in his brother's rebellion, petitioned for his brother's lands and titles, and on March 29, 1324 he was invested as Earl of Leicester, and a few years later the earldom of Lancaster was also restored to him.<br>
<br>
On the Queenʼs return to England with Roger Mortimer, 1st Earl of March in September 1326, Henry joined her party against Edward II, which led to a general desertion of the kingʼs cause and overturned the power of Hugh le Despenser, 1st Earl of Winchester and his namesake son Hugh the younger Despenser. He was sent in pursuit and captured the king at Neath. He was appointed to take charge of the King, and was responsible for his custody at Kenilworth Castle.<br>
<br>
After Edward II's death Henry was appointed guardian of the new king Edward III of England, and was also appointed captain-general of all the King's forces in the Scottish marches.<br>
<br>
In about the year 1330, he became blind.<br>
<br>
He was succeeded as Earl of Lancaster and Leicester by his eldest son, Henry of Grosmont, who subsequently became Duke of Lancaster.<br>
<br>
He married once, to Maud Chaworth, before 2 March 1296/1297. (Some references claim he married Alix de Joinville, but she in fact married Henry's brother John.) With Maud he had seven children:<br>
    * Henry of Grosmont, 1st Duke of Lancaster, (about 1300-1360/61)<br>
    * Blanche of Lancaster, (about 1305 - 1380)<br>
    * Maud of Lancaster, (about 1310-1377)<br>
    * Joan of Lancaster, (about 1312-1345)<br>
    * Isabel of Lancaster, Abbess of Ambresbury, (about 1317-after 1347)<br>
    * Eleanor of Lancaster, (about 1318-1371/72)<br>
    * Mary of Lancaster, (about 1320-1362), who married Henry, 3rd Baron Percy and was the mother of Henry Percy, 1st Earl of Northumberland.<br>
<br>
He was born in Grosmont Castle, Monmouthshire and died in Leicester, England. He is interred at Newark Abbey, Leicester.<br>

Margaret PLANTAGENET
<p>
<a name ="I007304"><b>[I007304]</b></a><br />
From Wikipedia<br>
<br>
Margaret Plantagenet, Margaret of Brotherton, Duchess of Norfolk (c. 1320-March 24, 1398) was Countess of Norfolk from 1338 to 1398. She was the daughter of Thomas of Brotherton, 1st Earl of Norfolk, by his first wife Alice Hayles. She became heiress to the Earldom after the death of her childless brother, Edward, in 1334.<br>
<br>
She married firstly in 1337 to Sir John de Segrave, 4th Lord Segrave by whom she had four children:<br>
   1. Edmund de Segrave, died in the cradle.<br>
   2. Elizabeth de Segrave (1338-1368)<br>
   3. John de Segrave (September 13, 1340-1349)<br>
   4. Anne de Segrave, Abbess of Barking<br>
<br>
In 1350, Margaret and John de Segrave began seeking a divorce based on the premise that they were contracted in marriage before she was of age, and that she had never consented to marry him. Furthermore, she had begun a relationship with a knight of great renown, Sir Walter Manny, 1st Baron Manny, as she crossed the channel in October 1350 to meet with him in Calais, without the king's permission. The inquisition regaring this incident shows that Margaret illegally crossed the Channel and met with Manny's servant, who broke his lantern with his foot so she could pass unnoticed.<br>
<br>
John de Segrave died in 1353, before their divorce could be finalized; the next year Margaret wed Walter Manny shortly before May 30, 1354, and they had two more children:<br>
   1. Thomas Manny, drowned in a well as a boy.<br>
   2. Anne Manny, wife of John Hastings, 2nd Earl of Pembroke<br>
<br>
Sir Walter died in 1371. Margaret never remarried, and as a widow was created Duchess of Norfolk for life in 1397, even though her grandson Thomas Mowbray, 1st Duke of Norfolk had already succeeded to the honor of Norfolk. Margaret, Duchess of Norfolk, died in 1398 and was buried in the choir of the Grey Friars, London.<br>
