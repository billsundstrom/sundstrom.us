Rev. Warren Goddard, of Brockton, one of the three oldest surviving graduates of Harvard, died Tuesday, aged 89 years. He was a native of New Hampshire and a graduate of Harvard in the class of 1818.

Mr. Goddard in age was the second oldest graduate, Mr. Farley being about three months older. The late Dr. William Goddard, who at the time of his death was the oldest survivor of the college was his brother. Seven children are now living, including J.F. Goddard, vice-president and manager of the Atchison Railroad; John Goddard, pastor of the New church in Cincinnati; Warren Goddard, practicing law in Providence; H.E.

Coel GODEBOG
<p>
<a name ="I009605"><b>[I009605]</b></a><br />
he Welsh chronicles state further that his name was Coel Hen Godhebog, which would integrate the two possible names together. Monmouth states that Coel, upset with Asclepiodotus's handling of Diocletian's massacres, began a rebellion in the duchy of Kaelcolim (Colchester), of which he was duke. He met Asclepiodotus in battle and killed him, thus taking the kingship of Britain upon himself. Rome, apparently, was thrilled that Britain had a new king and sent a senator, Constantius Chlorus, to act as a diplomat to Coel. Afraid of the Romans, Coel met Constantius and agreed to pay tribute and submit to Roman laws as long as he was allowed to retain the kingship of Britain. Constantius agreed to these terms but one month later, Coel died. Constantius took Coel's daughter, Helena, and crowned himself as Coel's successor. Helen later gave birth to a son who became Emperor Constantine the Great. Note that the Historia Regum Britanniae is not generally considered historically accurate.<br>
<br>
David Nash Ford and Peter L Kessler contend that Cole was Coel Hen, High King of Northern Britain who apparently lived around AD 350-420, during the time when the Romans withdrew their forces from Britain. He may have been the last of the Roman Duces Brittanniarum (Dukes of the Britons), and took over the northern capital at Eburacum (York) to rule over what had been the northern province of Roman Britain. Most of the Celtic British kings of north Britain, and many Welsh kings, would trace their descent from him - for example Rheged. He is considered to be the father-in-law of Cunedda, founder of the Kingdom of Gwynedd.<br>

From Wikipedia<br>
<br>
Gunther (in Latin Gundaharius and in Anglicized Old Norse Gunnar) was a king of the Burgundians west of the Rhine from at least 411 to his death in 437. Legendary tales about Gundaharius appear in Latin, medieval German, Old Norse, and Old English texts, especially concerning his relations with Siegfried (in Old Norse Sigurd) and the death of Gunther from treachery in the hall of Attila the Hun.<br>
<br>
History<br>
According to Olympiodorus, in 411 Jovinus was proclaimed tyrannos of Moundiakon in Germania Secunda through the support of the Alan Goar and of Guntiarios who was called commander of the Burgundians.<br>
<br>
After the defeat of Jovinus in 413, the Burgundians were permitted by Rome to settle in Gaul, on the Rhine and it may have been then that Gundaharius first established the Burgundian Kingdom west of the Rhine with Worms as its capital.<br>
<br>
In 435 the Burgundians attempted to thrust farther westward but were defeated by the Roman general Aetius. In 437 the Huns (perhaps with the support of Aetius) attacked and destroyed the Burgundian kingdom. Gundaharius met his death and the surviors were allowed by the Romans to settle in Savoy. Attila himself seems to have had no part in this since, at least according to Priscus, in 435 Attila was negotiating peace with Romans at Margus in upper Moesia and until 439 was occupied with subduing the nations of Scythia and warring on the Sorosgi.<br>
<br>
Gundaharius' successor was Gundioc, whose relation to Gundaharius is unknown.<br>
<br>
In the Lex Burgundionum', issued by the Burgundian king Gundobad (c. 480-516), it is decreed that those who were free under the kings Gibica, Gundomar, Gislaharius, and Gundaharius will remain free. In later Germanic legend Gunther appears directly as the son of Gibica or Gibeche/Gjúki. In German accounts his brothers are named Gernot and Giselher (all three called kings in the Nibelungenlied). Norse tradition knows of a younger brother named Gotthorm (Gotormr) which might dervie from Gundomar. This suggests that historically the king Gibica of the Bungrundian Laws might have been the father of three kings Gundomar, Gislaharius, and Gundaharius who shared the kingdom, presumably with Gundaharius being the high king. But if so, the order of the names here is puzzling. One would expect Gundaharius to be named immediately after Gibica.<br>

Rodney Goetchius dead at 83; set up satellite tracking system <br>
Services are scheduled for 4 pm. today for Rodney Goetchius, a Vero Beach resident who set up the satellite tracking system for John Glenn's orbit around the Earth in 1962. Mr. Goetchius died Saturday at the Royal Palm Convalescent Home. He was 83. As project director, Mr. Goetchius flew around the world setting up 18 satellite communication systems. In the late 1950s and early 1960s that would track and communicate with Glenn during his journey, said his son, Arnold Goetchius. After the successful launch, Mr. Goetchius was promoted to general manager for northeastern section of the United States for Bell Systems, his son said "He was a smart, very brilliant man," Goetchius said. Mr, Goetchius retired in 1966 after 43 years with the Bell Systems. He moved to Vero Beach from Madison, N.J, in 1970 where he became active in the Vero Beach Country Club and an amateur radio club. "He played golf every day of his life," said his daughter-in-law Rea Goetchius. A large antenna that was connected to a ham radio stood outside his home at 1010 Treasure Lane, she added. "He was a very calm, steady kind of man who took everything in stride," she said Mr. Goetchius never fully recovered from a stroke he suffered several years ago.
