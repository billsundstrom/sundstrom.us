Donald Walter MILLER
<p>
<a name ="I024197"><b>[I024197]</b></a><br />
Donald Walter Miller November 8, 2021 In the early morning hours of Monday, November 8, 2021, Don passed away peacefully at Cayuga Medical Center in Ithaca, NY after battling sepsis. He was surrounded by his family whom he cherished. His strong will to live and the love, support and prayers of family and friends helped Don survive a massive stroke 14 years prior and lead a full life. Don was born at Syracuse General Hospital on May 16, 1928. He was the only child of Walter Seymour Miller and Martha Louise (nee Schweitzer) Miller. Don grew up in the Tipperary Hill area of Syracuse surrounded by his numerous Schweitzer cousins. He was both baptized and confirmed at St. Paul's Lutheran Church. He graduated from Central High School in 1946 and enrolled in the New York State College of Forestry at Syracuse University. Don's professional career began in the GE apprentice program in Syracuse and in 1955 he moved to GE's Advanced Electronics Center in Ithaca, NY. It was in Ithaca that he met his future wife, June Beverly Nelson of Tonawanda, NY. They married on June 30, 1956 in Anabel Taylor Chapel at Cornell. Don continued to work for GE until 1965 when he became the chief designer at the Laboratory of Nuclear Studies at Cornell University with design responsibilities for the mechanical and electrical equipment for the development and construction of Cornell's Wilson Synchrotron. Throughout his 40 years of dedicated service at Cornell, Don wore several different hats in the laboratory including architect/engineer, technical supervisor, and head of publications/archives. Don enjoyed teaching others and in the mid-70s also served as an adjunct professor of drafting at Tompkins Cortland Community College. He also started his own company, DWM Graphics, which provided drafting and illustration support for various companies. As busy as Don was professionally, there was always time for his family. He was a proud husband, father and grandfather and was always happy to share stories about his family. Don was a storyteller, both tall and true, and amused all who would listen with antics of his youth. Don's best self was not so much in his accomplishments, as many as there were, but rather in the way he interacted with the people he came to know. His humor, caring, and willingness to be involved endeared Don to many throughout the community. Don was a lifelong Boy Scout and started his Scouting journey in 1940 at the age of 12. He was an Eagle Scout, Vigil Honor member of the Order of the Arrow, Wood Badge recipient and an avid outdoorsman. Don shared his love of the outdoors and Scouting with countless youth for over 45 years, as a Cub Master, Scout Master of Troop 6 in Ithaca and Merit Badge Counselor. In recognition of his exceptional character and distinguished service to the Baden-Powell Council, Don was awarded the Silver Beaver Award. Don's other passion was folk and square dancing which he began in the late 40's and shared with his wife. For much of his life, Don could be found throughout Central New York teaching folk dance and calling square dances. He called square dances at elementary schools, through Cornell Outing Club, at Cornell's Freshman Orientation, weekly during Cornell's summer session and was a judge for the 4H square dancing competition at the NYS Fair. If his children were involved in something, so was Don. He served as PTA co-president with his wife at South Hill Elementary School and President of the Ithaca High School Band Boosters, attending every football game and band competition and serving as a frequent chaperone. Don was an active member of St. John's Episcopal Church, a member of the Order of DeMolay and the Liverpool Lodge of the Masonic Fraternity. Don fully embraced the role of Grandfather and was blessed to have three grandchildren. He enjoyed attending their music, theater and sporting events and spending time with them whenever possible. Don was preceded in death by his parents, his half-brother, Eugene H. Miller and his loving wife of 60 years, June B. Miller (nee Nelson). Don is survived by his son, Scott A. Miller (Kristen Park) of Dryden, NY, his daughter, Christine Miller Whaley (Harry E. Whaley) of Chester Springs, PA and his daughter, Diane June Miller of Ithaca, NY. Don is also survived by his beloved grandchildren: Cameron A. Park-Miller, Emma L. Park-Miller, Harry Nelson Whaley, and several nieces and nephews. Calling Hours will be held on Saturday, November 13, 2021, from 4:00 p.m. to 6:00 p.m. at Bangs Funeral Home, 209 W. Green Street, Ithaca, NY.

(VII) Edwin Cyrus, son of Edwin Ford Miller, was born at Haydenville, May 10, 1867. He attended the public schools of his native village and the Wesleyan Academy of Wilbraham, where he was graduated in the class of 1882. Later he studied horticulture and pomology under Professor John Craig, of Cornell University, one of the foremost authorities on these subjects. From 1889 to 1896 he was a clerk in the First National Bank of Northampton. Since 1896 he has been associated with his father on the homestead, "Hillside Farm," and lives in the house built by his grandfather. Besides the famous orchard, the farm has a model dairy. His practical and theoretical knowledge of fruit raising has been put into useful practice, not only on the homestead which has become a model for the orchards of New England apple growers, but as a consulting orchardist and institute lecturer. The farm produces an average yield of three thousand barrels of apples, and has some three thousand trees, old and young. Mr. Miller believes that ample proof has been given that apples require plenty of air and sunshine and that high ground is best adapted for growing apples in New England. Much of the Miller orchard is quite hilly, as the name implies. He is a regular contributor to the various agricultural and horticultural publications, including The Homestead, The New England Farmer, The American Cultivator, The Greens Fruit Grower, The Fruit Grower of St. Joseph, Missouri, The Fruit Trade Journal, Better Fruit of Hood River and to the Springfield Sunday Republican. He is president of the Hampshire-Franklin Fruit Growers Association, and member of the Massachusetts Horticultural Society, and the American Pomological Association. For his lectures Mr. Miller has large photographs of orchards illustrating the points he is to make and when a lantern is available he uses the stereopticon. He lectures on all the phases of orchard management from setting out the trees to marketing the crop. His pictures are said to be the finest of the kind in the country. Of his lectures in the Maine Farmers' institutes the New York Tribune Farmer says: "He not only dwelt upon the essentials of the business from the selection and preparation of the soil to the time the finished product is placed upon the tables of the consumers in a manner that left every point clear in the minds of his hearers, but by his earnestness, sincerity and enthusiasm, as well as the fact that he has shown by his acts that he has faith in the business, he imparted a desire to strive for the high ideals he has set for himself to every person in his audiences. Maine farmers have long ago tired of listening to the man who works from theories alone and who builds fancy pictures about an imaginary business into which he never had courage to put his capital or the faith to put his future, and when a man like Mr. Miller comes among them he is sure of their attention. Everyone who heard him will, from that time on, be better equipped for the work he may be doing, and will have a lifelong interest in the work being done at Hillside Orchards on the hills of Massachusetts." Of the orchards of Hillside Farm, the Horthampton Herald said recently: "These apple orchards are reputed to be among the very finest in New England, if not the best - considering the care it is given in every detail of first-class fruit production, picking and packing and the alertness, celerity and persistency with which the owners perceive, adopt and carry out the most approved horticultural methods." Mr. Miller married, at Northampton, June 17, 1891, Edith Dunbar Childs, born at Northampton, December 5, 1867, daughter of Henry and Esther (Kinsley) Childs. Children: I. Charlotte, born at Northampton, October 27, 1895. 2. Gladys, born at Haydenville, May 5, 1902. <br>

(VI) Edwin Ford, son of Cyrus (2) Miller, was born at Haydenville, a village in the town of Williamsburg, May 3, 1837, on the Miller homestead. Though his schooling was limited to that of the district schools, he was always fond of reading and inclined to be studious. He is especially well versed in the history of his native town and county, has a wonderful fund of general information and is a gifted conversationalist. He possesses a large and well-selected library. Early in life he began to take an interest in the growing of fruit, especially of apples. The orchard, for which his farm has been famous for more than two generations, was started by his grandfather from seed brought from Wallingford, Connecticut, but the fruit was of native stock and much of it unmarketable. The son traveled far and near to learn what was then known of apple growing and finally, at the suggestion of Professor Norton, began to graft the trees with new or better varieties of apples. The orchard was enlarged, and the business of apple raising became profitable. Edwin Ford Miller and his son have kept pace with the progress of science applied to apple culture, and year by year has proved the value of the new methods and scientific treatment of apple trees. Mr. Miller is still in active life and takes rank among the most prominent and successful farmers of the county. His farm includes three hundred acres, a portion of which is a part of the original Miller homestead. In his youth he learned the trade of blacksmith and made horseshoes during the winter season for a number of years, when all the enterprising farmers of New England followed a trade in addition to their farmwork. He has always taken an interest in public affairs, though independent in politics, and has been selectman several years. He is also a trustee of several public trust funds and has been for many years a trustee of the Hayden School Fund. He and his wife are faithful and consistent members of the Congregational .church of Haydenville, of which he has been a teacher in the Sunday school most of the time for the past fifty years. He married, at Spring- field, Massachusetts, June 13, 1861, Ellen Mercy Woodburn, born at Windham, Vermont, Au- gust 28, 1840, daughter of Samuel D. and Laura (Fay) Woodburn. (See Fay and Woodburn families herewith). Mr. and Mrs. Miller are devoted to each other and he attributes much of his success to her good judgment and co-operation. Their only child is Edwin Cyrus, mentioned below. <br>
