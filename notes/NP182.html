He attended Decorah Schools, where he was active in all sports, and he graduated with the class of 1950. He then started at Luther College and entered the U.S. Army Aug. 29, 1952. He was honorably discharged as a Sergeant May 29, 1954. He then returned to Luther and graduated with the class of 1956. While at Luther, Roger played on the golf team and served as Coach while also playing his last two years.<br>
He was united in marriage to Roberta Ann Olson Aug. 2, 1955 at First United Methodist Church in Decorah. This union was blessed with three children: Scott, Jill and Fay.<br>

Arnulf I of FLANDERS
<p>
<a name ="I005403"><b>[I005403]</b></a><br />
From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia.<br>
<br>
Arnulf I of Flanders (c.890-March 27, 965), known as Arnulf the Great, was the third count of Flanders.<br>
<br>
Arnulf was the son of count Baldwin II of Flanders and Ælfthryth, daughter of Alfred the Great. He was named after his distant ancestor, Saint Arnulf of Metz; this was intended to emphasize his family's descent from the Carolingian royal house.<br>
<br>
Arnulf greatly expanded Flemish rule to the south, taking all or part of Artois, Ponthieu, Amiens, and Ostravent. He exploited the conflicts between Charles the Simple and Robert I of France, and later those between Louis IV and his barons.<br>
<br>
In his southern expansion Arnulf inevitably had conflict with the Normans, who were trying to secure their northern frontier. This led to the 942 murder of the Duke of Normandy, William Longsword, at the hands of Arnulf's men.<br>
<br>
The Viking threat was receding during the later years of Arnulf's life, and he turned his attentions to the reform of the Flemish government.<br>
<br>
In 934 he married Adèle (Attala) of Vermandois, daughter of Heribert II of Vermandois. Their children were:<br>
   1. Baldwin III of Flanders<br>
   2. Luitgard, married Wichmann, Count of Ghent<br>
   3. Egbert, died 953<br>
   4. Elftrude, married Siegfried, Count of Guines<br>
<br>
Arnulf made his eldest son and heir Baldwin III of Flanders co-ruler in 958, but Baldwin died untimely in 962, so Arnulf was succeeded by Baldwin's infant son, Arnulf II of Flanders.<br>
</p>
Arnulf II of FLANDERS
<p>
<a name ="I005399"><b>[I005399]</b></a><br />
Arnulf II of Flanders (960 or 961 - March 30, 988) was Count of Flanders from 965 until his death.<br>
<br>
He was the son of Baldwin III of Flanders and Matilda of Saxony. Baldwin III died in 962, when Arnulf was just an infant, and with Arnulf's grandfather count Arnulf I of Flanders still alive. When Arnulf I died three years later (965), the regency was held by their kinsman Baldwin Balso.<br>
<br>
By the time Arnulf attained his majority in 976, Flanders had lost some of the southern territory acquired by Arnulf I. The latter had given some parts of Picardy to King Lothar of France to help assure his grandson's succession, and gave Boulogne as a fief to another relative. Then early in Arnulf's minority Lothar had taken Ponthieu and given it to Hugh Capet, and the first counts of Guines had established themselves.<br>
<br>
He married Rozala of Lombardy, daughter of Berengar II of Italy, and was succeeded by their son, Baldwin IV.<br>
</p>
Baldwin I of FLANDERS
<p>
<a name ="I005405"><b>[I005405]</b></a><br />
Baldwin I of Flanders (d. 879), also known as Baldwin Iron Arm, was the first count of Flanders.<br>
<br>
Baldwin was the son of Odacre, and had been created first count of Flanders in 862. Baldwin rose to prominence when he eloped with Judith, daughter of Charles the Bald. (Judith had previously been married to Ethelwulf and his son Ethelbald, kings of Wessex.) Charles was not pleased, and he had Baldwin excommunicated. Baldwin responded by traveling to Rome to plead his case to Pope Nicholas I. When this was granted Charles relented and accepted the marriage. To give Baldwin proper status, Charles made him count of Ghent. In the following years Baldwin was also given the counties of Ternois and Flanders.<br>
</p>
Baldwin II of FLANDERS
<p>
<a name ="I005404"><b>[I005404]</b></a><br />
Baldwin II of Flanders (c. 865 -September 10, 918), nicknamed Calvus (the Bald) was the second count of Flanders. He was also hereditary abbot of St. Bertin from 892 till his death.<br>
<br>
He was the son of Baldwin I of Flanders and Judith, a daughter of Charles the Bald.<br>
<br>
The early years of Baldwin's rule were marked by a series of devastating Viking raids. Little north of the Somme was untouched. Baldwin recovered, building new fortresses and improving city walls, and taking over abandoned property, so that in the end he held far more territory, and held it more strongly, than had his father. He also took advantage of the conflicts between Charles the Simple and Odo, Count of Paris to take over the Ternois and the Boulonnias.<br>
<br>
In 884 Baldwin married Aelfthryth (Ælfthryth, Elftrude, Elfrida), a daughter of King Alfred the Great of England. The marriage was motivated by the common Flemish-English opposition to the Vikings, and was the start of an alliance that was a mainstay of Flemish policy for centuries to come.<br>
<br>
He died at Blandimberg and was succeeded by his eldest son Arnulf I of Flanders. His younger son Adalulf was the first count of Boulogne.<br>
</p>
Baldwin III of FLANDERS
<p>
<a name ="I005401"><b>[I005401]</b></a><br />
Baldwin III of Flanders (940 - January 1, 962) was count of Flanders together with his father Arnulf I. He died before his father and was succeeded by his infant son Arnulf II, with his father acting as regent until his own death.<br>
<br>
Arnulf I had made Baldwin co-ruler in 958. During his short rule, Baldwin established the weaving and fulling industry in Ghent thus laying the basis for the economical importance of the county in the centuries to come.<br>
<br>
In 961 Baldwin married Mathilde of Saxony, by whom he had a son and heir Arnulf II.<br>
</p>
Baldwin IV of FLANDERS
<p>
<a name ="I005397"><b>[I005397]</b></a><br />
Baldwin IV of Flanders (980 - May 30, 1036), known as the Bearded, was Count of Flanders from 988 until his death. He was the son of Arnulf II of Flanders.<br>
<br>
Baldwin turned his attentions to the east and north, leaving the southern part of his territory in the hands of his vassals the counts of Guines, Hesdin, and St. Pol.<br>
<br>
To the east was Lotharingia, and here Baldwin took Valenciennes, the Cambresis, and Hainaut. It was not until 1056, during the minority of the Emperor Henry IV, then he fully secured this territory, which was then recognized as fier held of the emperor.<br>
<br>
In the more central and northerly parts of Flanders, the count's supremacy was unchallenged. Here there was a great deal of internal reclamation and colonization of marshland, all of which belonged to the counts of Flanders.<br>
<br>
Baldwin first married Ogive of Luxemburg, by whom he had a son and heir Baldwin V. He later married Eleanor of Normandy, daughter of Richard II of Normandy, by whom he had a daughter Judith. Before Baldwin she had been married to Duke Welf of Bavaria. Their daughter Judith was married toTostig Godwinson, Earl of Northumberland.(*) These widespread family connections demonstrate the political interests of the Flemish counts, both in England to the west and in Germany to the east.<br>
</p>
Baldwin V of FLANDERS
<p>
<a name ="I005395"><b>[I005395]</b></a><br />
Entered into hostilities with Emperor Otho II and acquired from that Monarch Valenciennes and the Isles of Zealand. He subsequently further increased his territories by another rich accession, that of the citadel of Ghent. - Brian Tompsett<br>
<br>
From Wikipedia<br>
<br>
Baldwin V of Flanders (d. September 1, 1067) was Count of Flanders from 1036 until his death.<br>
<br>
He was the son of Baldwin IV of Flanders, who died in 1035. He, in turn, is a descendant of Elfrida (d. 949), daughter of Alfred the Great, Saxon King of England.<br>
<br>
In 1028 Baldwin married Adela (Alix), daughter of King Robert II of France; at her instigation he rebelled against his father but in 1030 peace was sworn and the old count continued to rule until his death. From 1060 to 1067 he was the guardian for his nephew-by-marriage Philip I of France.<br>
<br>
Baldwin and Adela had four children:<br>
    * Baldwin VI, 1030-1070<br>
    * Matilda, c.1031-1083 who married William the Conqueror<br>
    * Robert I of Flanders, c.1033-1093<br>
    * Henry of Flanders c.1035<br>
</p>
Baldwin VI of FLANDERS
<p>
<a name ="I007973"><b>[I007973]</b></a><br />
Baldwin VI of Flanders (1030 - July 17, 1070) was briefly Count of Flanders, from 1067 to 1070. He was also (as Baldwin I) count of Hainaut from 1051 to 1070.<br>
<br>
He was the eldest son of Baldwin V of Flanders and Adela Capet, a daughter of king Robert I of France.<br>
<br>
In 1051 he married Richilda, widow of count Hermann I of Hainaut. Flanders had taken control of Hainaut, but it was only by this marriage that possession was really secured.<br>
<br>
Baldwin's early death left Flanders and Hainaut in the hands of his young son Arnulf III, with Richilda as regent. The countship was soon usurped by Baldwin's brother Robert the Frisian, who became count Robert I of Flanders. The young Arnulf III was killed the next year at the Battle of Cassel, and Baldwin's younger son eventually became Baldwin II of Hainaut.<br>
</p>
Margaret II of FLANDERS
<p>
<a name ="I008354"><b>[I008354]</b></a><br />
From Wikipedia<br>
<br>
Margaret II of Flanders (1202-1278) was countess of Flanders from 1244 to 1278 and countess of Hainaut from 1244 to 1246. Her coat of arms was "Chevronny or and sable".<br>
<br>
Biography<br>
She was the younger daughter of Baldwin I of Constantinople, who was also count of Flanders and Hainaut, and Marie of Champagne. He left on the Fourth Crusade before she was born, and her mother left two years later, leaving Margaret and her older sister Jeanne in the guardianship of their uncle Philip of Namur.<br>
<br>
After her mother died in 1204, and her father the next year, the now-orphaned Margaret and her sister remained under Philip's guardianship until 1208, when he gave their wardship to King Philip II of France.<br>
<br>
In 1212 Margaret married Bouchard d'Avesnes, a prominent Hainaut nobleman. This was apparently a love match, though it was approved by Margaret's sister Jeanne, who had herself recently married. The two sisters subsequently had a falling out over Margaret's share of their inheritance, which led Jeanne to attempt to get Margaret's marriage dissolved. She alleged that the marriage was invalid, and without much inspection of the facts of the case Pope Innocent III condemned the marriage, though he did not formally annul it.<br>
<br>
Bourchard and Margaret continued as a married couple, having two children, as their conflict with Jeanne grew violent and Bouchard was captured and imprisoned in 1219. He was released in 1221 on the condition that the couple separate and that Bouchard get absolution from the pope. While he was in Rome, Jeanne convinced Margaret to re-marry, this time to William of Dampierre, a nobleman from Champagne.<br>
<br>
This situation caused something of a scandal, for the marriage was possibly bigamous, and violated the church's strictures on consanguinity as well. The disputes regarding the validity of the 2 marriages and the legitimacy of her children by each husband continued for decades, becoming entangled in the politics of the Holy Roman Empire.<br>
<br>
In 1246 king Louis IX of France, acting as an arbitrator, gave the right to inherit Flanders to the Dampierre children, and the rights to Hainaut to the Avesnes children. This would seem to have settled the matter, but in 1253 problems arose again. The eldest son, John d'Avesnes was uneasy about his rights, convinced William II, Count of Holland to seize Hainaut and the parts of Flanders which were within the bounds of the empire. William of Holland was, as emperor-elect, overlord for these territories, and also John's brother-in-law. A civil war followed, which ended when the Avesnes forces defeated and imprisoned the Dampierres at the Battle of Walcheren.<br>
</p>
Robert I of FLANDERS
<p>
<a name ="I007985"><b>[I007985]</b></a><br />
Robert I of Flanders, known as Robert the Frisian, was count of Flanders from 1070 to 1092.<br>
<br>
He was the younger son of Baldwin V of Flanders and Adela (Alix) Capet, a daughter of King Robert II of France.<br>
<br>
Robert was originally intended to secure the northern borders of Flanders by his marriage to Gertrude of Holland, but after his brother's death in 1070 he displaced his nephews and became count of Flanders.<br>
<br>
By Gertrude of Holland he had 5 children:<br>
    * Robert II of Flanders<br>
    * Adela (d.1115), who first married king Canute IV of Denmark, and was the mother of Charles the Good, later count of Flanders. She then married Roger Borsa, duke of Apulia.<br>
    * Gertrude, who married Thierry II, Duke of Lorraine, and was the mother of Thierry of Alsace, also later count of Flanders<br>
    * Philip of Loo, whose illegitimate son William of Ypres was also a claimant to the county of Flanders<br>
    * Ogiva, abbess of Messines<br>

Larry Lee FLEMING
<p>
<a name ="I052738"><b>[I052738]</b></a><br />
Teacher, composer, church choir master Larry Fleming dies<br>
Larry Fleming directed church choirs, which is like saying Mickey Mantle swung a bat. In both cases, the words don't do justice.<br>
Fleming was a driving purist who made the singing voice define and embellish sacred themes. By the time he retired, in 1999, he had earned a reputation in the Twin Cities as an extraordinary teacher and creative talent, who founded the nationally renowned National Lutheran Choir in 1986.<br>
''He was a relentless perfectionist,'' said David Cherwien, the choir's current director. ''He knew what he was after, and he hung in there until it happened.<br>
''Some people used to get frustrated'' with the process, Cherwien said, ''but in the end they'd be grateful - his heart was so huge.''<br>
Fleming , 67, died last Wednesday in Peoria, Ariz., from respiratory problems. Services will be held at 10:30 a.m. Saturday at Bethlehem Lutheran Church, 4100 Lyndale Av. S., Minneapolis. Visitation will begin at 9:30.<br>
A native Montanan, Fleming graduated from Concordia College in Moorhead, Minn., in 1960, having started school on a $50 music scholarship. He became music director at University Lutheran Church of Hope in Minneapolis, with a 65-member choir in his charge. Also during this time, Fleming taught music and liturgy at what is now Luther Seminary in St. Paul and served as an editorial consultant for Augsburg Publishing House in Minneapolis.<br>
Several of his original compositions and his arrangements of traditional pieces were published by Augsburg's Fortress division. His arrangement of ''Give Me Jesus'' became a top-seller.<br>
Ryan French, marketing manager of Augsburg Fortress, said Fleming ''would take a song, maybe passed down by oral tradition, and arrange it for a four-part choir, make it accessible to a national audience.''<br>
Fleming created distinctive work, French said.<br>
''There's something about his original pieces. They have an ethereal quality,'' French said.<br>
Fleming taught music in colleges for 20 years, including his alma mater, Concordia (1976-'79) and Augsburg College of Minneapolis (1979-'86). While at Augsburg he earned his Ph.D. in musicology and music theory at the University of Minnesota.<br>
Fleming left Augsburg to start the 60-member National Lutheran Choir, with singers from a 200-mile radius of the Twin Cities. Locally he was also known for putting together the advent vespers during the Christmas season.<br>
''The choral tone he produced was like silk,'' Cherwien said.<br>
Fleming was fond of wearing a sweatshirt inscribed with his favorite words for choir members who might question his direction: Trust me.<br>
He is survived by his wife, Diane, of Spokane, Wash.; sons Martin, of Lake Chelan, Wash., and Matthew of Seattle, and a daughter, Melanie, of Lebanon, N.H. His mother, Francis Rubilotta, of Peoria, Ariz., also survives, along with four grandchildren.<br>
