Translated by google<br>
Erik Elemalm has died after a period of failing health at the age of 96 years. He was born in Svanstein where he also received his basic schooling. In 1938-1942 he was employed by the Armed Forces at I 19 in Boden where he went through the main schools. He also went through the second distribution reserve reserve officer course at Jämtland's field owner regiment I 5 in Östersund, in 1943 he was promoted to reserve sub-officer at I 19 in Boden.<br>
He was hired in 1943 at the Customs office in Haparanda border county district with various posts at the border with Finland and Norway. After the reorganization, he served, inter alia, in Övertorneå,<br>
Pello, Riksgränsen, Pajala, Karesuando and Kiruna-Arjeplog which covered most of Norrbotten. He experienced World War II in 1939-1945 with the Germans 'return to Norway via, among other things, the Swedish Tornedalen valley with evacuation and total destruction of our Finnish neighbors' homes.<br>
In Juoksengi, he, together with two colleagues and a local resident, liberated 45 people from Ratasjärvi, captured by the Germans, using a rowing boat. One of these people, a cousin, honored Erik with his presence on his 90th birthday. This event, along with the experiences during these years, made its mark in the commitment Erik had for people.<br>
Erik had a number of assignments. He participated in Övertorneå City Council for three periods. He has also been a committee member in the Haparanda district court. This mission gave him insight into the area of ??law that was impressed by. He was also helpful with various writing issues that people requested. He was a member of the Swedish Customs Association and the chairman of Norrbotten's Eastern FBU union.<br>
Erik had a great interest in moose hunting and was for many years chairman of Juoksengi southern hunting club. He was a member of Lions.<br>
In 1951 he built houses and settled in Juoksengi together with Eva, who died in 1997.<br>
Erik thrived in nature, participated in, among other things, mountain marches. Together with their brother-in-law Bror, they each built a summer cottage in Nivaranta where he spent a lot of time. He kept himself in the latter informed about what happened in the world and the Tornedalen. His knowledge of the Tower Valley, industry establishments, politics, people of his own and other families.<br>
Erik was a companion who was always involved and was characterized by great hospitality, which we have had to take part of.<br>
Erik was a wonderful talented speaker at anniversaries and funerals. When my mother Astrid, born Taavo, passed away in 2000, he and his brother-in-law Folke made a train journey to Lysekil. Erik kept a warm and nice speech. We cannot say in words how we appreciated their long journey to be with us this time. The family meant a lot to Erik and he had a lot to tell about the genera Suup and Taavo. With Erik's death, I no longer have any of the older generation in Tornedalen. However, there are many memories left.<br>
He leaves four children Christina, Christer, Lars-Eric and Per-Eric with families<br>

From Wikipedia<br>
<br>
Elfrida (945-1000, also Ælfthryth or Elfthryth) was the second wife of King Edgar of England.<br>
<br>
Her father was Earl Ordgar, Alderman of Devon. Before marrying King Edgar, Elfrida was the wife of Ethelbald, Alderman of the East Angles. Edgar had slain Ethelbald, in order to obtain the hand of his widow; and Elfrida appears to have connived at the crime.<br>
<br>
Elfrida was also party to the murder of her step son Edward the Martyr at her residence in Corfe Castle on March 18, 978. This was to place her 10-year-old son Ethelred on the throne as King Ethelred II of England. Henry of Huntingdon relates:<br>
<br>
    "[Edward] was treasonably slain by his own family... it is reported that his stepmother, that is the mother of King Ethelred, stabbed him with a dagger while she was in the act of offering him a cup to drink."<br>

From Wikipedia<br>
<br>
Rhodri the Great a.k.a. Roderick the Great (in Welsh, "Rhodri Mawr") (c. 820-878) was the first ruler of Wales to be called "Great", and the first to rule most of present-day Wales.<br>
<br>
The son of Merfyn Frych, he inherited the principality of Gwynedd on his father's death in 844, and Powys from his uncle. He proceeded to marry Angharad, daughter of the ruler of Seisyllwg, which he duly inherited on the accidental death of his brother-in-law in 871.<br>
<br>
Rhodri succeeded in holding off both Viking and Saxon invaders, offering security to his subjects at a time of great danger and unrest throughout the British Isles. It was, however, the Vikings who drove Rhodri away from his home territory in 877, and he fled to Ireland. Returning the following year in an attempt to regain his kingdom, he was killed in battle against the Mercians of Ceolwulf II. Rhodri slew Gorm, a famous Norse viking leader, during a battlefield duel, and shortly afterwards wiped out his army; the slaying of Gorm sent shockwaves across the contemporary Norse world.<br>
