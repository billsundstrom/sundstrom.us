Farmer opposed Amax to preserve land<br>
By RICK JILLSON, Warrick columnist<br>
October 22, 2004<br>
<br>
In a barren pit due south of Elberfeld and west of Chandler, not too far from what remains of Millersburg, lies a mechanized carcass with "Amax" painted on the side of its rusted shovel. Like a sunken ship deemed too cumbersome and pointless to be raised, this massive artifact sits abandoned in a hole of its own making, a tangible reminder of a Warrick County history clouded with coal dust, leveled buildings and disrupted lives.<br>
"There used to be several churches and businesses out here," recalls Alan Fehd, who grew up on his late father Elmer Fehd's dairy farm about two miles southwest of Millersburg. Today Fehd and his wife, Val, live on a 14-acre parcel of beautifully wooded land across from Alan's boyhood home. "When I was a kid there was Horn's Garage. And Murphy's Machine Shop was a mile south," Fehd said. "And there was a general store in Millersburg and Elmer's Tavern, which plenty of folks can tell you stories about."<br>
Fehd went to school in Millersburg until the mid-1960s, when the Amax Ayrshire Mine reduced much of the town to a series of hills and pits. He finished high school in Chandler. Yet the mining wasn't limited to Millersburg. Amax trucks and shovels cut through thousands of acres throughout northeastern Warrick County, including Heim Road, west of Chandler, where Elmer Fehd once owned 40 acres of farmland.<br>
"Dad owned land down in the bottoms on Heim Road - right where the mining started," Fehd said. Elmer sold the mineral rights to his Heim Road acreage to a speculator shortly after the Great Depression, when money was scarce. The developer later sold those rights to Amax.<br>
What the elder Fehd refused to part with, though, was his 200-plus-acre Hoosier Homestead family farm. Along with three other neighboring families and a nearby church, he stubbornly refused to budge.<br>
"Basically they mined in a big horseshoe around us," Alan said with a smile. "Dad's philosophy was, he was a caretaker of the land, not the owner. I don't believe he ever regretted his decision (not to sell)."<br>
Right up until his passing in 1996, Elmer Fehd was more than a proud farmer who stood his ground. He was a watchdog who held Amax accountable while it was actively mining in the area (until the late 1980s), and during the reclamation process, which extended into the mid-'90s.<br>
"Dad was responsible for keeping a lot of the roads around here open and getting them re-opened," Fehd said. "He made sure (Amax) was accountable." When Alan built his home in 1992, reclamation work was still going on around him and very few people lived nearby.<br>
That began to change in 1997, when Tri-State developer Tom Newmaster bought 6,235 acres of former Ayrshire Mine land. A number of homes have popped up since on the property Newmaster bought, and many more lots are for sale. Houses, from middle-class models to more affluent designs, now dominate several of the once-desolate roads surrounding Alan and Val's land.<br>
All of this development leads one to wonder: Do these newcomers realize the significance of that rusted shovel at the intersection of St. John's and Gander roads? Do they understand and appreciate how hard Elmer Fehd and people like him worked to safeguard the land they now call home?<br>
"I guess I'd just as soon see it wild and undeveloped like it used to be," said Alan with a shrug. "But it's certainly better than seeing it developed commercially."<br>
