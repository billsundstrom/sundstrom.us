Mrs. Evelyn Sutliffe, 18, mother of a three-month-old son, died of heart failure yesterday after crossing the narrow foot bridge high above Rexford Falls Gorge near Sherburne [Chenango Co., NY].  Out riding with her sister-in-law, Mrs. Dolores Sutliffe, and their children, the young mother left the others in the parked car south of the falls, and crossed over the high land bridge to buy soft drinks at the Gager lunch stand.  She never got to the stand.  Three schoolboys found her body at the north edge of the bridge just outside the turnstile.  her hands still clutched a dollar bill.  The three boys, Robert Ingraham, Bert Reynolds and James Lewis, called Sherburne police chief Thomas Favaloro.  Chief Favaloro called Sheriff Frank J. Machio in Norwich, who got Dr. Leslie T. Kinney, coroner, and went to Sherburne.  Meanwhile, the grief husband, Charles Sutliffe, an employee of Webb & Son Lumber co., other relative and Dr. D.U. Gould, coroner, arrived at the falls. The body was removed to the Benedict & Fox Funeral Home where Dr Kinney, Dr. Gould and Dr.  H.H. Epstein performed an autopsy last night.  Dr. Gould issued a coroner's verdict of natural death due to acute cardiac dilatation.  Surviving, besides her husband and her son, William, are her parents, Mr. and Mrs. George Wyman and several brothers and sisters, all of Brookfield.  Funeral services will be at 2 p.m. Sunday at the Benedict & Fox Funeral Home. Burial will be in Union Valley Cemetery.<br>

Robin M. WYMAN
<p>
<a name ="I103819"><b>[I103819]</b></a><br />
Robin M. Hadley, 62, entered into eternal rest on Monday, October 1, 2018, unexpectedly at Faxton-St. Lukeʼs Medical Center, with the love and support of her husband, Paul, and family, by her side.<br>
Robin was born on December 19, 1955 in Utica, the daughter of the late George & Dawn Risley Wyman. Robin grew up in the Waterville and North Brookfield area and attended Waterville Central School. She grew up in a large family, and at an early age was a care giver to many of her siblings. Her life long career was that of "mom," and caregiver to many as a homemaker and childcare provider.<br>
In 1990 Robin met her soulmate and on May 17, 2003, married her loving husband, Paul H. Hadley. Their union created a blended caring and loving family. Robin had a zest for life, and her love for all, especially her husband and family, that knew no boundaries. Her sense of humor was ever present, sharp, and she never missed a chance to add her own unique one-liner. Holidays were important to Robin, especially, Christmas. She was a super proud "Nana," who enjoyed having the family together. Robin enjoyed her life on Gorton Lake, and all of its beauty, especially the sunsets and the birds. It also provided a safe haven for all her pets, whom she deeply loved. She had a love for frogs, and had a vast collection of many frog figurines. Most of all, she will always be in her familyʼs hearts as a devoted wife, mother, grandmother, great grandmother, sister, and a person that would always "be there" for anyone, family or not, in their time of need.<br>
Many mourn her passing; her husband, Paul H. Hadley; her daughters Terry VanDyke & her companion Mark Swartout of Boonville, Marjorie & her husband Jason Tanney of Brookfield; her sons Jean Spooner and James Spooner both of Brookfield, and Nelson & his wife Wendy Hadley of Waterville; her siblings Robert Wyman, Georgianna (Michael) Golden, Michael Wyman, Ronald Wyman, Jerry (Sara) Wyman, Jenny (Bob) Perry, Candy (Becky) Wyman, and Aaron (Jannis) Wyman; her beloved grandchildren Samantha (Joshua) Brown, Matthew VanDyke, Daniel (Ashley) Gray, Bradley Gray, Isaiha Spooner, Amber Spooner, Cody Spooner, Ethan Hadley, Kiley Hadley, Dalton Tanney, Nathan Tanney, Nicholas Tanney, Jessie Spooner, Jazmine Spooner; her beloved two great-granddaughters Sophia VanDyke and Adelynn Brown. Robin is also survived by her constant companion, her miniature poodle, Peachy Keen, and numerous nieces, nephews, and beloved close friends.<br>
Robin was predeceased by her parents George & Dawn; her father & mother-in-law Roland & Eleanor Stephenson; her brother Sean Bradley; her sister-in-law, Christine Wyman and a year ago her beloved son Malcolm J. "Macky" Spooner, Jr.<br>
Family and friends were invited to attend calling hours from 10 AM until 12 Noon at the Paul Funeral Home, Brookfield. A short informal service (shared memories by family and friends) will follow calling hours. Interment will be in North Brookfield Cemetery at the familyʼs convenience.<br>

Mary WYRALL
<p>
<a name ="I005932"><b>[I005932]</b></a><br />
The English origins of Mrs. Mary Brewster are not known.  A number of theories have been proposed over the years, including maiden names such as Wentworth, Love, Wyrall, and others.  However, no proof to support any of these theories has been found.<br>
<br>
We know that Mary was born about 1569, because she stated she was 40 years old in an affidavit filed in Leiden, Holland on 25 June 1609.  She was presumably from the vicinity of Doncaster, Yorkshire or Scrooby, Nottinghamshire, as she married William Brewster there about 1592 and had their first son Jonathan born there a year later.  She next had a daughter Patience, born about 1600 or somewhat earlier.  About 1606, the church congregation began more formally meeting at the Scrooby manor, where she and husband William resided.  About this time, pressure from the English authorities was mounting, and the meetings became more and more secretive.  She gave birth to another daughter at this time, which they named Fear.  The couple fled just over a year later for Holland with the other members of the congregation, and in Leiden they buried an unnamed child: presumably one that had died in infancy.  In 1611, she gave birth to a son they named Love, and two or three years later gave birth to their last son, which they named Wrestling.<br>
<br>
Mary came to Plymouth on the Mayflower in 1620 with husband William, and her two youngest children Love and Wrestling.  Mary was one of only five adult women to survive the first winter, and one of only four women to survive to the so-called "first" Thanksgiving in 1621.  Son Jonathan Brewster joined the family in November 1621, arriving at Plymouth on the ship Fortune.  Daughters Patience and Fear came on the ship Anne in 1623.  Mary died in 1627 at Plymouth, having reached about the age of 60.  Husband William survived her, and would live another 17 years before he died.[Caulkins.FTW]<br>

<p>
<a name ="I044420"><b>[I044420]</b></a><br />
Sheila Mary Pope, 80, died March 6, 2004 at a local hospital after a short illness. She was born January 3, 1924 into a pioneer family in Scottsbluff, Neb. Her parents were Mable and Frank Yarnall. At the age of 18, she was chosen to work for the Federal Bureau of Investigation in Washington, D.C. and moved to the nation's capital in 1942. Her career began in the fingerprint section and she worked in other departments for 10 years until 1951. She left the FBI to marry and start a family. She also was a clerk at Denver General Hospital in Denver, Colo. in the 1950s. When she moved to Orange County in Southern California in the 1960s, she was hired as the first clerk in the newly incorporated City of Westminster's police department. Because she was the only female in the department at the time, she performed an array of police matron duties as well as clerical work. She later worked in a medical office and as a construction secretary in Southern California. She retired to Hemet in 1991 and moved to Paradise in 1998. She loved crossword puzzles and classical music, and in her earlier years, aspired to be a classical pianist. She is survived by her daughter and son-in-law, Laurie and Thomas Kavenaugh of Chico; her grandson and grand-daughter-in-law, Scott and Robyn Clifton of Chino Valley, Ariz.; and four step-grandchildren. There will be a small tree planted in her honor today at her residence at Mountain Meadow Lodge. A private family memorial service will be held later.<br>
