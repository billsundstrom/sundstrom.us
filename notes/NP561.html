<p>
<a name ="I092769"><b>[I092769]</b></a><br />
ANN V. HOWARD - a long-time Greenwich resident died in her sleep September 22, 2005 at 95 in Saint Petersburg, FL. Born on May 22, 1910 in Stamford, Anna Agnes Velesbir was the first of four born to immigrant parents from Slovakia. Ann Howard was a Stamford High School graduate. She married James Howard of Stamford in 1933 and lived in Old Greenwich since 1941. She was a corsetier for more than 20 years and was affectionately known in the Cos Cob/Greenwich area as the "Girdle Lady". Later she worked in several banks and offices and was an active member of St. Catherine's of Sienna Parish.<br>
Jimmy, her husband referred to her as the "late Mrs. Howard" because of her perpetual tardiness. Ann's solution was to put all the clocks ahead by 10 minutes. This worked for a while until she started using the extra ten minutes.<br>
She was a remarkable woman who seemed to have a lead foot when driving. On one occasion after being stopped in New York State, she convinced the trooper that the car was not capable of such high speeds.<br>
On another occasion after giving her expired driver's license to the trooper she said, " Oh I don't think you will like this". The trooper asked, "What do you mean?" Ann said "Oh it's a bad picture of me". Eventually she received a letter from the governor's office stating that she was banned from driving in the state of New York.<br>
She was a world traveler in her retirement years and a summer resident of Middletown Springs, VT. She carried some of the traditions from her parents: spoke Slovak, tended a garden and cooked recipes from the old country. Ann was an excellent role model, a good person and loved by her family, friends and neighbors.<br>
She was predeceased by her husband James J. Howard, Jr., they were married 51 years, a son James J. (Jay) Howard III, a brother, John Velesbir and two sisters, Valda Wardwell and Margaret Coleman, all from Stamford.<br>
Ann is survived by two children, Beverly Burchard of Norwalk, CT and Paul Howard of McLean, VA, six grandchildren and 4 great grandchildren.<br>
Services were held at St. Catherine's at 10 am September 26, 2005 and burial was at Fairfield Memorial Park.<br>

The Perry Hall resident was 80.<br>
Mr. Vernarelli, one of 14 children of Italian immigrants, was born at home on East Chase Street.<br>
When he was 16, he tried to enlist in the Army, until military authorities learned his age and he was sent home from Fort Meade to Baltimore.<br>
"The next year, on March 27, 1947 - one day after his 17th birthday - he enlisted," said a nephew, Mark Vernarelli, who is a spokesman for the state Department of Public Safety and Correction Services.<br>
Mr. Vernarelli remained in the Army for the next 24 years, which included three tours of wartime duty in Korea and later Vietnam.<br>
As a military police officer, he spent the majority of his career traveling across the nation and overseeing the guarding of American munitions that were being shipped to overseas bases.<br>
His decorations included two Bronze Stars, the Legion of Merit, Korean and Vietnam service medals and the Army and NATO commendation medals.<br>
"My uncle was a fine, morally upright man who loved the Army and serving his country," his nephew said.<br>

While in the Army, Mr. Vernarelli earned his General Educational Development certificate and later attended Virginia Community College in Annandale, Va.<br>
After being discharged from the Army in 1971, Mr. Vernarelli and his wife settled in Northern Virginia, where he launched a second career as a chef.<br>
"He liked cooking, and his friend, Tom Weston, who owned Tom Weston's in Annandale, said he needed a chef for a while, so my husband took the job and stayed 10 years," Mrs. Vernarelli said.<br>
He also had cooked at Vinnie's in Fairfax, Va.<br>
"At home," Mrs. Vernarelli said, "he liked cooking seafood, and one of his specialties was Seafood Norfolk."<br>
The couple, who returned to Baltimore in 1987, later settled in Perry Hall.<br>

Verl Edward VETTE
<p>
<a name ="I101831"><b>[I101831]</b></a><br />
Verl Vette was a loving husband, father, grandfather, great-grandfather, brother and uncle. Verl is survived by his sons, Paul Vette Terri Vette, Nicole, Michelle, Ryan, and Brandt, Michael Vette Andra Vette, Kristopher, and Lara, and Kevin Vette Karen Bridges, Kyle, and Anne's daughters Kelley Bachman Karl Bachman, Colin, and Jeffrey and Amy Cordova Johnny Cordova, Jared. Verl is also survived by his brother Marvin Vette, and sisters Marolyn Kay Kinnie, Rebecca Bien, Thelma Lee Rogers, Wilda McLinden and Cheryl Fournier. Verl had 11 grandchildren, 3 great-grandchildren with 2 great-grandchildren on the way! Sadly hours before Verl passed, his oldest grandson, Jeremy, also passed in San Luis Obispo, California.<br>
Verl was the oldest of eight children, and grew up on a farm in Kansas. It was here that he acquired his hard work ethic and discovered his knack to fix things as he tinkered with farm equipment. After marrying his junior high sweet heart, Darlene, he started his first job as a mechanic. Soon after, their family began to grow with the arrival of the first of their 3 sons, Paul, followed by Michael and Kevin. As Verl worked on cars, his love for the automotive industry grew. When he was afforded the opportunity, he purchased a Chrysler franchise that he named Dodge City. Throughout his time with the Chrysler Corporation, he was able to travel the world with Darlene, where they acquired a deep love for food, art, music and culture, which they passed along to their children and grandchildren.<br>
Verl sold Dodge City in 1990, to enjoy an early retirement. A few years later, on April 23, 1996, he lost the first love of his life, Darlene, to cancer.<br>
After Darlene's passing, Verl immersed himself in his children's and grandchildren's lives. He hosted more retreats in Breckenridge, traveled the country for soccer tournaments, vacationed with his siblings, travelled Europe, and made every holiday a true celebration. Many of those survived by Verl agree that some of the warmest holiday moments were spent sitting around the dinner table, exchanging timeless stories of the past.<br>
Verl struck love once more, when he met the second love of his life, Anne. They married in 2000 and shared 13 beautiful years together. Verl and Anne's most favorite moments were spent with their children and grandchildren. They also loved to dance, to go to Anne's art shows, to travel, and to have afternoon "tea" time in their own home, enjoying their beautiful view. One of their favorite daily activities was to do the crossword puzzle in the paper. Anne would make a copy and work off the copy, and Verl worked his off the paper. It became a fun "race" each day to see who would get the puzzle done first for the day! As long as Verl and Anne were together, they were happy. They had 13 beautiful years together before Anne passed away on August 1, 2013 after a long fight with ovarian cancer. And one of the lasting results of their time together is a beautiful extended family who love each other and are honored to be part of the same family.<br>
Verl was always active philanthropically and with community events. Earlier In his life he was a member of the CADA Colorado Auto Dealers Association, and the NADA National Auto Dealers Association. He was also a patron of the Denver Art Museum.<br>
Verl passed away from pancreatic and liver cancer a few short months after Anne passed. He was grateful for the support and love he received while he was sick. He maintained a positive attitude throughout and his humor held strong until the end. Verl never failed to express his love to every family member and friend who was at his side. The family is so thankful for how Verl loved each one of us, giving us his very best. We love him more than words can say, and we are deeply saddened by his passing. Yet, we have hope knowing that he is no longer suffering and is with the Lord in heaven. The family counts their blessings for the dear memories we have with Verl. He will remain in our hearts forever and we know he is in a better place.<br>
