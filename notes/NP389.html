She participated in many quilting groups and especially enjoyed her involvement in the PHD quilting group that she helped found in Portland, Oregon, 32 years ago. Her quilting legacy is continued by her quilter friends, and members of her family. There was never a Keifer household in want of the warmth of Dorothyʼs quilts.<br>
