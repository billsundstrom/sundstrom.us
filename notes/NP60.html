From Christina Brundage:<br>
"She had a son, Frank Edwin Brundage, whose name legally was changed to Wood, I believe, but I don't know when.  He was born July 20, 1935 and died July 25 last year in Clearwater, FL.  I don't believe he had any children but I know nothing about his life.  I know he used about 15 aliases in his criminal career and that the bank managing the interest payments from a trust had a terrible time locating him.  Even in prison, he was there under different names!"<br>

Josephine H. BRUNDAGE
<p>
<a name ="I011839"><b>[I011839]</b></a><br />
She visited Charles S. Miller, when her brother - Frank - was a student at Syracuse University.  She revealed that she had been adopted by a wealthy family (Hammond).<br>
Her home was in Albany and she had a summer home in the White Mountains and a winter home in Florida.<br>
My research indicates the following:<br>
Charles Darius Hammond and Eunice Eleanor Babcock adopted Josephine before 1898.  They resided in Bethlehem, Albany, NY.  Charles was born 1 March 1844 at Rushford, NY, and died 4 November 1931 at St. Petersburg, FL. Eleanor was born in 24 NOV 1844 at Friendship, NY and died 12 November 1922 at Albany. They are burried at Graceland Cemetery in Albany. They were married 29 JAN 1866 at Friendship, NY. <br>
In 1930 Josephine was still unmarried and living in St. Petersburg with her adoptive father.<br>
----------------------------------------------------<br>
From Chistina Brundage:<br>
"Josephine ended her days in St. Petersburg, FL, but had little to do with her brother's family.  There was some bad feeling that she was very wealthy but did nothing to help her brother when he was poor.  I know in her old age, she had dementia but 2 men married her for her money but died before her.  I don't know the date of her death."<br>

ANNA ENQUIST<br>
It is with great sadness, we announce the passing of Anna Enquist (nee Brunel), on June 5, 2016, at the Saul & Claribel Simkin Centre. Anna is lovingly remembered by her children, Irene (Robert Memka), Marcel (Doris) Monney, Denise (Randy Waylett) and Carol (Mark Thiessen), 14 grandchildren and 19 great-grandchildren; her sister Colombe Chabbert; sisters-in-law, Mary Enquist and Evelyn Enquist, and numerous nephews and nieces. She was predeceased by her loving husband Ernest (2010); her son Edouard Monney (2013); her parents, Edouard and Alphonsine (Bourrier) Brunel; her brothers, Alphonse (Marthe), Leon (Marie), Roger (Flore), Gilbert (Germaine); and by her twin sister Melina (Julien) Thorimbert; and brother-in-law Louis Chabbert. Anna was born on December 31, 1922 and raised on the farm at St. Lupicin. In 1941, she married Camille Monney in St. Lupicin and moved to Winnipeg, where she worked at Pelland's Catering and the Marion Hotel in the 1950s. She married Ernie Enquist in 1965 and together they operated the Ile des Chenes Hotel in the late 1960s, where 14 hour work days were common. In 1980, they built their cottage at Bird River, where many years of enjoyment were had with relatives and friends playing cards, boat rides, water skiing and fishing. They enjoyed many trips to the U.S. with their 23 foot trailer and parking in a shopping centre was a common occurrence. The whole family has great memories of gatherings at Anna and Ernie's for what was a Christmas Eve tradition, plenty of food and gift exchanges with all the grandkids, ending way into the night. Anna was skilled at many hobbies including gardening, sewing, crocheting and knitting. She made beautiful afghans for each of her children and grandchildren to treasure. We would like to thank the Saul & Claribel Simkin Centre and prior to that, the Golden Links Lodge for the wonderful love and care the staff showed to Anna. She was surrounded by her children in her final hours sharing fond memories that will not be forgotten. Granny, as she is known to her grandchildren and great-grandchildren, has left an indelible stamp on each of their lives. In lieu of flowers, memorial donations may be made to the Canadian Cancer Society or the Alzheimer Society.

William B. BRUNER
<p>
<a name ="I061847"><b>[I061847]</b></a><br />
William could not read or write, so no written record is available. The information recorded for the Bruner's was set down by Fred Leroy Bruner from information from Martha Bruner and Hiram Parkman.<br>
The Bruner stock came originally from Germany and settled in Virginia sometime before 1850. Great Grandpa Bruner's family spoke only German. The next generation moved West into Kentucky. They spoke both English and German in the home.<br>
William and family homesteaded on 160 acres at Palo Verde, Arizona. Those were rugged times. Most of the country was brush infested with rattlesnakes, coyotes and other forms of wild life. The Buckeye canal was a young project and had to be patched up after every rain. The brush dam gave a lot of trouble. Water ran the year round in the Gila and floods made the dam expensive to maintain. It was up to the farmers to do much of the repair work. So the women spent much of their time holding down the home and keeping things going. Mother planted an orchard and vineyard, and practically all the fruit we ate came from it. There were apricots, pears, peached, figs, almonds, plumbs, quinces and crabapples, and of course mulberries. There were not as many insect pests to contend with, and I never knew of a poison spray of any kind being used. In the vineyard were muskets, tokays, mission, thompson seedless, and a wine grape. From the orchard, and the vineyard and a garden came the major portion of the living.<br>
