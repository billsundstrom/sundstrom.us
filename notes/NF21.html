Paul J. and Nellie M. Creel celebrated their 70th wedding anniversary Nov. 1 with an open house at the Talent Community Hall.<br>
Hosts of the event, with approximately 125 friends, family members and neighbors attending, were their children, Colleen Ferns of Prospect, Paulette Hendrickson of Medford and Dennis Creel of Salem.<br>
Paul J. Creel married Nellie M. Rowe on Nov. 1, 1938, in Dufur. They had a short service in a little church with only their families in attendance.<br>
Paul and Nellie's first home was a ranch in Dufur, where Paul plowed the fields with a team of eight horses and Nellie fed a crew of a dozen ranch hands. Their first daughter, Colleen, was born there. When the war broke out, they moved to Seattle to lend their efforts to World War II. While Paul was working at Sand Point Naval Air Station, Nellie gave birth to their second daughter, Paulette. They missed their family in Oregon, so they moved to Eastern Oregon. The winters were so cold that they decided to try the warmer, milder climate of Southern Oregon.<br>
In 1949, with two little girls, Paul and Nellie moved to the little house on what is now Creel Road, just outside of Talent, and decided that the pears, apples and sunshine of the Rogue Valley would be a perfect fit for their family. A few years later, their only son, Dennis, was born.<br>
Paul and Nellie have been active in 4-H Clubs, Girl Scout and Boy Scout Clubs and church youth programs supporting their children. With high school came Band Boosters, and Pep Club programs as well as basketball games and school meetings. Paul has been very active in the Talent Community Town Hall meetings voicing his opinions on several projects important to the people of the community.<br>
He worked at Boise Cascade's sawmill for many years and retired from that company in the 1970s.<br>
Nellie was a stay-at-home mom, ready with a hot breakfast and cookies after school. They have both been active in the Christian Church in Ashland, and have attended the Talent Bible Church.<br>
In addition to their children, the Creels have eight grandchildren and 13 great-grandchildren.<br>
