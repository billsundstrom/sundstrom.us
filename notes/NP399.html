Waltheof II of NORTHUMBERLAND
<p>
<a name ="I005099"><b>[I005099]</b></a><br />
From Wikipedia<br>
<br>
Waltheof, 1st Earl of Northampton (d. 1076) was the last of the Anglo-Saxon earls, remaining in England for a decade after the Norman conquest.<br>
<br>
He was a son of Earl Siward of Northumbria, and, although he was probably educated for a monastic life, became Earl of Huntingdon and Earl of Northumberland about 1065. After the Battle of Hastings he submitted to William the Conqueror; but when Sweyn II of Denmark invaded Northern England in 1069 he joined him with Edgar Ætheling and took part in the attack on York, only, however, to make a fresh submission after their departure in 1070. Then, restored to his earldom, he married William's niece, Judith, and in 1072 was appointed Earl of Northampton.<br>
<br>
The Domesday Book (ordered to be prepared by William the Conqueror, and finally completed in 1086) mentioned Waltheof ("Walleff"); "'In Hallam ("Halun"), one manor with its sixteen hamlets, there are twenty-nine carucates [~14 km2] to be taxed. There Earl Waltheof had an "Aula" [hall or court]. There may have been about twenty ploughs. This land Roger de Busli holds of the Countess Judith." (Hallam, or Hallamshire, is now part of the city of Sheffield, in the county of South Yorkshire).<br>
<br>
In 1075 Waltheof joined the conspiracy against the king arranged by the earls of Norfolk and Hereford; but soon repenting of his action he confessed his guilt to Archbishop Lanfranc, and then to William, who was in Normandy. Returning to England with William he was arrested, and after being brought twice before the king's court was sentenced to death. On the 31st of May 1076 he was beheaded on St Giles's Hill, near Winchester. Weak and unreliable in character, Waltheof, like his father, is said to have been a man of immense bodily strength. Devout and charitable, he was regarded by the English as a martyr, and miracles were said to have been worked at his tomb at Crowland. The earl left three daughters, the eldest of whom, Matilda, brought the earldom of Huntingdon to her second husband, David I of Scotland. One of Waltheof's grandsons was Waltheof (d. 1159), abbot of Melrose. His creation of the earldom of Northampton, however, died with him, and he would remain the last to hold a Saxon-era title until the Earl of Wessex nearly a thousand years later.<br>

Harald I Halfdansson of NORWAY
<p>
<a name ="I008097"><b>[I008097]</b></a><br />
King of Vestfold, King of Norway, had many wives and concubines, undertook conquest of Norway to win Gytha, and until successful refused for ten years to cut or comb hair (called Lufa, "the Slovenly"), became 1st King of all Norway abt. 883/890, cut hair after conquest (then called "Fairhair"), won Gytha, d. abt. 936.<br>
<br>
MISC: Harald inherited three small domains from his father in eastern, central, and western Norway, and set out to conquer the rest of Norway. According to the medieval saga, he was motivated by the refusal of Gyda (another petty king's daughter) to marry him until he had conquered all of Norway. According to the story, King Harald declared that he would not cut or comb his hair until he had conquered all of Norway. When he finally had victory about ten years later, he then had his hair done and was called "Fairhair." The chieftains of western Norway were the hardest to defeat, but Harald attained his victory in the Battle of Hafrsfjord about 885. Harald was a strong ruler, and managed to unite Norway. At Harald's death, his sons divided Norway with the favorite son, Eric Bloodaxe, as the overking, but dissensions and wars disrupted the unity of the country.<br>
<br>
Alternatively, there are references that spell his first name "Harold," and list his death date as being 933 or 945.<br>
<br>
He succeeded to the throne of his father's kingdom as a child in 860.<br>
<br>
Age at death: Over 72.<br>
<br>
He was the first king of United Norway.<br>
<br>
[Sharen Neal, MJR6387, worldconnect.rootsweb.com]<br>
<br>
-------------------------------------------------------------------------- ------------<br>
following is from Randy Jones, World Connect db=randyj2222, rootsweb.com:<br>
-------------------------------------------------------------------------- ------------<br>
<br>
The history of Norway prior to the late tenth century is extremely obscure, and the lineage of Harald is uncertain prior to his father. The old poem Ynglingatal is quoted (incompletely, with some missing stanzas of unknown content) in Heimskringla (early thirteenth century), and appears to have been composed in the late ninth or early tenth century, although that is not certain. Even if we grant for the moment that Heimskringla quotes an accurate version of an early poem, we still have the fact that Ynglingatal only gives the names of the kings, and does not supply any of the genealogical relationships which appear in so many later sources. It is not until sources of the twelfth century that there is any clear indication that the king mentioned in each stanza was regarded as the son of the king mentioned in the previous stanza, and this could easily be a very late invention. That the kings listed in the last few stanzas existed may be regarded as likely, but they remain very shadowy figures whose exact historical and genealogical connections are nebulous. At various times in the past, attempts have been made to identify one or more of them with individuals known from contemporary historical sources, but there are no identifications of the kings in Ynglingatal with known historical figures which can be regarded as certain. -- Stewart Baldwin<br>
<br>
<br>
The source for this is a fragment of Ynglingatal repeated in Snorri's Heimskringla. Snorri wrote his work about 400 years after the events it is describing. It tells of Olaf Tree-Cutter founding Norway, and passing it to his son Halfdan Whiteleg. Halfdan had sons Eystein and Gudrod. Eystein had a son Halfdan. He was followed by Gudrod, son of Halfdan, and he was father of Olaf, father of Ragnevald, for whom the original poem was composed. The classical reconstruction is that this is a straight shot (Olaf- Halfdan- Eystein- Halfdan- Gudrod- Olaf- Ragnevald). However, it has been suggested that Gudrod, son of Halfdan Whiteleg sticks out like a sore thumb. He neither succeeded, nor is there any reason for him being mentioned at all (no other "other sons" are mentioned). Maybe, the speculation runs, he is the Gudrod Halfdanson who later became king - that Halfdan Eysteinson was followed not by his son, but by his uncle. One could argue this in circles, but it doesn't matter.An analysis of the succession after Rognevald reveals a splice between two traditions. Halfdan the Black is made son of Gudrod born of a second marriage, and left an infant coheir with his "brother" Olaf. The location of his rule is nowhere near the location where his predicessors are said to have ruled, and later his son Harald is made to defeat all of the other kinglets of Norway, including kings of places that Halfdan was supposed to have ruled. Finally, what appears to be a near-contemporary poem celebrating Halfdan the Black seems not to know his father. To make a long story short (too late! you say), it looks like the new dynasty, descended from Halfdan the Black, were attached after the fact to the family celebrated in the Ynglingatal (who actually appear to have been enemies that they displaced). Nothing before Halfdan the Black can be trusted, and it is not clear that the lines back to Harald Fairhair should be trusted either. The whole "kidnappped as an infant and didn't come back until an adult at the head of a strong army" thing about Olaf Trygvison smells foul. St. Olaf owed his position to being Olaf I's right-hand man, while Harald Hardrade was his step-brother. I have my serious doubts about the Fairhair pedigrees attached to each of them. -- Todd Farmerie<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
From Wikipedia<br>
<br>
Harald Fairhair (Old Norse:Haraldr hinn hárfagri, Icelandic:Haraldur hinn hárfagri, Norwegian:Harald Hårfagre) (c. 850 - c. 933) was the founder and first king (872 - 930) over Norway.<br>
<br>
He succeeded on the death of his father Halfdan the Black Gudrødsson in A.D. 860 to the sovereignty of several small and somewhat scattered kingdoms, which had come into his father's hands through conquest and inheritance and lay chiefly in south-east Norway.<br>
<br>
The constitution of Norway is, according to a tale, somewhat of a love story. The tale begins with a marriage proposal that resulted in rejection and scorn from Gyda, the daughter of a neighbouring king. She said she refused to marry him before he was king over all of Norway. Harald was therefore induced to take a vow not to cut nor comb his hair until he was sole king of Norway, and that ten years later he was justified in trimming it; whereupon he exchanged the epithet "Shockhead" for the one by which he is usually known. Whether this is actually true is debatable; the name "fairhair" may simply mean that Harald had blonde hair.<br>
<br>
In 866 he made the first of a series of conquests over the many petty kingdoms which then composed Norway, including those which had sworn allegiance to the Swedish king Erik Eymundsson. In 872, after a great victory at Hafrsfjord near Stavanger, he found himself king over the whole country. His realm was, however, threatened by dangers from without, as large numbers of his opponents had taken refuge, not only in Iceland, then recently discovered, but also in the Orkney Islands, Shetland Islands, Hebrides Islands and Faroe Islands, and in Scotland itself; and from these winter quarters sallied forth to harry Norway as well as the rest of northern Europe. Their numbers were increased by malcontents from Norway, who resented Harald's claim of rights of taxation over lands, which the possessors appear to have previously held in absolute ownership. At last Harald was forced to make an expedition to the west to clear the islands and Scottish mainland of Vikings. A great number of them fled to Iceland, which grew into an independent commonwealth, while the Scottish isles fell under Norwegian rule.<br>
<br>
The latter part of Harald's reign was disturbed by the strife of his many sons. He gave them all the royal title and assigned lands to them which they were to govern as his representatives; but this arrangement did not put an end to the discord, which continued into the next reign. When he grew old he handed over the supreme power to his favourite son Eirik Bloodaxe, whom he intended to be his successor. Harald died in 933, having had eight wives and 23 children. Twelve of his sons became kings, two of them over the whole country.<br>
