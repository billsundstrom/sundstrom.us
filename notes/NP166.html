<h2>Notes</h2>
Stephen of ENGLAND
<p>
<a name ="I008047"><b>[I008047]</b></a><br />
Stephen (1096 - October 25, 1154), the last Norman King of England, reigned from 1135 to 1154, when he was succeeded by his cousin Henry II, the first of the Angevin or Plantagenet Kings.<br>
<br>
Stephen was born at Blois in France, the son of Stephen, Count of Blois, and Adela (daughter of William the Conqueror). His brother was Henry of Blois, bishop of Winchester. Stephen became Count of Mortain in about 1115, and married Matilda, daughter of the Count of Boulogne, in about 1125, who shortly after became Countess of Boulogne. Stephen became joint ruler in 1128. In 1150 he ceased to co-rule, and in 1151, the County was given to his son, Eustace IV. When Eustace died childless, Stephen's next living son, William inherited the territory.<br>
<br>
Before the death of King Henry I of England in 1135, the majority of the barons of England swore to support Henry's daughter (also named Matilda and granddaughter of William the Conqueror), and her claim to the throne. However, Stephen (also a grandchild of The Conqueror through his mother and who had been raised at Henry's court) laid claim to the throne. He also claimed his uncle, King Henry, had changed his mind on his deathbed, and named Stephen as his heir. Once Stephen was crowned, he gained the support of the majority of the barons as well as Pope Innocent II. The first few years of his reign were peaceful, but by 1139 he was seen as weak and indecisive, setting the country up for a civil war, commonly called The Anarchy.<br>
<br>
Stephen had many traits that made him seem superficially fit for kingship: his high birth, his descent from the Conqueror, his handsomeness, his bravery and good nature. But he possessed none of the ruthlessness necessary for the ruthless times he lived in; indeed, Walter Map says of Stephen: "He was adept at the martial arts but in other respects little more than a simpleton."<br>
<br>
Bad omens haunted him before the Battle of Lincoln (2 February 1141). Stephen was facing his rebellious barons Robert, 1st Earl of Gloucester (the Empress' illegitimate half-brother) and the Earl of Chester. He fought so bravely in the battle that his battle-axe shattered. He drew a sword and continued fighting until it broke as well, as he was captured by a knight named William de Cahagnes. Stephen was defeated and he was brought before his cousin, the Empress Matilda.<br>
<br>
Stephen was imprisoned at Bristol, but his wife, the Countess Matilda, kept faith, and the Empress was soon forced out of London. With the capture of her most able lieutenant, the Earl of Gloucester, Matilda was eventually obliged to release Stephen from captivity, and he was restored to the throne in November of the same year. In December 1142, the Empress was besieged at Oxford, but she managed to escape.<br>
<br>
In 1147, Empress Matilda's adolescent son, Henry (the eventual King Henry II), decided to assist in the war effort by raising a small army of mercenaries and invading England. Rumors of this army's size terrified Stephen's retainers, although in truth the force was very small. Having been defeated twice in battle, and with no money to pay his mercenaries, the young Henry appealed to his uncle Robert for aid but was turned away. Desperately, and in secret, the boy then asked Stephen for help. According to the Gesta Stephani, "On receiving the message, the king, who was ever full of pity and compassion, hearkened to the young man..." and bestowed upon him money and other support. Despite this generosity, there is no evidence for the rumors that Stephen was Henry's biological father.<br>
<br>
Stephen maintained his precarious hold on the throne for the remainder of his lifetime. However, following the death of his son and heir, Eustace, in 1153, he was persuaded to reach a compromise with Empress Matilda whereby her son would succeed Stephen on the English throne as King Henry II.<br>
<br>
Stephen died at Dover, and was buried in Faversham Abbey, which he had founded with Countess Matilda in 1147<br>
<br>
Besides Eustace, Stephen and Matilda had two other sons, Baldwin (d. before 1135), and William of Blois (Count of Mortain and Boulogne, and Earl of Surrey or Warenne). They also had two daughters, Matilda and Marie of Boulogne. In addition to these children, Stephen fathered at least three illegitimate children, one of whom, Gervase, became Abbot of Westminster.<br>
<br>
The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle (the Peterborough Chronicle, second continuation) provides a moving and succinct appraisal of Stephen's reign:<br>
<br>
    "In the days of this King there was nothing but strife, evil, and robbery, for quickly the great men who were traitors rose against him. When the traitors saw that Stephen was a good-humoured, kindly, and easy-going man who inflicted no punishment, then they committed all manner of horrible crimes . . . And so it lasted for nineteen years while Stephen was King, till the land was all undone and darkened with such deeds, and men said openly that Christ and his angels slept".<br>
</p>
William II of ENGLAND
<p>
<a name ="I005340"><b>[I005340]</b></a><br />
From Wikipedia<br>
<br>
William II (called "Rufus", perhaps because of his red-faced appearance) (c. 1056-August 2, 1100) was the second son of William the Conqueror and was King of England from 1087 until 1100, with powers also over Normandy, and influence in Scotland. He was less successful in extending his control in Wales.<br>
<br>
Although William was an effective soldier, he was a ruthless ruler and was little liked by those he governed; according to the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, he was "hated by almost all his people." However, it is not surprising that the chroniclers of his time took a dim view of Rufus, because many literate men of the day were men of the Church, against which Rufus fought hard and long, and in Norman tradition William Rufus scorned the Anglo-Saxons and their culture. (Cantor 1993, p 280)<br>
<br>
William himself seems to have been a flamboyant character, and his reign was marked by his bellicose temperament. He never married or had illegitimate children; William's favourite was Ranulf Flambard, whom he appointed Bishop of Durham in 1099, an appointment based on political requirements, for a see that was at the same time a great feudal fief. It has been suggested that William was homosexual.<br>
Early years<br>
<br>
William's exact date of birth is unknown, but it was some time between the years 1056 and 1060. He was born in his father's duchy of Normandy, which would be inherited in due course by his elder brother, Robert Curthose, a third son during his youth, educated under the eye of Lanfranc and destined to be a great lord but not a king, until the death of the Conqueror's second son put him in the line of succession. His father's favourite son, William succeeded to the throne of England on his father's death, but there was always hostility between him and his eldest brother, though they became reconciled after an attempted coup in 1091 by their youngest brother, Henry.<br>
<br>
Relations between the three brothers had never been excellent; Orderic Vitalis relates an incident that took place at Laigle, in 1077 or 1078. William and Henry, having grown bored with casting dice, decided to make mischief by pouring fetid water on their brother Robert from an upper gallery, thusly infuriating and shaming him. A brawl broke out, and their father King William was forced to intercede and restore order.<br>
<br>
Appearance<br>
According to William of Malmesbury, William Rufus was "thickset and muscular with a protruding belly; a dandy dressed in the height of fashion, however outrageous, he wore his blond hair long, parted in the centre and off the face so that his forehead was bare; and in his red, choleric face were eyes of changeable colour, speckled with flecks of light" (Barlow).<br>
<br>
England and France<br>
The division of William the Conqueror's lands into two parts presented a dilemma for those nobles who held land on both sides of the Channel. Since the younger William and Robert were natural rivals, these nobles worried that they could not hope to please both of their lords, and thus ran the risk of losing the favor of one ruler or the other (or both of them). The only solution, as they saw it, was to unite England and Normandy once more under one ruler. The pursuit of this aim led them to revolt against William in favor of Robert in the Rebellion of 1088, under the leadership of the powerful Bishop Odo of Bayeux, who was a half-brother of William the Conqueror. Robert failed to appear in England to rally huis supporters, and William won the support of the English with silver and promises of better government, and defeated the rebellion, thus securing his authority. In 1090 he invaded Normandy, crushing Robert's forces and forcing him to cede a portion of his lands. The two made up their differences and William agreed to help Robert recover lands lost to France, notably Maine.<br>
<br>
Thus William Rufus was secure in the most powerful kingdom in Europe (with the contemporary eclipse of the Salian Emperors) and, within England, the least tramelled by feudal obligations. As in Normandy, his bishops and abbots were bound to him by feudal obligations, and his right of investitute in the Norman tradition was unquestioned within the kingdom during the age of the Investiture Controversy that brought excommunication upon the Salian Emperor Henry IV. Anglo-Norman royal institutions reached an efficiency unknown in medieval Europe, and the king's personal power through an effective and loyal chancery penetrated to the local level to an extent unmatched in France. Without the Capetians' ideological trappings of an anointed monarchy forever entngled with the hierarchy of the Church, the King's administration and the King's law unified the kingdom, rendering trhe English King relatively impervious to papal codemnation, as the reign of William Rufus demonstrated.<br>
<br>
Power struggles<br>
William Rufus inherited the Anglo-Norman settlement whose details are reflected in Domesday Book (1086), a survey that could not have been undertaken anywhere in Europe at that time and a signal of the control of the monarchy, but he did not inherit William's charisma and political skills. Within a few years he lost William's advisor and confidant, the Italian-Norman archbishop of Canterbury, Lanfranc, in 1089.<br>
<br>
Much of William's reign was spent feuding with the church; after the death of Lanfranc, he delayed appointing a new archbishop while he appropriated ecclesiastical revenues in the interim, which was protracted, and for this he was much criticised. Finally, in a time of panic during William's serious illness in 1093 another Norman-Italian was made Archbishop of Canterbury, Anselm of Bec the greatest theologian of his generation, and this led to a long period of animosity between church and state. Anselm was a stronger supporter of the Gregorian reforms in the Church than Lanfranc had been. William and Anselm disagreed on a range of ecclesiastical issues, and the English clergy, beholden to the king for their preferments and livings were unable to support Anselm publicly. William called a council at Rockingham in 1095 to bring Anselm to heel but the churcvhman appealed to Rome. In October 1097, Anselm went into exile, taking his case to the Pope. The new pope was the diplomatic and flexible Cluniac Urban II who was not in a position to make further royal enemies. The Emperor of Germany supported an antipope, and Urban came to a concordat with William Rufus: William recognized Urban as pope and Urban gave sanction to the Anglo-Norma ecclesiastical status quo. William was able to claim the revenues of the archbishopric of Canterbury as long as Anselm remained in exile, and Anselm remained in exile until the reign of William's successor, Henry I.<br>
<br>
William Rufus was less capable than his father at channeling the Norman lords' propensity for indiscipline and violence. In 1095, Robert de Mowbray, the earl of Northumbria, would not come to William's Curia Regis the thrice-annual court where decisions were made and delivered to the great lords, and William subsequently led an army against him and defeated him; the earl was dispossessed and imprisoned. Another noble, William of Eu, was also accused of treachery and blinded and castrated. That same year, William II also made an unsuccessful foray into Wales. He tried again in 1097 with an equal lack of success. He returned to Normandy in 1097 and from then until 1099 campaigned in France, securing and holding northern Maine but failing to seize the French-controlled part of the Vexin region. At the time of his death he was planning to occupy Aquitaine in south-western France.<br>
<br>
William also quarrelled with the Scottish king, Malcolm III, forcing him to pay homage in 1091 and seizing the border city of Carlisle and Cumbria in 1092. At the Battle of Alnwick, November 13, 1093 Malcolm and his son were slain; William gained effective control of the Scottish throne after Malcolm's death, when he backed a successful bid by Edgar Atheling to dethrone Malcolm III's brother Donald Bane in favor of his nephew, also named Edgar. The newly crowned King Edgar, who ruled Scotland from 1097 to 1107, thus owed his position to William.<br>
<br>
In 1096, William's brother Robert Curthose joined the First Crusade. He needed money to fund this venture and pledged his duchy to William in return for a payment of 10,000 marks; a sum equalling about one-fourth of William's annual revenue. In a display of the effectiveness of Norman taxation inaugurated by the Conqueror, William raised the money by levying a special, heavy, and much-resented tax upon the whole of England. William then ruled Normandy as regent in Robert's absence-Robert did not return until September 1100, one month after William's death.<br>
<br>
The Court of William II<br>
William Rufus had a notorious disregard for the church; his most passionate detractors are found among clergymen. Eadmer relates two incidents in which William Rufus either convinced converted Jews to return to Judaism, or attempted to do so. During his quarrels with Anselm of Canterbury, the king declared that "he hated him much yesterday, that he hated him much today, and that he would hate him more and more tomorrow and every other day."<br>
<br>
William of Malmesbury decries William Rufus' court, which he describes as being filled by "effeminate" young men in extravagent clothes mincing about in "shoes with curved points". Orderic Vitalis makes mention of the "fornicators and sodomites" who held favor during William Rufus' reign, and remarks approvingly that when Henry became king, one of his first acts was to have his courtiers shorn of their long hair.<br>
<br>
<br>
The unusual death of William II<br>
Perhaps the most memorable event in the life of William Rufus was his death, which occurred while William was hunting in the New Forest. He was killed by an arrow through the heart, but the circumstances remain unclear.<br>
<br>
On a bright August day in 1100, William organised a hunting trip in the New Forest. An account by Orderic Vitalis described the preparations for the hunt:<br>
<br>
    ...an armourer came in and presented to him (Rufus) six arrows. The King immediately took them with great satisfaction, praising the work, and unconscious of what was to happen, kept four of them himself and held out the other two to Walter Tyrrel... saying It is only right that the sharpest be given to the man who knows how to shoot the deadliest shots.<br>
<br>
On the subsequent hunt, the party spread out as they chased their prey, and William, in the company of Walter Tirel (or Tyrell), Lord of Poix, became separated from the others. It was the last time that William was seen alive.<br>
<br>
William was found the next day by a group of local peasants lying dead in the woods with an arrow piercing his lungs. William's body was abandoned by the nobles at the place where he fell, because the law and order of the kingdom died with the king, and they had to flee to their English or Norman estates to secure their interests. Legend has it that it was left to a local charcoal-burner named Purkis to take the king's body to Winchester Cathedral on his cart.<br>
<br>
According to the chroniclers, William's death was not murder. Walter and William had been hunting together when Walter let loose a wild shot that, instead of hitting the stag he aimed for, struck William in the chest. Walter tried to help him, but there was nothing he could do. Fearing that he would be charged with murder, Walter panicked, leapt onto his horse, and fled. A version of this tale is given by William of Malmesbury in his Chronicle of the Kings of the English (c. 1128):<br>
<br>
    The day before the king died he dreamt that he went to heaven. He suddenly awoke. He commanded a light to be brought, and forbade his attendants to leave him. The next day he went into the forest... He was attended by a few persons... Walter Tirel remained with him, while the others, were on the chase. The sun was now declining, when the king, drawing his bow and letting fly an arrow, slightly wounded a stag which passed before him... The stag was still running... The king, followed it a long time with his eyes, holding up his hand to keep off the power of the sun's rays. At this instant Walter decided to kill another stag. Oh, gracious God! the arrow pierced the king's breast.<br>
<br>
    On receiving the wound the king uttered not a word; but breaking off the shaft of the arrow where it projected from his body... This accelerated his death. Walter immediately ran up, but as he found him senseless, he leapt upon his horse, and escaped with the utmost speed. Indeed there were none to pursue him: some helped his flight; others felt sorry for him.<br>
<br>
    The king's body was placed on a cart and conveyed to the cathedral at Winchester... blood dripped from the body all the way. Here he was buried within the tower. The next year, the tower fell down. William Rufus died in 1100... aged forty years. He was a man much pitied by the clergy... he had a soul which they could not save... He was loved by his soldiers but hated by the people because he caused them to be plundered.<br>
<br>
To some chroniclers, such an 'Act of God' was a just end for a wicked king. However, over the centuries, the obvious suggestion that one of William's many enemies may have had a hand in this extraordinary event has been repeatedly made. Even chroniclers of the time point out that Walter was renowned as a keen bowman, and unlikely to fire such an impetuous shot. And William's brother Henry, who was among the hunting party that day, benefitted directly from William's death, as he was shortly after crowned king.<br>
<br>
Abbot Suger, another chronicler, was Tirel's friend and sheltered him in his French exile. He said later:<br>
<br>
    It was laid to the charge of a certain noble, Walter Tirel, that he had shot the king with an arrow; but I have often heard him, when he had nothing to fear nor to hope, solemnly swear that on the day in question he was not in the part of the forest where the king was hunting, nor ever saw him in the forest at all.<br>

Ernest Oscar Ture ENQUIST
<p>
<a name ="I122155"><b>[I122155]</b></a><br />
ERNEST OSCAR TURE ENQUIST 1929 - 2010 It is with great sorrow and relief that the family announces the passing of Ernie, on Tuesday, June 22, 2010, after a lengthy battle with dementia that ended at Golden Links Lodge. Ernie is gone from our sight to be with loved ones who will have their arms open for his arrival. His final moments on this earth were thankfully brief and those he cared about rushed to be at his side. His memory will forever be cherished by his dear wife, Anna, his children: daughters, Denise (Randy), Carol (Mark) and Ed (Alice), Irene (Bob) and Marcel (Doris). He enjoyed every minute he spent with his 14 grandchildren and 17 great-grandchildren. He is survived by sister, Henny Hagborg; brother Clifford (Evelyn) and sister-in-law Mary. He was born to Swedish immigrants, Albin and Hilma Enquist on October 13, 1929 and grew up learning to farm near Chatfield, MB. He was predeceased by both his parents, his brothers, Enar, Harry and Eric and sisters, Astrid Gustafson and Ida Crozier. Ernie was a kind-hearted soul, the kind you read about. His rewards in life were reaped from the joy he got by giving to others. Never too busy to lend a hand and those hands could fix practically anything. You didn't need owner's manuals with Ernie around. In his spare time, he enjoyed picking berries (and could smell out the best patches), fishing, boating, playing cards (particularly Canasta), gardening and dancing into the wee hours. He even kept pace at the waterslides at age 67 and waterskiied at 68! He felt blessed and always looked at his cup as being more than half full. The jobs he really enjoyed were those where he served others. He had many positive sayings and lines that he would use to bolster one's spirit at any time. You just couldn't be unhappy for long if you were around Ernie. He always looked at the good side of things and could regularly be heard saying, It just doesn't get any better than this! In the end, he couldn't beat or fix this disease that took hold of his mind. God must have a special purpose for Ernie, to take this caring man to be with Him. In his short stay at Golden Links, he touched many hearts of the caregivers and we truly thank them for the tremendous care they returned. In lieu of flowers, please make a donation to the Alzheimer Society, 10-120 Donald Street, Winnipeg, MB R3C 9Z9, in the hopes that someday people afflicted with forms of dementia, don't have to suffer in silence. Viewing will be at 10:30 a.m., with Funeral Mass in celebration of Ernie's life at 11:00 a.m. on Saturday, June 26, 2010 at Holy Cross Parish, 252 Dubuc Street and interment will follow at the St. Boniface Cemetery. <br>
