Bohemund I of ANTIOCH
<p>
<a name ="I015196"><b>[I015196]</b></a><br />
From Wikipedia<br>
<br>
Bohemund I of Antioch (c. 1058 - March 3, 1111), prince of Taranto and afterwards prince of Antioch, was one of the leaders of the First Crusade.<br>
<br>
Bohemund was the eldest son of Robert Guiscard, Duke of Apulia and Calabria, by his first marriage (which was later annulled) to Alberada of Buonalbergo. He was christened "Mark" but came to be known as Bohemund, after a legendary giant of that name.<br>
<br>
He served under his father in the great attack on the Byzantine Empire (1080-1085), and commanded the Normans during Guiscard's absence (1082-1084), penetrating into Thessaly as far as Larissa, but being repulsed by Alexius I Comnenus. This early hostility to Alexius had a great influence in determining the course and policy of his reign from time of Bohemund (whom his father had destined for the throne of Constantinople) to King Roger.<br>
<br>
When Robert Guiscard died in 1085, Bohemund inherited his father's Adriatic possessions, which were soon lost to the Greeks, while his younger half-brother Roger Borsa inherited Apulia and the Italian possessions. The war was finally resolved by the mediation of Pope Urban II and the award of Taranto and other possessions to Bohemund. Though Bohemund received a small principality (an allodial possession) for himself in the heel of southern Italy, as compensation from Sikelgaita after renouncing his rights to the Duchy, he sought a greater status for himself. The chronicler Romoald of Salerno said of Bohemund that "he was always seeking the impossible."<br>
<br>
In 1096 Bohemund, along with his uncle Roger I of Sicily the great count of Sicily, was attacking Amalfi, which had revolted against Duke Roger, when bands of crusaders began to pass, on their way through Italy to Constantinople. The zeal of the crusader came upon Bohemund: it is possible, too, that he saw in the First Crusade a chance of realizing his father's policy of a Drang nach Osten, and hoped from the first to carve for himself an eastern principality. Geoffrey Malaterra bluntly states that Bohemund took the Cross with the intention of plundering and conquering Greek lands.<br>
<br>
He gathered a fine Norman army (perhaps the finest division in the crusading host), at the head of which he crossed the Adriatic Sea, and penetrated to Constantinople along the route he had tried to follow in 1082-1084. He was careful to observe a "correct" attitude towards Alexius, and when he arrived at Constantinople in April 1097 he did homage to the emperor. He may have negotiated with Alexius about a principality at Antioch; if he did so, he had little encouragement. From Constantinople to Antioch Bohemund was the real leader of the First Crusade; and it says much for his leadership that the First Crusade succeeded in crossing Asia Minor, which the Crusade of 1101, the Second Crusade in 1147, and the Third Crusade in 1189 failed to accomplish.<br>
<br>
The Emperor's daughter, Anna Comnena, leaves a good portrait of him in her The Alexiad; she met him for the first time when she was fourteen, and was quite fascinated by him. She left no similar portrait of any other Crusader prince. Of Bohemund, she wrote:<br>
<br>
    "Now [Bohemund] was such as, to put it briefly, had never before been seen in the land of the Romans, be he either of the barbarians or of the Greeks (for he was a marvel for the eyes to behold, and his reputation was terrifying). Let me describe the barbarian's appearance more particularly -- he was so tall in stature that he overtopped the tallest by nearly one cubit, narrow in the waist and loins, with broad shoulders and a deep chest and powerful arms. And in the whole build of the body he was neither too slender nor overweighted with flesh, but perfectly proportioned and, one might say, built in conformity with the canon of Polycleitus... His skin all over his body was very white, and in his face the white was tempered with red. His hair was yellowish, but did not hang down to his waist like that of the other barbarians; for the man was not inordinately vain of his hair, but had it cut short to the ears. Whether his beard was reddish, or any other colour I cannot say, for the razor had passed over it very closely and left a surface smoother than chalk... His blue eyes indicated both a high spirit and dignity; and his nose and nostrils breathed in the air freely; his chest corresponded to his nostrils and by his nostrils...the breadth of his chest. For by his nostrils nature had given free passage for the high spirit which bubbled up from his heart. A certain charm hung about this man but was partly marred by a general air of the horrible... He was so made in mind and body that both courage and passion reared their crests within him and both inclined to war. His wit was manifold and crafty and able to find a way of escape in every emergency. In conversation he was well informed, and the answers he gave were quite irrefutable. This man who was of such a size and such a character was inferior to the Emperor alone in fortune and eloquence and in other gifts of nature."<br>
<br>
A politique, Bohemund was resolved to engineer the enthusiasm of the crusaders to his own ends; and when his nephew Tancred left the main army at Heraclea, and attempted to establish a footing in Cilicia, the movement may have been already intended as a preparation for Bohemund's eastern principality. Bohemund was the first to get into position before Antioch (October 1097), and he took a great part in the siege of the city, beating off the Muslim attempts at relief from the east, and connecting the besiegers on the west with the port of St Simeon and the Genoese ships which lay there.<br>
<br>
The capture of Antioch was due to his connection with Firuz, one of the commanders in the city; but he would not bring matters to an issue until the possession of the city was assured him (May 1098), under the terror of the approach of Kerbogha with a great army of relief, and with a reservation in favour of Alexius, if Alexius should fulfill his promise to aid the crusaders. But Bohemund was not secure in the possession of Antioch, even after its surrender and the defeat of Kerbogha; he had to make good his claims against Raymond of Toulouse, who championed the rights of Alexius. He obtained full possession in January 1099, and stayed in the neighbourhood of Antioch to secure his position, while the other crusaders moved southward to the capture of Jerusalem.<br>
<br>
He came to Jerusalem at Christmas 1099, and had Dagobert of Pisa elected as Patriarch, perhaps in order to check the growth of a strong Lotharingian power in the city. It might seem that Bohemund was destined to found a great principality in Antioch, which would dwarf Jerusalem; he had a fine territory, a good strategical position and a strong army. But he had to face two great forces--the Byzantine Empire, which claimed the whole of his territories and was supported in its claim by Raymond of Toulouse, and the strong Muslim principalities in the north-east of Syria. Against these two forces he failed. In 1100 he was captured by Danishmend of Sivas, and he languished in prison until 1103. Tancred took his place; but meanwhile Raymond established himself with the aid of Alexius in Tripoli, and was able to check the expansion of Antioch to the south.<br>
<br>
Ransomed in 1103 by the generosity of the Armenian prince Kogh Vasil, Bohemund made it his first object to attack the neighbouring Muslim powers in order to gain supplies. But in heading an attack on Harran, in 1104, he was severely defeated at Balak, near Rakka on the Euphrates (see Battle of Harran). The defeat was decisive; it made impossible the great eastern principality which Bohemund had contemplated. It was followed by a Greek attack on Cilicia; and despairing of his own resources, Bohemund returned to Europe for reinforcements in order to defend his position. His attractive personality won him the hand of Constance, the daughter of the French king, Philip I, and he collected a large army. Of this marriage wrote Abbot Suger:<br>
<br>
    "Bohemund came to France to seek by any means he could the hand of the Lord Louis' sister Constance, a young lady of excellent breeding, elegant appearance and beautiful face. So great was the reputation for valour of the French kingdom and of the Lord Louis that even the Saracens were terrified by the prospect of that marriage. She was not engaged since she had broken off her agreement to wed Hugh, count of Troyes, and wished to avoid another unsuitable match. The prince of Antioch was experienced and rich both in gifts and promises; he fully deserved the marriage, which was celebrated with great pomp by the bishop of Chartres in the presence of the king, the Lord Louis, and many archbishops, bishops and noblemen of the realm."<br>
<br>
Dazzled by his success, Bohemund resolved to use his army not to defend Antioch against the Greeks, but to attack Alexius. He did so; but Alexius, aided by the Venetians, proved too strong, and Bohemund had to submit to a humiliating peace (the Treaty of Devol, 1108), by which he became the vassal of Alexius, consented to receive his pay, with the title of Sebastos, and promised to cede disputed territories and to admit a Greek patriarch into Antioch. Henceforth Bohemund was a broken man. He died without returning to the East, and was buried at Canosa in Apulia, in 1111.<br>

Constance of ANTIOCH
<p>
<a name ="I015168"><b>[I015168]</b></a><br />
From Wikipedia<br>
<br>
Constance of Antioch (1127-1163) was the ruler of the principality of Antioch (a crusader state) from 1130 to her death.<br>
<br>
Constance was the only daughter of Bohemund II of Antioch by his wife Alice, princess of Jerusalem. She became princess of Antioch when she was only four-years-old, under the regency of Baldwin II of Jerusalem (1130-1131) and Fulk of Jerusalem (1131-1136). Her mother Alice did not want the principality to pass to Constance, preferring to rule in her own name. Alice attempted to ally with the Muslim atabeg of Mosul, Zengi, offering to marry Constance to a Muslim prince, but the plan was foiled by Alice's father Baldwin, who exiled her from Antioch. In 1135 Alice attempted once again to take control of the principality, and sought a husband for Constance in Manuel Comnenus, at that time the heir to the Byzantine throne. Fulk exiled her again and re-established the regency for Constance. In 1136, while still a child, Constance was married to Raymond of Poitiers, whom the noble supporters of the regency had secretly summoned from Europe; Alice was tricked into believing Raymond was going to marry her, and, humiliated, left Antioch for good when the marriage was performed. From this union three children were born:<br>
    * Bohemund III of Antioch, who succeeded her in 1163<br>
    * Maria of Antioch (1145-1182), married (rechristened as "Xena") to Manuel I Comnenus<br>
    * Philippa of Antioch, mistress to Andronicus I Comnenus<br>
<br>
In 1149, Raymond died in the battle of Inab and Constance remarried in 1153 to Raynald of Chatillon, who also became co-ruler of Antioch. Constance had two daughters from Raynald:<br>
    * Agnes (1154-1184), married king Bela III of Hungary<br>
    * Alix, married Azzo V d'Este<br>
<br>
Raynald was captured in 1160 and spent the next sixteen years in a prison in Aleppo. A dispute arose between Constance and her son, Bohemund, when Bohemund tried to seize power in Antioch. A riot broke out, and Constance was exiled from the city. She died in 1163.<br>

Ingjald ANUNDSSON
<p>
<a name ="I008118"><b>[I008118]</b></a><br />
From Wikipedia<br>
<br>
Ingjaldr inn illráđi or Ingjald illråde ("ill-ruler"), ca 640 - ca 650, was a more or less historical Swedish king of the House of Ynglings. He was the son of Anund.<br>
<br>
Youth<br>
The Heimskringla relates that the viceroy of Fjädrundaland was named Ingvar and he had two sons, Alf and Agnar, who were of the same age as Ingjald. Svipdag the Blind was the viceroy of Tiundaland, the province of Uppsala where the Tings and the Yule (Midwinter) sacrifices were held.<br>
<br>
One Midwinter, when Ingjald and Alf were six years old, many people had assembled at Uppsala for the sacrifices. Alf and Ingjald played, but Ingjald found that he was the weaker boy and became so angry that he almost started to cry. His foster-brother Gautvid led him to his foster-father Svigdag the Blind and told Svipdag about Ingjald's lack of manliness and strength. Svipdag said that it was a shame and the next day he gave Ingjald a roasted wolf's heart to eat. From that day, Ingjald became a very ferocious person and had a bad disposition.<br>
<br>
Anund arranged a marriage for his son Ingjald with Gauthild, the daughter of the Geatish king Algaut, who was the son of Gautrek the Mild and the grand-son of Gaut. Gautrek consented as he believed that Ingjald had inherited his father's disposition. Gauthild's maternal grandfather was Olof the Sharp-sighted, the king of Nerike.<br>
<br>
The deceit<br>
Snorri Sturluson relates that when his father Anund had died, Ingjald became the king of Sweden. The kings at Uppsala were the foremost among the kings of the various provinces since Odin ruled the country, and they were the supreme chiefs of the other kingdoms since the death of Agne and Sweden was divided between Erik and Alrik. The descendants of these two kings had spread, cleared land and settled new territories, until there were several petty kings.<br>
<br>
In honour of his own ascendance to the throne, Ingjald invited the kings, the jarls and other important men to a grand feast in a newly built hall, just as large and sumptuous as the one in Uppsala. It was called the hall of the seven kings and had seven high seats. Algaut the Geatish king of West Götaland, King Ingvar of Fjädrundaland with his two sons Agnar and Alf, King Sporsnjall of Nerike and King Sigvat of Attundaland came but not King Granmar of Södermanland. The kings filled all seven seats but one. All the prominent people of Sweden had seats, except for Ingjald's own court whom he had sent to his old hall in Uppsala.<br>
<br>
According to the custom of the time for those who inherited kings and jarls, Ingjald rested at the footstool until the Bragebeaker was brought in. Then he was supposed to stand up, take the beaker and make solemn vows, after which he would ascend his father's high seat. However, when the beaker was brought in, he took a bull's horn and made the solemn vow that he would enlarge his own kingdom by half towards all the four quarters, towards which he pointed his horn, or die.<br>
<br>
When all the prominent guests were drunk, he ordered Svipdag's sons, Gautvid and Hylvid, to arm themselves and their men and to leave the building. Outside, they set fire to the building which burnt down and those who tried to escape were killed.<br>
<br>
Thus Ingjald made himself the sole ruler of the domains of the murdered kings.<br>
<br>
Wars<br>
Granmar won allies in his son-in-law the sea-king Hjörvard of the Ylfings and his father-in-law Högne the Geatish king of East Götaland. They successfully withstood Ingjald's invasion where Ingjald realised that the men from the provinces he had conquered were not loyal to him. After a long standstill there was peace for as long as the three kings lived. However, one night Ingjald and his men sourrounded a farm where Granmar and Hjörvard were at a feast and burnt the house down. He late disposed of five more kings, and he thus earned the name Illråde (ill-ruler) as he fulfilled his promise.<br>
<br>
Snorri Sturluson tells that it was a common saying that Ingjald killed twelve kings by deceiving them that he only wished for peace, and that he thus earned his cognomen Illråde (ill-ruler or ill-adviser).<br>
<br>
Downfall<br>
Ingjald had two children, a son Olof Trätälja and a daughter Åsa. His daughter had inherited her father's psychopathic disposition. She married king Gudröd of Skåne. Before she murdered her husband she managed to make him kill his own brother Halfdan the Kind, the father of the great Ivar Vidfamne.<br>
<br>
In order to avenge his father, Ivar Vidfamne gathered a vast host and departed for Sweden, where he found Ingjald at Ræning, probably Rällinge on the island of Fogdö in Lake Mälaren. When Ingjald and his daughter realized that it was futile to resist, they set the hall on fire and succumbed in the flames.<br>
<br>
It is interesting to note that Ynglingatal does not appear to describe Ingjald as an evil king. It calls his life a brave life frœknu fjörvi.<br>
<br>
Ingjald has often been seen as the one who unified Sweden.<br>

Eleanor of AQUITAINE
<p>
<a name ="I007533"><b>[I007533]</b></a><br />
From Wikipedia<br>
<br>
Leonora of Aquitaine (October 13, 1162 - October 31, 1214), was born as Princess Eleanor of England and became Leonora, Queen of Castile.<br>
<br>
She was born in Domfront Castle, Normandy. She was the seventh child and second daughter of King Henry II of England and his wife Queen Eleanor of Aquitaine. Her godfather was the chronicler Robert of Torigny, who had a special interest in her and recorded her life as best he could.<br>
<br>
Eleanor was a younger maternal half-sister of Marie de Champagne and Alix of France. She was a younger sister of William, Count of Poitiers, Henry the Young King, Matilda of England, Richard I of England and Geoffrey II, Duke of Brittany. She was also an older sister of Joan Plantagenet and John of England.<br>
<br>
When she was eight years old, in 1170, she was married to King Alfonso VIII of Castile. The marriage was arranged to secure the Pyrennean border, with Gascony offered as her dowry.<br>
<br>
They had 12 children:<br>
   1. Berenguela, Queen of Castile (1180-1244)<br>
   2. Sancho of Castile (1181-1181)<br>
   3. Sancha of Castile (1182-1184?)<br>
   4. Mafalda of Castile (1183?-1204)<br>
   5. Urraca of Castile (1186-1220), married King Alfonso II of Portugal<br>
   6. Blanca of Castile (1188-1252), married King Louis VIII of France<br>
   7. Fernando of Castile (1189-1211)<br>
   8. Constance of Castile (1196?-late 1190's)<br>
   9. Leonor of Castile (1200-1244), married King James I of Aragon<br>
  10. Constanza, nun at Las Huelgas (1203?-1243)<br>
  11. Henry I, King of Castile (1204-1217).<br>
<br>
Of all Eleanor of Aquitaine's daughters, her namesake Eleanor (who was called Leonor by her Spanish subjects) best inherited her mother's political influence. She reigned alongside her husband, who specified in his will that she was to rule alongside their son in the event of his death. It was she who persuaded him to marry their daughter Berenguela to the king of Leon in the interest of peace.<br>
<br>
When Alfonso died, his queen was reportedly so devastated with grief that she was unable to preside over the burial. Their daughter Berenguela instead performed these honors. Leonora then took sick and died only twenty-eight days after her husband, and was buried at Abbey de las Huelgas, in Burgos.<br>

Anne Belle ARCHIBALD
<p>
<a name ="I084266"><b>[I084266]</b></a><br />
Anne Belle Archibald (1879-1975) was born and raised in Medford, Massachusetts. Her parents were James H. Archibald (born in Musquodoboit, Nova Scotia) and Lucy L. Hoisington (born in Hartland, Vermont). Her father was a carpenter and builder who came to Medford as a young man (circa 1850) with his parents and several siblings. Jamesʼ father, Alexander K. Archibald, was a shipwright and worked in the ship-building business in Medford.<br>
Henry Adams Parkhurst (1874-1929) was born and grew up in Dunstable, Massachusetts. His parents were John A. Parkhurst (born in Dunstable) and Abbie A. Queen (born in Tyngsborough, Massachusetts). The Parkhurst family was long established in and around Dunstable and were among the organizers of a Universalist society there around 1818. Henry worked on the family farm in Dunstable as a young man. In 1903 he enrolled as a student at Tufts Divinity School, Class of 1906. Henry was ordained in February 1907 and during his ministerial career served Universalist churches in Pigeon Cove (Rockport), Massachusetts; Bethel and Springfield (and, on occasion, Felchville), Vermont; Woodsville, New Hampshire; and South Weymouth and Hardwick, Massachusetts. He died suddenly during his tenure in Hardwick.<br>
Anna Belle and Henry were the parents of two sons, Wallace A. Parkhurst (1908-1983), and John Q. Parkhurst (1912-1989). Both graduated from Tufts, Wallace in the class of 1930 and John, class of 1934, who stayed on at Crane Theological School and graduated in 1936. Wallace, a high school teacher, administrator, and coach in Massachusetts and Connecticut, was an active Universalist layperson and served as president of the Connecticut Universalist Convention in the 1950s. John was ordained in 1936 and served Universalist and Unitarian Universalist churches in Rutland, Vermont; Brookline and Waltham, Massachusetts; and Oak Park and Joliet, Illinois.<br>
Anna Belle moved away upon her marriage and did not reside in Medford thereafter. She had fond memories of growing up in Medford, a small community then, and of people and places she knew. One of her brothers, George H. Archibald, like his father a carpenter and builder, remained in Medford and raised a family. The Archibalds have two large plots in the old section of Oak Grove Cemetery; Anna Belle and Henry are among those buried there.<br>
