Andrew John SIMPKINS
<p>
<a name ="I122427"><b>[I122427]</b></a><br />
On June 21, 2007, Andrew John Simpkins Esq. passed away quietly in the intensive care unit at Kaiser Hospital in Santa Clara. He had been diagnosed with MDS - (a precursor to Leukemia), in 2006 and he ultimately passed away from complications of the Chemotherapy which he had received. Andrew was born and raised in Exeter, England and became a Fellow in the Institute of Chartered Accountants thus following his father into the profession of Accountancy. He subsequently worked for several international companies including Arthur Anderson and Hewlett Packard. He went on the start Applied Business Solutions in Silicon Valley and retired several years ago. Andrew met his wife Gretchen at a MENSA gathering in Palo Alto. They were both members of MENSA at the time. They became engaged a week after meeting and were married for over 27 years. Their first home was in Geneva, Switzerland where they were wed. Along with Jeeping in his built 1984 CJ-7, Andrew's other passions included; cooking meals from a variety of cultures, Photography, reading from his extensive home library, and enjoying Classical music (his favorite being Pavarotti). Andrew was a member of the "Getting Off" 4-wheel drive club of San Jose, CA along with the Red Rock 4-wheelers of Moab, Utah the Blue Ribbon Coalition, and the California Association of Four Wheel Drive Vehicles (CA4WDC) as that organizations treasurer for a temporary time. Always an advocate of organized, responsible four wheeling events, he was a trail official each year at the annual Easter Jeep Safari held in Moab, Utah. Andrew's favorite 4 wheel drive Jeep trail in Moab, Utah was the "Golden Spike" trail. Among Andrew's greatest accomplishments was when he had a photograph of a Jeep ascending a waterfall at Surprise Canyon in Panamint Valley, California. Published on the front page of the Los Angeles Times newspaper and on-line for over 150,000 readers and viewers to see, Andrew's photography illustrated the challenges posed by that rocky canyon which was closed by the United States Federal Government. Andrew and his wife Gretchen had purchased property at the top of the waterfalls in Panamint City, and they were petitioning the United States Park Service for access to the land they had purchased. It was his dream to someday drive his built Jeep CJ-7, or the spanking, new JK Rubicon he had planned to purchase, and travel up these waterfalls, and to the plot of land he and his wife had owned. Andrew Simpkins was proud to be an American citizen, and though he loved planning adventures with his wife and friends both south of the border and around the world, he loved to call the United States his home, and he was equally proud to be a citizen of this great country.<br>

Donald G. SIMPSON
<p>
<a name ="I019222"><b>[I019222]</b></a><br />
A longtime Vancouver attorney who wanted to be remembered as "an old-fashioned country lawyer" died Thursday.<br>
Donald Simpson, 80, collapsed at his west Vancouver home Thursday morning. The cause of death was listed as coronary artery disease. He had suffered a series of heart attacks over the past several months and was told about a month ago by doctors that there was nothing they could do for his condition.<br>
A favorite among courthouse clerks, he visited the ground-floor Superior Court Clerk's office Monday to say goodbye. Simpson said his doctor considered him a "short-timer."<br>
He leaves behind a sterling reputation both as an attorney and as a gentleman whose clients would often become his friends.<br>
Simpson earned his law degree from the University of Washington and spent a year as a law clerk for the legendary Supreme Court Justice William O. Douglas. He spent a short time with a Seattle law firm and then worked as an attorney in the U.S. Army during World War II.<br>
He decided to return to his hometown after the war and open a law office. Over the next 50 years, Simpson became something of a legend himself.<br>
"He was the epitome of what a lawyer should be," Clark County Superior Court Judge James Ladley said this morning. "He was beyond reproach and his legal ability was outstanding. He was what you would aspire to be."<br>
His father, George B. Simpson, was the only Washington Supreme Court Justice to hail from Vancouver.<br>
Father and son started their own law firm in 1951 after George Simpson lost a hard-fought re-election bid for the state's high court.<br>
George Simpson died three years later of a heart attack.<br>
Even after his father died, Don Simpson kept his dad's hand-painted name above his own on the office door at 501 W. 12th St. "I'm not going to take it off. He was my father," Simpson said in an interview last December.<br>
Clark County had purchased Simpson's property to make way for an expansion of the adjacent juvenile center.<br>
Simpson moved out last April but kept his law practice going.<br>
He moved into a new office a few blocks away in the Hi-School Pharmacy headquarters courtesy of longtime friend and Hi-School Pharmacy president Steve Oliva. Simpson told Judge Ladley last week that while his health had declined, he was still working on a couple of cases for clients.<br>
"He was just an all-around accomplished but unassuming person," said longtime friend Ken Teter of Vancouver, who was a schoolmate of Simpson's and a fellow Eagle Scout. "He had great abilities, but he didn't flaunt them."<br>
He is survived by his wife, Barbara, two children, George B. Simpson of Vancouver and Patricia Simpson of Langley, Wa.; and three grandchildren.<br>
The office door will survive, as well. His son said he plans to take it off the hinges and save it as a keepsake.<br>

He then served as an attorney with the 101st Airborne Division of the Army in Europe during World War II, and attained the rank of 2nd lieutenant.<br>
After the war he returned to Vancouver and opened a law office, where he had practiced for the last fifty years.<br>
Mr. Simpson was a member of the Clark County Bar Association, Washington State Bar Association, American College of Trust and Estate Counsel and of the Royal Oaks Country Club.<br>
He was also a life member of the Vancouver Elks 823, and had been active with the Boy Scouts of America.<br>

George Barton SIMPSON
<p>
<a name ="I003676"><b>[I003676]</b></a><br />
George Barton Simpson, who opened a law office in Vancouver in 1907 and went on to become chief justice of the Washington State Supreme Court, was a man who never could seem to do enough for his community.<br>
Simpson's list of achievements went far beyond the legal field. During his almost half-century of residency here, he was at various times a founder of the local Boy Scout movement, founder and president of the Clark county golf and Country Club, first chairman of the Clark County Game Commission and a leader in numerous other civic and service organizations.<br>
Because of his long work with the Boy Scouts, Simpson was awarded the Silver Beaver, Scouting's highest honor. Another indication of his interest in youth was the fact as juvenile court judge he helped reduce the rate of juvenile appearances in court from 12 percent in 1932 percent to 3.2 percent in 1936.<br>
Simpson also is credited with having initiated the local trout hatchery.<br>
Born Aug. 12, 1881, in Pomeroy, Wash., Simpson came to Vancouver in 1907 right after graduation from the Willamette University School of Law. He was elected Vancouver City attorney in 1915 and in three years in that position never lost a case.<br>
In 1920, Simpson became a judge of the Superior Court and held this position until 1937 when he was appointed to the state Supreme Court. He was elected in 1938 and again in 1944 and served two terms as chief justice.<br>
In the election of 1950, Simpson finally was defeated for re-election. He returned to Vancouver, where he practiced law with his son Donald, until his death in June of 1954 at age 72.<br>

Katherine Ann SIMPSON
<p>
<a name ="I079443"><b>[I079443]</b></a><br />
Katie Hammond , who often joked that her offspring were so prolific they were overpopulating Northern California, has died at 102. <br>
The Auburn resident had been in good spirits and excellent health right up to the day she died in her sleep Oct. 7, said granddaughter Laurie Stark. <br>
In addition to three children, she had 12 grandchildren, 18 great-grandchildren and 22 great-great-grandchildren. <br>
Mrs. Hammond , a native of El Dorado County, lived virtually all her life in the Auburn-Bowman area. <br>
She drove until she was 92, ate and drank in moderation, took a vigorous walk every day, and lived independently until she was 100, her granddaughter said. <br>
"She also had all her teeth, she took good care of them," Stark said. "She was proud of that. <br>
"One of her goals was to live in three centuries, and she achieved that," her granddaughter added. "She loved people, enjoyed doing things for others, and was very involved with her grandchildren and great-grandchildren. She loved to tease them. <br>
"You couldn't ask for more. She had a nice life and then passed away in her sleep." <br>
Katherine Ann Hammond was born Aug. 18, 1899, the second of five children of the former Alice Myers and Edward Simpson, a miner and farmer. <br>
Mrs. Hammond 's mother died when she was 7, and she began running the household for her father when she was 11. She graduated from Placer Union High School in 1919, the same year she married Lester "Pop" Hammond . <br>
During her married life, she and her husband, who preceded her in death, ran a dairy and built more than two dozen stone houses along what is now the Interstate 80 corridor between Auburn and Clipper Gap. <br>
Mrs. Hammond kept the books and cooked for the work crews while her husband supervised construction of the stone houses and hundreds of stone walls and fireplaces. <br>
"They used salvaged material to build those houses," Stark said, "anything that was handy. I live in one of those houses, which has slate walls, a petrified wood fireplace and a staircase fashioned from recycled snow shed timber." <br>
Survivors include daughters Barbara Eichel of Auburn and Elva Smith of Half Moon Bay. <br>
A memorial service is scheduled for 10 a.m. Saturday in Pioneer United Methodist Church, 1338 Lincoln Way, Auburn. <br>

Dorothy Elaine SINCLAIR
<p>
<a name ="I097988"><b>[I097988]</b></a><br />
Dorothy "Elaine" (Sinclair) Ferren passed in her sleep peacefully on August 5, 2010, at Merrimack County Nursing Home, New Hampshire. She was weeks shy of her 97th birthday. A resident of Newbury since the 1950's, she shared a full and active life with her husband of over 75 years, George G. Ferren, who, after being the holder of Newbury's "Oldest Citizen Cane", died at 99 on August 22, 2005, at Pine Rock Nursing Home in New Hampshire. Dorothy was born in the small, Aroostook County town of Mapleton, Maine, the fourth of seven children, to Herbert Austin Sinclair (a potato farmer and outdoorsman) and Grace Hume. The Humes trace their lineage to medieval times and still celebrate with occasional clan gatherings. Dorothy excelled in school, earning two 'double promotions'. As a youth, she and her sisters formed the Singing Sinclair Girls who entertained at family and church gatherings. She was adept at snow-shoe racing and excelled in hog-callinga skill that served her well later in life, as she signaled dinner to her children playing in the far fields and woods. Products of the wars and the great depression, George and "Dot" reared five children in North Reading, Massachusetts. After the war, with the children well along, she studied nutrition at the University of Massachusetts and became a school cook and dietician. She treated the school kids to down-home, nutritious food unheard of in previous school lunch offerings. Dorothy was a very active, expert marksman in the North Reading Women's Rifle Club, and competed in many regional "matches' winning many medals. Skiing became the Ferrens' life shortly after they moved to Newbury, and they were familiar faces at Mt. Sunapee and the original King Ridge rope tow. Later, they invested in the "new" King Ridge and brought many skiers to the slopes. They later became the Ski Patrol "ambassadors" and helped many a stranded skier. They skied the Alps in Austria and Switzerland in the 60's, and the Rockies in the 70's. They were still skiing in THEIR 70's! Dorothy was an able seamstress, who excelled in needlepoint and quilt making. She remained active at home, cheering the Red Sox and damning the Yankees, until just a short time ago when she moved to Merrimack County Nursing Home. She will be remembered for her great cooking (especially the doughnuts), insightful wit and disarming one liners that were always "right-on". Her children are Robert (deceased), Janet Capaldi of Arizona, Nick of Newbury and Thailand, George Jr. of Newbury and Dwight of Colorado. This fun loving lady will be missed by her family, extending to great grandchildren, as well as the many friends who knew and loved her. Calling hours are on Wednesday, August 11 from 2-3pm at Chadwick Funeral Home, 235 Main Street, New London, NH (603) 526-6442. Immediately following (3:30), there will be a graveside interment service at the West Part Cemetery, County Road, New London, NH.<br>

William Merz SINTON
<p>
<a name ="I030061"><b>[I030061]</b></a><br />
William Sinton died on Tuesday the 16th of March 2004.<br>
Bill Sinton, one of the pioneers of infrared planetary astronomy, died at his home in Flagstaff, Arizona, on March 16th 2004, at the age of 78.<br>
Bill was born in Baltimore on April 11, 1925. He developed lifelong interests in railroads and radios while still a child, and by age 15 he had already built a shortwave radio receiver and won his ham radio license. His abiding interest in electronic and mechanical devices would serve him well in his professional career. He fought with the 26th Infantry Division in the Second World War and was wounded in France in October 1944. After the war he obtained his bachelor's degree in physics at Johns Hopkins (1949). His doctoral work at the same institution, with John Strong, gave him his first taste of infrared astronomy, including the first measurements of the moon at 1-millimeter wavelength. He obtained his PhD, on the infrared spectrum and temperature of Venus, in 1953.<br>
During a 1-year postdoc at Johns Hopkins he probed the lunar subsurface by observing the cooling of the moon during eclipse at millimeter wavelengths, and observed the diurnal variation in Martian surface temperatures in the 10-micron window. He joined Harvard College Observatory as a research associate and lecturer in 1954, and became interested in the question of life on Mars and the then-plausible possibility that Mars's dark markings were due to vegetation. In 1956, using a monochromator that he built himself, he detected absorptions near 3.4 microns in the Martian spectrum which he attributed to a C-H stretch transition in Martian vegetation. These "Sinton bands," as they came to be known, sparked great interest at the time, and though at least some of the spectral structure was later found to be due to terrestrial HDO, and the presence of abundant organic molecules on the Martian surface was finally ruled out by the Viking landers, some of the spectral features that he detected appear to be intrinsic to Mars and are still not well understood.<br>
<br>
In 1957, Bill moved to Lowell Observatory, and spent the next nine years there. He considered these to be the most productive years of his career. In his time at Lowell, he continued his studies of the Moon's thermal emission, and built an infrared Michelson interferometer spectrometer that he put to use in identifying the 3.1-micron water of hydration band on Mars. He also met and married his wife Marge in 1960, and their three sons, Bob, David, and Alan were born during the Flagstaff years.<br>
<br>
In 1965, Bill was invited by John Jefferies to join the faculty of the University of Hawaii, and to help in the development of the fledgling Mauna Kea Observatory. His work on the design the 88-inch telescope on Mauna Kea, the cornerstone of the observatory, included designing its telescope control system, making it one of the first computer-controlled optical telescopes. His scientific work at the Institute for Astronomy included continued studies of Mars, with his PhD student Terry Martin, as well as the infrared spectrum of Uranus and Neptune. He sometimes translated his pseudocolored maps of the thermal emission from the planets, pixel by pixel, into the unique medium of stained glass. In 1979, following the discovery of Io's volcanoes by Voyager, he obtained some of the first ground-based observations of the infrared thermal emission from the volcanoes. He devoted the last decade of his career to the ground-based study of Io's volcanoes, working to characterize their time variability and developing techniques to identify their locations on Io. He was one of the founding members of the International Jupiter Watch in 1987, and was the first leader of its Satellite Discipline.<br>
<br>
When he retired from the University of Hawaii in 1990, he and Marge returned to Flagstaff, and he renewed his association with Lowell Observatory as an adjunct astronomer. He built a miniature steam-powered railroad around his house, to the delight of the neighborhood children who would get to ride on it on special occasions. In 1993 he was diagnosed with ALS (Lou Gehrig's disease), and was confined to a wheelchair shortly afterwards, but he continued to attend scientific meetings, and to contribute to Lowell Observatory as a member of its Advisory Board, till shortly before his death. In 2002 he published an autobiography, I Choose to Live, which described his life and his battle with ALS. Because he could no longer use a keyboard he wrote the entire book using voice-recognition software- a testament to his determination to keep as active and productive as possible despite the encroachments of the disease.We remember Bill as a warm, gentle, and enthusiastic man with an encyclopedic knowledge of all things infrared. He had a love of mechanical gadgets of all types, whether he was designing plumbing for a He3 cooled germanium bolometer or for a model steam engine. He is greatly missed by his family, friends, and former colleagues.<br>
Within two weeks of Bill's death came the announcement that CH4 gas had been discovered on Mars by the Mars Express spacecraft, confirming similar results from ground-based telescopes. The methane, touted as possible evidence for extant Martian life, was discovered via its 3.3-micron C-H stretch band. This is essentially the same vibrational transition, potentially carrying the same hints of living Martian organisms, which Bill thought he had seen on Mars 45 years earlier. So while Bill's initial conclusion that Mars is covered with extensive vegetation turned out to be wrong, his insight that the 3-micron region, with its telltale signature of carbon-hydrogen bonds, was the best place to search for evidence of life on our sister world, may have been right all along.<br>

William Merz Sinton died March 16, 2004, after a 10-year battle with Lou Gehrig's Disease. He was 78.<br>
Sinton was born in Baltimore, Md. After serving as an infantryman in Europe during World War II, he earned his bachelor's and doctorate degrees in physics from John Hopkins University. He later taught at Harvard University.<br>
In 1957 he became an astronomer at Lowell Observatory in Flagstaff, where he married Marjorie Korner.<br>
Later they moved to Honolulu, where he became professor of physics and astronomy and helped design the first large telescope for the top of 13,800-foot Mauna Kea. After retiring in 1990, he moved back to Flagstaff. During his lifetime he published over 100 scientific papers and two books.<br>
He is survived by his wife and sons Robert, David (Melissa Siders), Alan (Sandra), a grandson, Aaron and a cousin. He is also survived by his caregivers, Tina Winscott, Lee Mitchelson and Barbara Redsteer, whom he loved as family.<br>
