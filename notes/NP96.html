<p>
<a name ="I015726"><b>[I015726]</b></a><br />
The Seneca Falls Reveille of October 80th has the following report of the death of- Albert Cook, of Seneca Falls, formerly a resident of this town:<br>
The intelligence of the death of Albert Cook, president of the Partridge Banking house in this village, which was received here early last Wednesday evening, was a shock to the entire community. He died of heart disease at the Park Avenue hotel in New York at about 6 o'clock, after a somewhat protracted illness, aged 62 years. The deceased was born in Cortland County, and came to Seneca Falls while quite a young man and entered the employ of the late Erastus Partridge, who was then engaged in the mercantile trade. It was here that he acquired a knowledge of the business and of business methods which served him so successfully in after life. In 1847, he was married to Caroline, eldest daughter of Mr. Partridge, after which he engaged in trade at Wolcott, Wayne county, where he remained until the close of the war, when he disposed of his business and removed to Lockport, where he continued the mercantile business. In August 1873, after the death of Mr. Partridge, he returned to this village, and became vice-president of the First National bank of Seneca Falls. On January 14,1870, he was elected president of the bank, to fill the vacancy occasioned by the death of Leroy C. Partridge. Upon Mr. Cook as executor and trustee, mainly devolved the responsibility of the care and settlement of the estate of Erastus Partridge, In the discharge of this duty he exhibited the same caution and tact and honesty of purpose that characterized him in his business as a painstaking and successful merchant He was conservative in his views, honorable in his dealings and faithful in the performance of every trust. The First National bank of which Mr. Cook was president closed in November 1880, and the banking business was continued by him as executor under the name of the Partridge Banking House. In October, 1882, Mr. Cook purchased the bank of the estate, and has since continued it us an individual enterprise. Mr. Cook was an intelligent, prudent and substantial businessman, enjoying the confidence of all who knew him. His death is a severe blow to the business interest of the community, and is deeply regretted. In his social relations he was genial, kind and affable - a man among men. He was a man who formed strong ties of friendship, those who knew him best esteemed him most highly. He had many warm personal friends, and it will be long before they will cease to mourn and sorrow for his loss. Faithful and full of tender solicitude as a father, loving and consistent as a husband, kind and sympathetic as a friend, his death is a painful bereavement. His domestic virtues, his personal excellence of character, and his exemplary life will be treasured and remembered by a wide circle of friends. His wife and daughter survive him, and in their bereavement they have the sympathy of the entire community.<br>
The remains readied here for burial this morning, and the funeral will take place at the residence of General George M. Guiom on Cayuga street, next Sunday at 2:30 p.m.<br>
