Robert Harold HERTZBERGER
<p>
<a name ="I031175"><b>[I031175]</b></a><br />
His dream may have been on the pitcher's mound as a professional baseball player, but Robert H. Hertzberger opted instead for a career in public service, a decision that offered him something with "a little more promise."<br>
Hertzberger, 70, who served 20 years on the Evansville Police Department, died Tuesday, June 20, 2000, at Highland Pointe Healthcare.<br>
He had been at the health care facility for about four weeks, said his wife, Barbara Hertzberger, who is also a retired police officer.<br>
Her husband played professional baseball with the Milwaukee Braves organization after graduation from Reitz High School, where he played on the state championship football team and lettered in basketball and track.<br>
But when Hertzberger gave up on professional baseball, the former All-American athlete came home.<br>
Baseball's loss was Evansville's gain, and at the suggestion of his father, he went on to join the Evansville Police Department, from where he retired in 1974.<br>
He had a lengthy career in law enforcement and public service.<br>
"He was extremely well organized, very personable," said attorney Jeffrey Lantz.<br>
"He didn't know anybody who wasn't a friend."<br>
Hertzberger worked as Lantz's chief investigator and office manager while Lantz was Vanderburgh County prosecutor .<br>
Hertzberger was appointed by the local Republican Party to fill a vacant city clerk's position in 1979, but lost his bid for the job in the general election.<br>
He also lost a bid for county treasurer in 1976, and served as administrator of the Voters Administration Office.<br>
He also served as manager of Burdette Park.<br>
He served in various leadership positions at the local and international levels of Civitan International, receiving both the Mr. Civitan Award and the International Honor Key, the group's highest honor.<br>
As a life member of the Hadi Shrine Temple, he served as recorder for 14 years and was made recorder emeritus in 1989. He was also a member of the Lessing Masonic Lodge and Evansville Scottish Rite.<br>
"He was one of those types of guys, that if something had to be done he wanted to do it," said Mike Trible, a past potentate of the Temple for whom Hertzberger worked as an aide.<br>
"He was always comfortable. You enjoyed being around him. There was no pretension or animosity. He was just a friend."<br>
Among his many community activities, Hertzberger coached Junior League Football and served as director of the Police Athletic League camp for developmentally disabled children.<br>
Also surviving are a daughter, Phyllis Ann Morris of California; two sons, Charles E. and Robert L., both of Evansville; and a grandson, Chad Addison Hertzberger.<br>
Services will be at 10 a.m. Friday at Alexander Funeral Home North Chapel, the Rev. James T. Heady officiating, with burial in Onton Cemetery in Onton, Ky.<br>
Friends may call from 2 to 8 p.m. Thursday, with a Masonic service at 7 p.m. and an FOP memorial service following, at the funeral home.<br>
