Dr. Arthur M. Clapp, one of the foremost specialists on electrical therapeutics in the City of Springfield, Mass., was electrocuted accidently by a high frequency coil in his office, at 6 Chestnut Street, on the evening of Wednesday,  October 31st. Approximately fifty  thousand volts, the full load of the  street line connection, passed through  his body, causing almost instant death.  His body was found lying in the doorway leading from his waiting room to his inner office. Both his hands were clasped around the vibrating machine, which was running at full power. Just how the accident occurred is not known, but it is believed to have been due to unfamiliarity with the machine, resulting in a sudden release of greater voltage than could be withstood. He was testing out a Morgan high frequency coil used for X-ray and electrical purposes. The ordinary load of the electrical wire in his office was one hundred and ten volts, but recently he had connection made with the main electrical wire on State Street. Dr. Clapp was widely known in Springfield and locality.  He was a member of the staff of the Springfield Hospital and enjoyed a wide practice. For the past two years he was physician at the Hampden County Jail.   He was a native of Northampton and was forty-one years old. He was born March 1, 1876, and prepared for college at the Northampton schools. Dr. Clapp received his medical training at the Albany Medical School and at the Harvard Medical School, graduating from the latter school in 1902. After graduation, he served as an interne at Springfield Hospital and began active practice at Ware. He remained there for six months and then located in Springfield in 1904. Last August, he underwent an operation for gallstones in one of the Boston hospitals, returning only about four weeks to his practice before his death.  Dr. Clapp was married in 1905 to Miss Edith W. Bates, of Northampton, who survives him with a son, Harrison, five years old. He was a member of the Springfield Clinical Club; the Springfield Academy of Medicine; the Massachusetts Medical Society; and the Phi Kappa Psi fraternity. <br>

Luther L. CLAPP
<p>
<a name ="I020182"><b>[I020182]</b></a><br />
LUTHER CLAPP, retired farmer ; P. O. Chatham Center. Among the representative farmers and self-made men of this township, is the above-mentioned gentleman, who was born Jan. 20, 1813, in Chesterfield Township, Hampshire Co., Mass., son of Ira Clapp, who was born March 14, 1783, and was a son of Amasa, whose great-grandfather was an Englishman, and came to this country three years subsequent to the landing of the Pilgrim Fathers. From this gentleman and his brother, who came with him, have descended a numerous progeny. To Ira Clapp was born a family of five children, three sons and two daughters, who are Levi and Luther, of this township ; Sophronia, Dorothy and Ira yet remain on the homestead in Massachusetts. The Clapp family are generally farmers as a class, and of the successful kind, to which vocation our subject was, in early life, quite thoroughly drilled, as well as in the fundamental rules of a common-school education. Aug. 31, 1837, he was united in matrimony to Hannah Jackson, who was born Feb. 25, 1818, in Northampton, Mass. ; she was a daughter of. Benjamin and Electa (Miller) Benjamin, she being a native of England. Immediately after the marriage of Mr. Clapp, he came West, having, when he started, $300 in money, which he had earned prior to his marriage, working out by the month, which he invested upon his arrival, buying one-half interest in his brother Levi's land and stock and tools, he having preceded him one year ; thus engaged in partnership, they continued in this relation for twelve years, at which time there was a division, and each assumed absolute control over their own individual affairs. To Mr. Clapp have been born four children, who are Caroline, since the wife of Jonathan Beach, of this township ; Ellen, now Mrs. Silas Moody, of Gratiot Co., Mich. ; Adelaide, Mrs. John B. Whitney, and Dyer A., who now resides on the home farm, which consists of 235 acres. Mr. Clapp is now retired from active business, having been successful in his career as a farmer and business man. Mr. Clapp's parents never came to this country to settle, but died in Massachusetts, he Jan. 27, 1850, she Dec. 26, same year, and was, for many years, a member of the Congregational Church. Mr. Luther Clapp and wife, since the spring of 1841. have been members of the same church as that of his parents. His father's family were all very temperate, neither using intoxicating liquors of any kind, or even tobacco, which example has since been ever followed by his descendants, even down to his grandchildren. Although a stanch and standard Republican, yet he has never craved publicity in the official relations of his township, and has declined all invitations to public honors, and been content and best satisfied to remain in the quiet walks of life. His sound judgment and ripe experience in business affairs. and, pertaining to agricultural matters, are worthy of the emulation and practice of the rising generation. He is a liberal patron of the public journals, there being over a dozen of papers and periodicals taken in his family. Has been a patron of the Cleveland Leader and New York Independent since their commencement.<br>

Bradford J Clark, 90, passed away Tuesday, September 20, 2016 at Sangre De Christo Hospice in Pueblo, Colorado. <br>
Brad was born October 26, 1925 to Bradford J Clark, Sr. and Sarah Francis Conrad in Great Falls, Montana. Their only child, he graduated Valedictorian from Fort Shaw High School in 1943. The summer after graduation, Brad worked for the Forestry service at Indian Point near his home, manning a fire lookout and maintaining trails.<br>
Brad was inducted into the Army Air Corp on December 8, 1943 and served in WWII as a B-17 turret gunner. Following his tour of duty, he attended Doane College in Crete, Nebraska, where he was actively involved in drama club, the debate team and played lineman on the football team. He graduated with a degree in history in 1949. He married his sweetheart, Berdena Elaine Lincoln on June 2, 1948, in Grinnell, Iowa<br>
Brad initiated a long career in education, beginning in Walsenburg, Colorado for two years, then Ovid, Colorado for four years. He obtained a Masters Degree in education from Colorado State College in Greeley, Colorado before serving as Principal at Haxtun Grade School, Haxtun, Colorado, for twenty-seven years until his retirement in 1982. During his tenure there, he was the broadcaster at football games, track meets, and official basketball time and scorekeeper. He often allowed one or two children to assist him which was a memorable experience. <br>
Brad loved to spend time with his family on annual summer vacation trips. It was always comical stuffing all the kids, gear, and Grandma Clark into a station wagon. Brad was actively involved in the Haxtun Lions Club, serving as Tail Twister. He was a devoted member of the Gideons for over fifty years, serving in several leadership roles. Many of our fondest childhood memories occurred while attending the annual Gideon state conventions held at Covenant Heights in Estes Park, Colorado. He was an example to all in his devotion to the Lord.<br>
Many of his retirement years were spent in Sterling gardening, farming, singing with the Barbershop Choir and building an earth-bermed home with his wife. In retirement the family annually spent time together with Brad and Elaine at their timeshare. Moving from Sterling, Brad an Elaine resided on the Front Range near Castle Rock.<br>

Carol CLARK
<p>
<a name ="I081688"><b>[I081688]</b></a><br />
Carol Clark Ford danced all her life.<br>
The young girl from Topeka Kansas danced her way into a soda shop in rural Kansas and found, in all things in her life, a life-long dance partner in soda jerk, Don Ford. Don and Carol started a distant correspondence broken by irregular visits swinging to the big bands at Forbes Air Force base in Topeka.<br>
After returning from military service they soon knew they wanted to marry, but decided to wait until Don finished college. They couldn't wait a day more. On the day of his graduation from Kansas State University on Memorial Day, 1948, they wed.<br>
In 1952 they moved to Penn State and found their first home in Lemont where Carol soon became involved in women's organizations and embraced the "Happy Valley" community.<br>
Carol and Don danced together throughout their lives. Later in life as Carol's Alzheimer disease advanced and she could no longer walk, they found, with Don supporting her, that dancing together in their home was something they could still enjoy. They danced together nearly every day until her death on Aug. 27, 2011. She was 83.<br>
Along with dancing Carol had a passion for the arts. She loved to sing and to express her creativity through painting and crafts. Her love of music began with learning to play piano as a child and singing as she played. She would instill that same love of music in her four sons.<br>
Singing with others was a great joy of Carol's and over the years she sang with the Lemont Women's Club, the State College Choral Society, Sweet Adeline's barbershop group, and the choir at State College Presbyterian Church. Over the past few years, despite her limitations, she would sit next to the piano smiling and humming along as family sang her favorite songs or listened to her favorite choral work, the Halleluiah Chorus from Handel's Messiah. Carol may have been best known in her community for her paintings and crafts which attracted interest at both local arts festivals and her home studio, the "Personal Touch". She used the profits to support the development of non-profit programs designed to strengthen the "Happy Valley" community. She provided start-up and growth money for development initiatives such as a hospital based infant evaluation center; a family planning center; Meals on Wheels; a volunteer action center; children, youth, and family services; the Women's Resource Center; community alternatives for criminal justice; and Alzheimer's support groups.<br>
<br>
Along with her personal activities, Carol also played an important role in helping Don create and develop Penn State's Division of Counseling (now the Division of Undergraduate Studies) and the College of Human Development (now the College of Health and Human Development). Her involvement in recruiting faculty and staff and in providing opportunities for social gatherings with their families created a culture of caring and collaboration that exists today. Don and Carol established the Carol Clark Ford Staff Award in the College of Health and Human Development as a way to celebrate those that continue to contribute to developing the culture they built together for over twenty years.<br>
Carol's most caring, joyous and creative efforts involved her large and loving family. She had four sons with husband Dr. Donald H. Ford, former Dean of the College of Health and Human Development. Russell was born in the prairies of Kansas in 1951 and lives in Hershey with his wife Barb. Carol wanted a larger family and was surprised with twins in the summer of 1954. Douglas and his wife Pam live in State College and his twin brother Martin and his wife Sheri live in Clifton, Virginia. In 1962 her fourth son joined the all male crew. Cameron and his wife Gricel Fernandez live in Orlando, Florida. It wasn't until twelve grandchildren and three great grandchildren (and a fourth on the way) did she finally get her girls and break the all male Ford tradition.<br>
Carol was a caring wife, a supportive mother and grandmother who, despite an increasing loss of capabilities, enjoyed a long, loving, and courageous life and even now continues to dance.<br>
Visitation will be 3-5 p.m. on Sunday, Sept. 4th, 2011 at Koch Funeral Home, 2401 South Atherton St., State College. A Memorial service will held at 1:30 p.m. on Monday, Sept. 5th, at the Unitarian Universalist Fellowship of Centre County, 780 Waupelani Drive Extension, State College.<br>
In lieu of flowers, memorial contributions could be made to State College Meals on Wheels, P.O. Box 1235, State College, PA 16804, Doctors Without Borders, 333 7th Avenue, 2nd floor, New York, NY 10001-5004, or other groups who reflect Carol's wish to support opportunities for volunteers to help their communities.<br>

Chapin DeWitt CLARK
<p>
<a name ="I081656"><b>[I081656]</b></a><br />
A memorial service for Chapin D. Clark, retired University professor and law school dean, will be held at 2 p.m. Oct. 13 at Beall Concert Hall.<br>
Clark died Friday during a guided fishing trip on the Rogue River when the drift boat he was in hit a rock, causing him and several of the other passengers to fall overboard. He was 71.<br>
He began teaching at the University School of Law in 1962. He became a professor emeritus in 1991, the year before he retired. His colleagues describe him as a great contributor to the community and to the Universityʼs legal resources.<br>
"He was instrumental in changing this from a traditional state law school to one of national dimensions," law Professor Dominick Vetri said.<br>
"He was a friendly, warm, comfortable person to deal with," Vetri said. "He was extremely intelligent and witty."<br>
Clark, who practiced environmental law and specialized in policies dealing with water resources, helped found the Ocean and Coastal Law program and worked to create advanced environmental courses.<br>
Vetri said Clark was responsible for guiding the law school through a difficult financial period when he served as dean from 1974 to 1980.<br>
In 1986, the University honored Clark with the Charles Johnson Memorial Award.<br>
Vetri said Clark earned the award because of his commitment and willingness to stand up for issues such as free speech and <br>
as academic freedom.<br>
The well-known former dean officially retired in 1992, but came back to teach part-time until 1995.<br>
"Virtually every lawyer in the state knows his name," Vetri said.<br>
As an active member of the American Bar Association, Clark helped the law school several years ago when the number of University law graduates passing the bar dipped, colleagues said. He headed a committee to develop a plan of action and write a report.<br>
Law Professor Jim Mooney said professors analyzed the report to structure new tutoring programs. Mooney said these programs were responsible for increasing student scores on the bar exam by as much as 10 or 20 percent.<br>
Clark helped students while he pioneered new programs for the law school.<br>
"We always had him in mind as a great source for this institution," Vetri said, "and itʼs a great loss that heʼs gone."<br>
Mooney agreed.<br>
"I never heard anyone say a bad word about Chapin Clark," Mooney said. "He was one of those people that everyone liked and respected, and thatʼs rare. Thatʼs rare."<br>
Clark is survived by his wife, Dorothy, and two children, Juliakay and Jeffrey.<br>
