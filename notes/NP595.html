William WITTER
<p>
<a name ="I031894"><b>[I031894]</b></a><br />
William Witter, the first American ancestor of the Witter family of the United States and Canada, was born in England about the year 1584, as he was seventy-five when he died in 1659. His surname is one of the earliest found in New England and appears in various forms in the old records of this country and of England, -- as Witter, Whitter, Witton, and Whitton. One branch of the Whitter or Witter, family was of Broomehall, in Sussex, England, in the reign of Edward IV. A descendant of this family was Thomas Whitter of Exeter, Devonshire, who was an officer in Cromwell's army. This affiliation with he Parliamentary Party, and hence with the Puritan movement, which contributed largely to the settlement of New England, may indicate a probable connection between the Devonshire family and the Witters of Early Massachusetts, Connecticut and Rhode Island, of which William Witter was the first American Ancestor.<br>
William was living in Massachusetts as early as 1639, at which date he was probably of Swampscott, near Lynn. At a later period he was a resident of Swampscott, although his i mention in some of the records of Lynn. THe record of this arrival in New England is preserved in an old manuscript, written by his descendant, Samuel Witter, of the sixth generation, entitled: "The Genaligy of the Witters from their first arival fromm England to America, drawn from the Original, March the 20th AD 1773 by Samuel Witter", and the first entry is as follows:<br>
"William Witter in his voiage from old England to America with his wife his son Josiah & daughter Hannah, arrived at Lynn in the Massachusetts Bay, where Josiah married Elisabeth Wheeler and Hannah married Thomas Barden. Said William Witter died at Lynn, his Widows Name was Hannah. She came with her Son Josiah to Stonington and Lived to a Great Age."<br>
