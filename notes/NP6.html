She attended Otterbein College (BA in Education), where she met Hugh. She later attended The Ohio State University, where she earned a Masters of Arts in Education as a reading specialist. Elizabeth taught in elementary schools in Cincinnati OH, Minneapolis MN, and Columbus OH. She treasured her students. In Arizona, she was elected President of the Catalina Foothills School Board. She served as a Trustee and President of the Alumni Association for Otterbein College. Elizabeth loved spending time with her family and in her gardens, and made lifelong friendships on every journey. She taught gold panning in Sabino Canyon, hiked the Grand Canyon, started internationally competitive chess teams (without playing chess), and created a home that welcomed all. She gracefully fought a devastating neuromuscular disease that eventually claimed her. As the pillar of our family, she will be sorely missed. A service will be held at Church of the Master United Methodist Church in Westerville, Ohio on August 5, 2017 . She will be interred at the Otterbein Cemetery.<br>

Samuel ALLEN
<p>
<a name ="I004003"><b>[I004003]</b></a><br />
Second marriage to Sarah Partridge between 1653 and 1683?<br>
<br>
Samuel Allen was made freeman in 1683 and was more than 80 years old at his death in 1791, per Savage. Samuel and his wife are mentioned in Winthrop's Medical Journal, his wife of 17 1/2 years, "hath been but half year married, G[oodman] Woodfords daughter." This entry was dated at Northampton 1659, but Jacobus believes it was more likely 1660.<br>
<br>
"Samuel Allen came to Northampton in 1657. A public meeting of the settlers held Dec. 19, 1657, assigned him a home lot on King street. The house soon reared upon it, having received at intervals many additions and improvements, stood on the left hand corner of what is now called Edwards street, but formerly by name less historic, viz: Back Lane. In 1659, the house being in readiness, he married the daughter of his next neighbor on the south. This homestead remained in the line of his descendants till 1805, a period of 150 years." (from The Allen Memorial, pg. 15)<br>
<br>
Samuel's will was dated 16 June 1712 with a codicil 3 Jan. 1715. It was proved 16 Dec. 1710 and names his wife to have use of the entire estate or as much as she needs during her life, sons Samuel and Thomas (several pieces of land given to son Thomas descended "to my wife from her father Thomas Woodford dec'd"), children of son Joseph (Noah and Elizabeth), daughter Hannah's children, daughters Sarah Miller and Mindwell, sons Samuel and Thomas executors.<br>

<a name ="I004393"><b>[I004393]</b></a><br />
According to "Samuel Allen of Windsor, CT," NEHGS "Register," Vol 30, pg. 444 and Allen Family Papers, pg. 19, Samuel was born in Braintree, Essex, England, in about 1588, although other, more recent sources give his birth as about 1608. Jacobus disagrees and believes that he was more likely born about 1608, about age 60 at his death. He allegedly came to Cambridge in 1632 and removed to CT in 1635 where he settled at Windsor. He was likely brother to Deacon Thomas Allyn/Allen of Middletown, CT, but not likely related to Col. Matthew Allyn of Cambridge and Windsor and Thomas Allen of Barnstable who were brothers. These relationships are confirmed in The Allen Memorial which quotes numerous sources in stating that Samuel and Thomas were brother and that they had no known relationship to Matthew and Samuel of Braintree.<br>
<br>
From the Allen Memorial, pg. 14: "...the first undoubted official record of Samuel Allen is found in the<br>
Windsor land records as follows:<br>
<br>
"January 27, 1640, Samuel Allen hath granted from the plantation at Windsor, Conn., 1st An house lot, being six acres, three rods, ten poles, bounded from the rivulet to the west by Rodger Ludlow on the south, by Thomas Marshall on the north, and runs in length to the west into a highway laid out into some part of the lot of said Rodger Ludlow and his, the said Samuel Allen."<br>
<br>
"2d In Plymouth meadow, four acres, bounded by Bray Rossiter on the north and a rivulet that runs into the great river on the south. 3d Toward Hartford, nineteen acres, more or less, and runs in length to the Great River to the west one hundred and thirty and four rods, and is bounded by John Witchfield on the north and by Thomas Marshfield on the south. 4th Over the Great River next to the same, fifteen rods in bredth, in the length to the east three miles; bounded by Joseph Lumus on the south, John Hurd on the north."<br>
<br>
Samuel Allen may have been at Windsor as early as 1636 and his land was entered 27 Jan. 1641 and included a house lot of over 6 acres. Samuel was a juryman 5 March 1645 and was a farmer. He died and was buried at Windsor 28 April 1648, leaving a widow and 6 children. The inventory of his estate was taken 8 Sept. 1648 and totaled 76 pounds, 18 shillings and 8 pence. His wife married a second time, to Wm. Hurlbut, and removed to Northampton, MA. His tombstone at the Enfield Street Cemetery, Enfield, CT indicated "1588-1648."<br>
