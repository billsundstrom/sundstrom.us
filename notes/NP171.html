In Brother-In-Law始s Home<br>
Vancouver, Wash., Aug. 8 (Special)-<br>
Placing a .32 caliber revolver to his head, Elmer Falk, 46, of route 5 Vancouver, committed suicide in the second-story bedroom of his brother-in-law始s home early today.  No one was home at the residence of Frank Fitch when Falk took his live.<br>
His family told Corner E. H. Rider that Falk left home about 8 0始clock to do some clearing work in the woods near his house, but that when he did not return home at noon they became worried and started a search for him.  His body was fournd Emerson Burdick and Sheldon Page after a brief search.  <br>
He had gone into the woods and had fired one shot from a double-barreled shotgun, but without effect.  Then he proceeded to  the Fitch home, where he obtained a ladder and climbed through the second floor window to end his live.  He was committed to the state hospital several months ago, but was released after about a month始s treatment.<br>
Mr. Falk had been an employee in the Vancouver post office department for many years and was on duty as usual Friday.<br>
The Oregonian,  9 August 1936<br>
</p>
Carl Henry Sundstrom FALK
<p>
<a name ="I003273"><b>[I003273]</b></a><br />
The following is from a letter written by one of his daughters:<br>
     Carl Henry Falk had many adventures as a sailor. He said when he was a little boy in Sweden, they used to play where they could see the sail boats coming and going. And for several years before he started out, in the morning he wanted to go but by nighttime he was glad to stay home. He left Sweden before his parents (1871) and sailed for over two years. He jumped overboard at a port in France and swam ashore and went thru the gates with the workingmen and went out on another boat.  This was at Xmas time and he only had what he wore.  It was winter and he had no shoes, but a couple of old Scandinavian sailors gave him some of their clothes, and he made a coat out of some old sails.  He visited several African ports and sailed around Cape Horn.  He saw his firs watermelon in Africa.  They grew wild there and the natives brought them to the boat. Most of the sailors were afraid to taste them, but dad and another man ate them.  They were hungry enough to take chances.  Many times they picked worms out of the their bread. He used to think the sailor of today had it pretty soft.<br>
     Once he fell thru a hatch and was knocked out.  When he remembered what had happened he was up in the mast painting.<br>
     He came to Seattle on a sailing vessel when there was only on brick building there and stayed for several months.  But in the meantime his folks had come to Chicago, and he went back to see them.  I am not sure if they were in Chicago yet or if they had gone to Sioux City, but I know he was with them there.  Because we used to love to have him tell us about a fight he had there.  It seems aunt Sophie, Erica and uncle Oscar were going to school and some children made fun of them and kept throwing rocks.  Uncle John and dad were sawing some wood along the riverbank. (I hope there is a rive in Sioux City, Woodbury, IA.)  Anyhow, there was a sawmill there.  Uncle John told them to quit.  Soon the dad [of the rock throwers] came over to uncle John and stated to call him names, so my dad took it up from thereon and made the old man say 'Uncle.'  A crowd of people gather around and yelled: "Give it to him, you big Swede."  He hadn't been a sailor for two years without learning to fight.<br>
     When they moved to Glenwood my dad carried mail from Vermillion to P.O. there. That was where he met my mother.  She was working in a Hotel there and used to ride with him up to Brooklyn to see uncle John Peterson.<br>
     My mother had worked very hard in Sweden and taken care of herself since she was twelve years old.  She tells of working one year for a pair of shoes and board, worked outside everyday but three.  He father died when she was quire young.  She had a young brother August who came over from Sweden by himself when he was a small boy.  He belonged to the first band organized in South Dakota and went to school in this country.  He was killed at Watertown, SD, about 1898 where a brick building collapsed.  You probably remember him better than I do.<br>

William Andre FALK
<p>
<a name ="I004251"><b>[I004251]</b></a><br />
Married - William Andre Falk, son of Henry E. Falk to Mary Elliott Green, daughter of Roy W. Green. 23 August 1948 -  St. Thomas  Times-Journal, St.Thomas, Ontario<br>
---------------------------------------------<br>
Dr. William Andre "Bill" Falk (July 14, 1924 - April 12, 2015) died suddenly, at home, basically of old age. His body wore out, but not his joie de vivre. He went to bed looking forward to the last round of the Masters, but didn't make it through the night. We hope that he has somehow rejoined his beloved Molly, who went before him in 2013. Bill was the middle child of Henry and Julie Falk of Vancouver, BC. His brother Harry passed too soon, but his sister Mary is still with us. He helped out in his father's pharmacy as a young man, and trained in radar operations for the Navy toward the end of the war. Although he never got overseas, the service helped him acquire his MD in Edmonton in 1949. As an added bonus he found a soulmate to share almost 65 years of marriage. He practiced medicine in Victoria for 25 years, in the days of house calls and midnight callouts to assist with deliveries, many of whom remember him to this day. He was an early proponent of family practice research in Canada, and received the Nuffield Foundation Travelling Fellowship, which took him around the world in 1965. In 1973 he was made an Honorary Fellow of the Royal College of General Practitioners, an award handed to him by Prince Philip himself. In 2010 he received a Lifetime Achievement Award in Family Medicine Research from the College of Family Physicians of Canada, of which he was the chairman of the research committee from 1970 to 1974. When he gave up his medical practice it was to return to school at UBC to earn an M.Sc. in Health Services Planning, which he applied as an associate professor at the University of Calgary for 9 years. When he finally retired, he and Molly built a small house beside a golf course in the Shuswap, where they spent many active years, before relocating to Sidney for the last, gradually less active, 18 years. Bill lives on in his three children Bruce, Andrea and Graham, and all the lives he has touched over the years. The family would like to thank the caregivers at Saan. Pen., Beacon, Mt. Newton and the Jubilee for the care and support provided to both Bill and Molly in their declining years, as they struggled with the inability of their physical systems to keep up with their indomitable spirits. And a special thank you to the team of first responders who tried their best to keep Bill with us a little longer. A memorial service will be held at Holy Trinity Church, 1319 Mills Road in North Saanich, at 11:00 AM on Monday, April 27, followed by a reception at the church hall. In lieu of flowers please send a donation to a charity that will make the world a better, kinder place, to make up for the loss of one of the best and kindest people that's inhabited it so far. Condolences may be offered to the family at www.mccallbros.com<br>
