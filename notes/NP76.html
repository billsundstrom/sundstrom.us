Ruby Eileen CARSON
<p>
<a name ="I085085"><b>[I085085]</b></a><br />
Ruby Eileen Carson Paxton, 73, of Indianapolis, passed away on Saturday, October 12, 2019. She was born on August 9, 1946 in Logansport, IN to the late John William and Sarah (Cook) Carson.<br>
Ruby was a 1965 graduate of Logansport High School and enjoyed taking classes at Butler University. She worked most recently as a clerk with the Indiana Bureau of Motor Vehicles, retiring in 2016. Ruby enjoyed working in customer service, and her customers appreciated her congenial approach to what is typically considered a routine transaction. Ruby had a small but close circle of friends and could always be counted on for warm, thoughtful support no matter what her own circumstances were at the time. Always an intellectual, she enjoyed time for herself, reading (especially her bible) and learning about a variety of subjects, including gemstones, astronomy and history. Ruby enjoyed Indy racing all her life and spent many Mother ºs Days with her son at the Speedway. And her personable nature at the BMV gained her many friends on those racing teams as they came to her for various commercial license issues. Her strength and spirit allowed her to live life as she wanted in her home despite several serious health setbacks in recent years.<br>
Ruby is survived by her son, Seth (Sarah) Paxton; and sister, Ellen Storvick. She is also survived by three neighborhood cats who made it an evening routine to visit her for attention as though they were hers.<br>
She was preceded in death by her parents; and beloved sister, Margaret Carson.<br>
Burial at Washington Park East Cemetery.<br>
