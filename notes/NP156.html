William (Bill) Dwire , 91, passed away peacefully April 11, 2012. <br>
Bill was born May 3, 1920, in Taos, N.M. He grew up in Taos and graduated from the University of New Mexico with a degree in business administration. During World War II he enlisted in the Navy and served as a lieutenant until his discharge in 1946. He continued his service in the reserves for 7 years. After active duty, his work took him east where he eventually settled with his family in the Detroit area. His career with the National Bank of Detroit spanned over 20 years. He retired in 1985 as head of the Mortgage Banking division. Banking was only one aspect of his life, however. Bill loved boats (even building one that was reputedly a little too big to get out of the basement shop!), airplanes, motorcycles and tennis. Retirement didn't slow him down. He continued to play tennis and ride his motorcycle well into his 80s. Longing for a reconnection with the Southwest he loved so well, he eventually moved year-round to Green Valley, Ariz. He rekindled his passion for Big Band and Swing by helping form the Green Valley Stage Band, still performing today. He played with the Green Valley Concert band as well. Bill is survived by Mary Jo Dwire , his beloved wife of 72 years; and two sons, Ron Dwire (Judy) and Jim Dwire (Fran). He has five grandchildren: Shari Chaffin, Gail Seymour, Amy Chaffin, John Dwire and Thomas Dwire , along with six great-grandchildren and two great-great-grandchildren. Bill had many friends and family who loved him dearly. He will be sorely missed. <br>

Lloyd Len EAST
<p>
<a name ="I066947"><b>[I066947]</b></a><br />
Lloyd Len East , age 95, passed away quietly on February 1, 2007, of natural causes. Lloyd was a 16 year resident of Hemet, Calif. Born December 23, 1911, to Cora Porter East , in Los Angeles, Calif., Lloyd was the eldest of six children. Married in 1936 to Helen Foster of Lakeside, Calif., they were married for 51 years and were the parents of three sons. Lloyd is survived by his three sons, Gerald, Ronald and Richard East ; nine of 11 grandchildren; 21 of 24 great-grandchildren; and two great-great-grandchildren; two brothers; and his sister. <br>
Lloyd was descended from a long line of Mormon pioneers and was a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. He served in several positions, including branch president of the then Fallbrook Branch, counselor to the Bishop, Ward Clerk, stake missionary, home teacher and others. Lloyd loved the church and serving in any way he could. He especially loved serving and being in the temples. He was a truly faithful member and loved greatly by the other members of his congregations for his kindness, cheerful and welcoming demeanor, friendly handshakes and always having candy for the children hidden in his suit pocket. <br>
Lloyd grew up moving between Arizona, Utah and California. As a teenager, Lloyd worked to help support his family by working in mines. As a young adult and throughout World War II he worked as a design engineer in the aircraft industry. Lloyd later moved to Fallbrook, Calif., and lived there for 24 years while he and Helen raised chickens to sell the eggs and had avocado groves and also started his own business as a general contractor. <br>
Lloyd built several homes and contracted to build several church buildings for The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (The Mormon Church), including the buildings in Fallbrook, Westminster, Vista and Indio, Calif. Lloyd and Helen lived in Argentina for three years and built three Mormon Chapels and during that time toured much of South America, including Brazil, Argentina, Peru and Chili. <br>
Returning to the States meant a life change for Helen and Lloyd as they moved to Arizona, and became involved in raising several of their grandchildren. Lloyd , Helen and two of their granddaughters moved to Montrose, Colorado, in 1979 to be by their son, Richard, and his family. Lloyd loved living in Colorado, where he could go fishing and RV camping at a moment's decision. He enjoyed being out in nature. <br>
Lloyd also liked to grow a food garden each year, to invent and to improve on and redesign tools and items already invented. He loved his family and tried to be the best person he could be. He was a kind man with a very subtle, poker-face sense of humor. About four years after his wife, Helen, passed away, Lloyd moved to Hemet, where he lived until his passing. He will be missed and yet we are happy that he is once again with his beloved wife and other family and friends and in care of our Heavenly Father <br>
Interment will be at Nuevo Memory Garden in Ramona.<br>

Anna of EAST-ANGLIA
<p>
<a name ="I015316"><b>[I015316]</b></a><br />
Anna (d. 653/654) was a King of East Anglia (c. 635 - 653/654). He was the son of Eni and the nephew of Eni's brother, Raedwald of East Anglia.<br>
<br>
Penda, king of the Mercians, invaded East Anglia around the year 635, defeating and killing king Egric and the former king Sigebert. Anna then became king. A convert to Christianity, Anna was noted for his piety, and he persuaded Cenwealh of Wessex to accept baptism while the latter was in exile in East Anglia (645 - 648), having been driven out of his own kingdom by another of Penda's invasions.<br>
<br>
Penda returned to East Anglia around the year 650 and defeated Anna, forcing him into exile; he also established Mercian rule over the Middle Angles, making his son Peada their king. Anna briefly returned to power in the years that followed, but was again defeated and killed by Penda in a final invasion.<br>
<br>
Five of Anna's daughters each became known for their saintly virtues; one of them, Æthelthryth, is said to have maintained her virginity through two marriages (her second husband was Ecgfrith of Northumbria) and later became the abbess of Ely.<br>
