Steven Robert SHOEMAKER
<p>
<a name ="I069528"><b>[I069528]</b></a><br />
URBANA - The Rev. Dr. Steven Robert Shoemaker, 73, died on Monday (Oct. 10, 2016) at home due to pancreatic cancer.<br>
He is survived by his wonderful wife of 51 years, Nadja; two marvelous children, Daniel and Marla (as well as their spouses, Rachael and Craig); and two fabulous grandchildren, Carter and Grace.<br>
Born and raised in Urbana, he played trombone and basketball at Urbana High School, while also wooing his future wife, Nadja. He then attended Wheaton College, where he participated in pranks, such as padlocking the chapel doors before a service.<br>
After becoming more serious about his studies (and receiving an ultimatum from his wife), he received a Master of Divinity degree and Master of Sacred Theology degree in 1969 from McCormick Theological Seminary in Chicago. In a further pursuit of education, he then earned a Ph.D. in religion from Duke University in 1979.<br>
Steve Shoemaker served as pastor at Pittsboro and Mount Vernon Springs Presbyterian churches in Pittsboro, N.C., as well as campus pastor at North Carolina State University and McKinley Presbyterian Church in Champaign.<br>
He finished his career as director of the University YMCA at the University of Illinois. For many years, Steve also taught one course a semester in religious studies at either Parkland College or the University of Illinois.<br>
Devoted to his community, Steve served as chair of the Committee for the Homeless, co-chair of the Men's Emergency Shelter Steering Committee, member of the Dr. Martin Luther King Committee, member of the Muslim Committee and served on the Champaign County Board, the United Way Board and the local ACLU Board. He was also an active Urbana Rotary Club member since 1982 and acted as president in 2013.<br>
With a passion for writing, particularly poetry, Steve was nominated for Illinois Poet Laureate in 2003 and was published in a plethora of journals ranging from Christian Ministry to Judaism.<br>
After his cancer diagnosis, he published his first book titled "A Sin A Week." He also received thousands of Likes for poems posted through social media.<br>
In addition to the printed word, Steve reached out to the community through his weekly radio program, "Keepin' The Faith" on WILL AM 580, which provided interviews and discussions highlighting relevant social topics.<br>
Steve donated his rich bass voice to various choirs and was a member of the Real Fire band. He also donated his time to be an integral part in the lives of others as he joined couples in marriage, performed funerals, and provided counseling and support (while never accepting payment).<br>
However, to this writer, Steven Robert Shoemaker's greatest accomplishment was his role within his family. In 50 years of blissful marriage, he modeled how to sincerely love and respect another. He gave corsages, coached soccer and cooked Cheese Surprise. He took his children out of school to see baseball games and go to museums. And although his children did not always recognize it in the moment (as they were dragged to organ concerts or tours of Frank Lloyd Wright houses), Steve Shoemaker demonstrated how to embrace life (Fly kites! Eat dessert first!) and how to make the world a better place.<br>
Despite a host of shortcomings, including but not limited to leaving used toothpicks around the house and eating other people's chocolate bars, Steve was an accomplished author, compassionate pastor, devoted leader, and loving husband and father. He is greatly missed.<br>
Memorial gifts may be made to the University YMCA, 1001 S. Wright St., Champaign, IL 61820.<br>
A memorial service will be held at 7 p.m. Saturday, Oct. 15, at First Presbyterian Church of Urbana, 602 W. Green St., Urbana.<br>

WILLIAM H. SHOEMAKER, 87, a retired professor of Spanish, Italian and Portuguese, died Saturday at Graduate Hospital in Philadelphia. He lived in Pennswood Village in Newtown.<br>
Mr. Shoemaker, a native of Norristown, attended the George School in Bucks County and received a Ph.D. from Princeton University in 1928. He served as chairman of the romance language department at the University of Kansas from 1938 to 1957 and as chairman of the Spanish, Italian and Portuguese department at the University of Illinois from 1957 to 1967. From 1967 until his retirement in 1980, he was a professor emeritus at the University of Missouri.<br>
"He was an eminent Spanish scholar," said his son, Philip. Mr. Shoemaker spent much time in Spain with Spanish scholars, and he was an authority on Benito Perez Galdos, the most famous Spanish author after Cervantes, his son said. He wrote 15 books on Galdos' work and in 1959, received the Order of Civil Merit, the highest civilian award the Spanish government bestows on foreigners, for expanding Spanish culture.<br>
Mr. Shoemaker was a lifelong member of the Norristown Friends Meeting. He also was a member of the American Association of Teachers of Spanish and Portuguese, the Modern Language Association and the American Association of University Professors.<br>

The Philadelphia Inquirer, 27 March 1989<br>
------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
William Hutchinson Shoemaker was born in Norristown, Pennsylvania, March 21, 1902, and died in Newton, Pennsylvania, March 24, 1989.<br>
During his career of more than fifty years, Professor Shoemaker was associated with four major universities. He received the A. B., A. M., and Ph. D. degrees from Princeton University in 1924, 1928, and 1934, respectively, In 1938 he moved from Prince ton to the University of Kansas, Lawrence, where he assumed the Chairmanship of the Department of Romance Languages, a post which he held for nineteen years. From 1957 until 1969 he was Head of the Department of Spanish, Portuguese, and Italian at the University of Illinois, Urbana, and from 1970 to 1980 he was a Visiting Professor of Spanish at the University of Missouri, Columbia.<br>
Professor Shoemaker specialized in late nineteenth- and early twentieth-century Spanish literature and wrote numerous critical articles and eight books about the works of Pérez Galdós. His best known publication in this regard is perhaps his excellent three-volume study The Novelistic Art of Galdós (1980-82).<br>
In recognition of his achievements as a distinguished Hispanist, he was made a member of the Orden del Mérito Civil in 1959 and a Miembro Titular del Instituto de Cultura Hispánica in 1970. He also served as Vice President of the Central States Modern Language Association in 1949 and he was President of the AATSP in 1949-50.<br>
Dr. Bill Shoemaker, as he is affectionately remembered, was a unique individual who had a special gift for imparting to his students his great love of art and literature. Although he was demanding in the classroom, he was, at the same time, a benevolent and caring teacher who took great pride in the accomplishments of his students. He will be missed, but his presence remains with those of us who had the good fortune to study with him and know him as a colleague and friend.<br>

William Hutchinson Shoemaker II<br>
July 8, 1965 - October 18, 2014<br>
San Diego, CA - It is with great sadness that Will's family announces his passing on Saturday, October 18, 2014, from an arterial brain bleed suffered on Sunday, October 12th. Will was born on July 8, 1965 in Chicago, IL to his loving parents Philip and Cicely Shoemaker. He graduated from Lejeune HS in 1983. He was a Navy ROTC scholar at Chapel Hill, graduating in 1991 with a Bachelor's degree in Political Science and History. He was a member of Delta Upsilon. Will served his country in the Navy on a fast frigate based out of San Diego, which he later called home. Always a great cook, Will worked in many restaurants in Raleigh and San Diego. He would often take over your kitchen by saying, "Do you need me to check on anything?" As much as he loved cooking, he loved more his job as an Interventional Radiology Technician at Scripps Mercy and the VA Hospital, La Jolla. To say Will enjoyed music is putting it mildly, and if you were lucky enough to receive a CD he made for you, every song was "the best." Will loved golf, cheered for the Chargers and Padres and any team from UNC. He never met a stranger and everyone was his new best friend.<br>
Will was predeceased by his grandparents William and Catharine Shoemaker, David and Helen Conger, his uncles Ted and Chris, and his aunt Helen. Will is survived by the family he loved so much; his parents, his brother David (Denise) of Greensboro, their children Hannah and Brendan, his sister Catie (George) Marsh of Raleigh, their children Sam and Nate, his aunts Alice Conger and Louise Shoemaker, his many cousins, and his companion of 19 years, Marie Salmon of San Diego and her extended family.<br>
Always a giving person, Will was a Donor at his passing. In lieu of flowers, donations in Will's name to Wounded Warrior Project at woundedwarriorproject.org would be appreciated. Will, May the road rise up to meet you. May the wind be always at your back. May the sun shine warm upon your face. Rest in peace.<br>
Funeral services will be held at White Memorial Presbyterian Church, 1704 Oberlin Rd, Raleigh, NC at 11:00 a.m. on Saturday, November 15, 2014. Burial will be private.<br>

Fanny May SHOOK
<p>
<a name ="I066839"><b>[I066839]</b></a><br />
Fanny May (Shook) Scott, 90, of Ulysses, PA, died Tuesday, September 19, 2017 in Sweden Valley Manor, Coudersport, PA. After 90 years on this earth, Fanny is now in the presence of Jesus Christ, her Lord and Savior and those she loved who had gone home before her, including her beloved husband Ronald "Bud" Monroe Scott, her parents Frances Amelia (Krusen) Shook and Clarence Montimore Shook, and her sister, Charlotte Irene (Shook) Grandits.<br>
Fanny was born in Ulysses on May 7, 1927 in the home of her grandmother, Fannie Barker (Krusen) Johnson. She was raised in Buffalo, NY. After high school, she worked in a bank. While visiting relatives in Ulysses, after WW II was over, she met Bud. They married on her birthday May 7, 1949. They had almost 65 years together, when she lost Bud on March 14, 2014.<br>
She was told by a doctor, early in her marriage, that she would never have children. She is survived by four of them: Rhonda (David) Foertsch, their daughters, Leah (Andrew) Sarge and Mary Frances Foertsch (Tyler Shissler); Laurel (Arthur) Kear, their son, Andrew (Jennifer) Kear and grandson Joshua, their other son, Thomas Kear; Timothy (Linda) Scott, their daughter, Erica (Bret) Matteson and grandsons Holden and Landon, their son, Craig Scott (Kristin Perry), their other son, Brian (Sara) Scott; Ronald (Angela) Scott , their son Brandon (Stephanie) Scott, their daughter, Stephanie (Donald) Clemons and grandchildren, Tori and Bryson; their daughter,  Brittany Freelove and granddaughters, Brooke and Alexis. She is also survived by her brother-in-law, Florian Grandits, her sisters-in-law, Rosalind (Robert) Eastman, and Marion Jean (James) Durandetta, several nieces and nephews, and great nieces and nephews.<br>
She spent her married life raising her children and spoiling her grandchildren and great grandchildren. She worked many part and full-time jobs to help support her family. She retired as a "cafeteria lady" for the Northern Potter School System in 1989. She was also known as an excellent cook and baker. Often, you could smell the cookies, homemade bread, or cinnamon rolls as you came home from wherever you were coming from.<br>
Her house was always busy and often full of neighbors, friends, and relatives. She loved to play cards, especially with her best friend, Helen Young, who predeceased her on September 12, 2015. She had a great sense of humor and the ability to laugh at herself. Many of you know a "Fanny" story or two.<br>
She was a member of Mills Union Church in Mills, PA, and an auxiliary member of the Carl E. Hyde Legion Post #963.  She also served many years volunteering at Charles Cole Memorial Hospital as a "pink lady" with her friend, Helen. She also was active in two card clubs.<br>
She considered her family as her greatest blessing. In spite of lifeʼs ups and downs, she kept us strongly bonded as a family. She would give the shirt off her back if someone needed it more than she did. She was loved by many and will be deeply missed by her family and friends.<br>

Judith Emily SHOPE
<p>
<a name ="I107499"><b>[I107499]</b></a><br />
Long-time Great Falls resident Judith S. Stevens died at Benefis Hospital on Dec. 19th, 2017.  She was 83 years old.<br>
A fourth-generation Montanan, Judith Emily Shope was born in Missoula, Montana on January 30th, 1934. She was named after the Judith River and her pioneer, North Carolina-born grandmother,  Emily A. Stinson.<br>
She spent most of her formative years in Helena, Montana. Her parents were western artist, Irvin "Shorty" Shope and homemaker, educator, Erva Love Shope. The oldest of four red-headed Shope kids, Judith grew up surrounded by traditional art, western history and Indian lore. The family was known for having a teepee in their backyard and riding their horses in the foothills around the state capitol.<br>
Judith attended Helena schools. She graduated from high school in 1952.<br>
During an orientation event at MSC (now MSU Bozeman,) she met her future husband, Richard Stevens.<br>
In the Fall of 1955, Judith and Richard were married at St. Peterʼs Cathedral (Episcopal) in Helena.<br>
She completed her education in 1956 at MSC and received a bachelorʼs degree in home economics with a minor in art. Later Judith would eventually earn a masterʼs degree.<br>
In the coming years, Judith and Richard were blessed with three children: David, Rachel and Mary Alice. The family resided in Kalispell, Billings and finally settling in Great Falls.<br>
While Richard pursued a career in architecture, Judith concentrated on being a mother and homemaker. Once Mary Alice, her youngest child, was old enough to attend school, Judith began her vocation as an educator. For most of her career she taught home economics in middle and high school. On occasion she would teach a class in art--- usually drawing.<br>
Judith was a dedicated teacher and loved interacting with her students. Many of her students remember her for their introduction to sewing; a few of them still wear the projects they completed in her class. During her career she was an instructor at Paris Gibson Junior High, West Junior High, North Junior High, and at the time of her retirement she was a faculty member of Great Falls High School.<br>
An enthusiatic proponent of the arts, she encouraged her children to pursue  creative interests--- whether it was in music or visual arts. A globalist in outlook, Judith embraced the interconnectedness of two-dimensional art, pottery and soft sculpture.<br>
A life-long Episcopalian, she attended St. Lukes, Billings; Christ Church, Kalispell and for the last 50 years Church of the Incarnation in Great Falls. Judith served on the vestry, altar guild and was a member of Daughters of the King. She also taught Sunday school.<br>
While not being an avid outdoor enthusiast, Judith enjoyed and honored the natural world. She attended many sessions at Camp Marshall, the rustic Episcopal Church Camp on Flathead Lake. She liked sketching outdoors and picking huckleberries. Later on in life she enjoyed watching sleeping mule deer in her backyard and was particularly fond of a cottontail rabbit who lived  under Richardʼs aging two-door Porsche.<br>
In April of 2001 Judith suffered a heart-breaking loss. Her youngest child, Mary Alice died of complications of lupus. Having been dogged by melancholy all of her life, it was a major set back for her.<br>
She endured other challenges. In the Fall of 2014 Judith suffered a stroke. It effected her speech, vision and some of her mobility. She was institutionalized.  After being told she would never be able to return to her residence; stubbornly, Judith started walking, again. Ten months later, she wheeled herself out of the assisted living center and never looked back. Judith lived the last few years of her life, with some limitations, on her own terms at her own house.<br>
She is predeceased by her husband, Richard (who passed away in 2016,) her daughter, Mary Alice Stevens; her daughter-in-law, Annette Trinity-Stevens and her two sisters: Joyce Shope Johnson and Jane Shope Hyatt.<br>
Judith is survived by her brother, Richard H. Rhydes; son, David Rutledge Stevens and his children Derek and Emily, her daughter Rachel Stevens Hawkins and Rachelʼs children Alysa and Porter. Being from pioneer lineage, she is also survived by many nieces, nephews, in-laws and first, second and third cousins.<br>
A believer in ever-lasting life and the power of the Trinity, Judith rests on a spiritual shore somewhere. She has secured a spot on a battered, moss-covered rock. Clutched in her hand is a canvas bag containing a dozen paperbacks carefully bookmarked with balsa-like driftwood. She is looking to the West. In the distance is Angel Point. Curling down from Somers, the wind is on time. Always on time. Judith is waiting; waiting for the mast of Richardʼs sailboat to break the horizon. Through the power of the Holy Spirit they will soon be reunited for eternity.<br>
The funeral will be held at Incarnation Episcopal Church, 600 Third Ave. North, Great Falls, MT at 10:30 a.m. on Monday, January 8th, 2017. The Rev. Timothy Ljunggren officiating.<br>
