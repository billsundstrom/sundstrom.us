Nigel of CHESTER
<p>
<a name ="I007431"><b>[I007431]</b></a><br />
In Norman Cheshire, the first Earl of Chester, Hugh d'Avranches split his estate into baronies. The Halton barony held precedent over all others and Nigel, the constable of Chester (Cheshire) became its first baron. Nigel erected a motte and bailey castle on Halton Hill around 1071 to keep watch over the Lancashire and Cheshire plains and the river estuary. The stone structured castle, as is seen remained today, would have started development in the later half of the 12th century; being gradually built upon, with each of the early barons undertaking various projects and adding to the work of his predecessor.<br>
<br>
In 1115, Nigel's son, William Fitznigel, founded an Augustinian Priory at Runcorn. In 1134 the monks moved the priory to Norton, about three and a half miles away. The barons of Halton provided Norton Priory with substantial amounts of money until 1200. In 1391 the priory was raised to the higher status of abbey. In 1536 the monastery was dissolved, and a few years later the buildings and some of the monastic lands were sold to Sir Richard Brooke who converted the habitable part of the Abbey into a home for himself and his family.<br>

He served on a submarine chaser in the Atlantic and on a support landing craft in the Pacific before returning to Cleveland. <br>
Chidlaw , formerly of Lyndhurst, was a member of Lyndhurst Presbyterian Church. <br>
His first wife died in 1985. Chidlaw and his second wife, the former Patricia Cathcart, were married for 10 years before her death in 1997. <br>
In November 1998, he married the former Ann deHamel Horsey, whose daughter, the former Corinne deHamel, is married to his second wife's son, Robert Cathcart. The Cathcarts live in Chagrin Falls. <br>
Besides his wife, son, stepson and stepdaughter, Chidlaw is survived by stepdaughters, Ellen S. Trezevant of Brussels, Belgium, Laura L. Dodge of Newport Beach, Calif., and JoAnne deHamel-Small of Chagrin Falls; five grandchildren; three step-grandchildren; two great-grandchildren; and two sisters.
