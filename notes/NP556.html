A memorial service will be held tomorrow for J.R. ''Ray'' Utterstrom , a retired Boeing Aerospace Co. vice president whose career included work on commercial aircraft, bombers and missiles. He died Monday at his Bellevue home at age 64.<br>
Mr. Utterstrom , who retired in July, was born in Vancouver, B.C., but spent most of his childhood in Seattle's Ballard neighborhood. In 1948, he graduated from the University of Washington with a degree in electrical engineering.<br>
Soon after graduation, he joined Boeing and began an association with a long list of Boeing products such as the 707, 727, 737 and 747 commercial aircraft, the B-47 and B-52 bombers and the KC-97 and KC-135 aerial refueling tankers.<br>
One of his early engineering achievements, while serving as electrodynamics chief for the 707, was development of the first automatic landing system certified for commercial use. Later, he directed control dynamics research on the Supersonic Transport.<br>
After serving as chief technology engineer and director of engineering for commercial aircraft programs, Mr. Utterstrom became program manager for the Subsonic Cruise Armed Decoy system, a program that became the Air Launched Cruise Missile (ALCM) system.<br>
The last ALCM, No. 1,715, was delivered to the Air Force's Strategic Air Command Oct. 7 in a ceremony at the factory, which Mr. Utterstrom attended.<br>
Mr. Utterstrom headed the ALCM project until four years ago, when he was named manager of the missile systems division. He became a vice president in 1980.<br>
In 1985, Mr. Utterstrom was presented the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics' Wright Memorial Lectureship for leadership in development of the ALCM. The year before, he won the AIAA's Ed Wells Award for excellence in technical management.<br>

John Russell UVAAS
<p>
<a name ="I044155"><b>[I044155]</b></a><br />
On Tuesday afternoon December 27, 2011, Big John Uvaas passed away unexpectedly doing what he loved, cutting wood on his farm to work up an appetite for the next holiday meal. <br>
He was born at home on the Uvaas Farm in the Town of Winchester, June 22, 1929. His parents were Albert and Selma (Anunson) Uvaas. He attended Grandview Grade School and Winneconne High School graduating with the class of 1947. After high school, John enlisted in the U.S. Army where he earned a rank of Staff Sergeant in the 82nd Airborne. In 1949 he was selected to be on the elite 12 man honor guard for the inauguration of Harry Truman. John also was a standout tackle on his Army's football team. He had college offers to continue his gridiron pursuits, but nothing could keep him away from his sweetheart, Betty Metzig. He returned to Winchester and married Betty on April 5, 1952. They purchased the farm from Betty's parents (Erwin and Myrtle Metzig) and made this their home ever since. <br>
He and Betty built up a successful dairy operation and in 1963 started John Uvaas Livestock Trucking, which continued until his "retirement" in 1999, at age 70. <br>
John's years were filled with many stories of achievement and service to others. He was a long time member and past chief of the Winchester-Clayton Fire Department. John was a lifelong member of Grace Lutheran Church, currently serving as president of the church council. He never hesitated to step forward when there was a call for volunteers for anything.<br>
John was a steward of the earth and respected every blessing God granted. He nurtured the land, planted thousands of trees, cared for his pond, and always advised "you should leave it better than you found it."<br>
Undoubtedly his most cherished endeavors were his family, his faith, and his countless friends. He liked to talk. He enjoyed a good laugh. He loved to love. <br>
John is survived by his wife, Betty; three siblings, Audrey Mueller, Shirley and Mike Skopick, David Uvaas; his children, John and Lori Uvaas, Pete and Cindy Uvaas, Fay and Dennis Scheurer, Amy and Wade Clarke; his grandchildren, Adam Uvaas, Ben and Lindsey Uvaas, Jake Uvaas, Zach and Kristin Uvaas, Molly Uvaas, Leah, Leslie, and Lindsey Scheurer; Addie and Katie Clarke; his great-grandchildren: Talan, Landon, and Zoe. <br>
He was preceded in death by his parents, and his youngest daughter, Mary Jo<br>
A Memorial Service will be held on Saturday, December 31, 2011, at 11:00 a.m. at Grace Lutheran Church of Winchester, Larsen, Wisconsin, with Pastor Dan Luett officiating. Inurnment with military honors will follow in the Grace Lutheran Cemetery, Winchester. A Visitation for family and friends will be on Friday, December 30, from 4:00 to 8:00 p.m. at Mueller Funeral Home, Winneconne, and will continue on Saturday at the church from 9:30 a.m. until the time of the service.<br>

We love you and miss you Dad! I Love you Johnny Boy!<br>

Cyril Stanley VAIL
<p>
<a name ="I116312"><b>[I116312]</b></a><br />
It is with great sadness that the family of Cyril Stanley Vail announce his passing, which occurred on Wednesday, November 10, 2021, at the Sussex Health Centre, Sussex, NB. Born in Saint John, NB, on February 3, 1942, he was a son of the late Cecil and Ruth (Follett) Vail.<br>
Cyril lived his whole life in Belleisle Creek, NB. He carried on the family farm, owned since 1907 after his father passed away in 1980. It became a cow-calf operation which he managed successfully until ill health forced him to sell the cattle. Cyril farmed in conjunction with working the woodlot. He was also involved with SNB Wood CO-OP, NB Soil and Crop, NB Cattle Producers and the NB Federation of Wood lot Owners. The "woods" was his happy place and he loved going there. He continued going to the woods this past winter, operating the log loader while the boys cut. His hobby was work and to him, work was fun.<br>
Cyril is survived by his loving wife Linda (Ness) Vail of Belleisle Creek, NB; children: Patricia Vail (Amanda) of Saint John, NB, Timothy Vail of Belleisle Creek, NB and Nicholas Vail (Stacy) of Belleisle Creek, NB; grandchildren: Emily, Brandon and Cameron Vail and their mother Crista; grandchildren: Hannah and Ayden Vail; brother Laurence Vail; sisters: Shirley Devoe (Glenn), Judy Hughes (David), Barbara Sprague (Allen) and Pam Hughes; as well as many nieces and nephews. In addition to his parents, Cyril was predeceased by his brother Earle Vail (Carol); and brother-in-law Dwight Hughes.<br>
</p>
Laurence Cecil VAIL
<p>
<a name ="I116310"><b>[I116310]</b></a><br />
It is with great sadness that the family of Laurence Cecil Vail announce his passing, which occurred on Monday, December 6, 2021, at the Kiwanis Nursing Home, Sussex, NB. Born in Belleisle Creek, NB, on September 28, 1936, he was a son of the late Cecil and Ruth (Follett) Vail.<br>
Laurenceʼs first job was for his uncle Clarence Vail ʻUnkʼ when he was 12 years old, in later years he went to the same farm to visit with cousins Les and Garf and friend Percy. On Sunday nights Laurence, Garf and Percy were together in the shed by the road listening to ʻCountry Jamboreeʼ and waving to cars as they drove by.<br>
In his late teens he went to Ontario two different years in late summer with the ʻPrice boysʼ (Ronald and Clarence) to pick tobacco, a back breaking job but good money! Then he went to work with Gerald Northrup (G.E. Northrup Ltd) cutting pulp and driving a pulp truck and running a bulldozer, he never went back picking tobacco because Gerald made it worth his while to stay. He was certified to do agricultural land clearing and did this work while working for G.E. Northrup. Laurencesʼ brother Cyril also worked with Gerald and on one day they hand loaded onto a pulp truck in excess of 110 cords of pulpwood from the Hatfield Point pulp yard and took it to the wharf at Hatfield Point and dumped it into the Irving Woodlands boom. Laurence was a hard worker and loved working, he was also very neat when it came to his woodpile or snow shovelling. There wasnʼt a wood pile in Belleisle Creek as neat as his...partly because when he was cutting his own firewood and he made sure he cut every stick the same length so the pile was neat on both sides! His last job was with T.A. Raymond running heavy equipment.<br>
Before he went to the Kiwanis Nursing Home he had a cat which he called ʻkitty catʼ which followed him everywhere he went on his property. This cat was pretty special to him and during the winter after a snowstorm it had itsʼ own neatly shovelled path. He loved candy and while in the nursing home he always had a shirt pocket full of hard candy and some to share with the workers there. Sussex Golden Ginger Ale was his favourite soft drink...had to be Sussex. And he loved black licorice pipes and it better not be a black licorice cigar because they didnʼt taste the same according to him! His best buddy was Greg Gallagher who was living at the Kiwanis when Laurence moved in there they were together all the time visiting, watching TV and hanging out. According to Greg long before they were residents of Kiwanis Greg was the local barber where Laurence had his hair cut for over 40 years.<br>
Several of the staff at Kiwanis told family members he was a favourite with them which warmed our hearts. The family wishes to thank the nurses and other staff for the excellent care given to Laurence during his 3  years as a resident at the home.<br>
Laurence is survived by his children: Betty Lou Smith (Bill), Bev Desruisseau (Rick) and Lorraine Huggard all of Belleisle Creek, NB, Marilyn Hovey (John) of Waterborough, NB, Kevin Vail of Moncton, NB, Karen Walsh (Fred) of Sussex, NB, Russell Vail (Kathy) of Barrie, ON, Kimberly Vail (Shaun McKeown) of Grand Bay, NB, Rick Vail (Marcia Bunnel) of Apohaqui, NB and Tony Vail of Belleisle Creek, NB; mother of his children, Alice (Price) Vail; sisters: Shirley Devoe (Glenn) of Houlton, ME, Judy Hughes (David) of Sussex, NB, Barb Sprague (Allen) and Pam Hughes both of Quispamsis, NB; sister-in-law Linda Vail; long time friend, Greg Gallagher; grandchildren: Shyann McQueen (Dave Betts), Matthew Smith (MacKenzie), Melissa Roy (Chris), Craig Smith, Ben Desruisseau (Jennifer), Crystal Desruisseau (Kyle Kitch), Derick Huggard (Christine), Brittney Munn (Josh), Rebecca Stevens (Justus), Alex Hovey, Fred Walsh (Stephanie), Kayla Walsh (Caleb Reicker), Marshall Vail (Kyla), Blake Vail (Celeste), Mitchell Vail (Mackenzie Alward), Wyatt Vail, Wyatt McKeown, Bree Vail, Zayne Vail; great grandchildren: Gwenyth Mitchell Smith, Gabrielle Smith, Sawyer Roy, Camille Roy, Madison Desruisseau, Lexie Desruisseau, Jordan Desruisseau, Cade Huggard, Charlotte Huggard, Lillian Huggard, Camden Munn, Bennett Stevens, Harlee Reicker, Aubree Reicker, Roy Reicker, Desmond Vail, Vivian Vail, Blakelyn Vail, Nolan Vail; one great great grandchild, Kayden Desruisseau; as well as manny nieces and nephews. In addition to his parents, Laurence was predeceased by his son Ronnie Vail; son-in-law Billy Huggard; brothers: Earle (Carole) and Cyril Vail; grandson Charles Smith; and brothers-in-law Walter Golding and Dwight Hughes.<br>
