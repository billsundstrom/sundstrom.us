Captain J. H. Simonds died in Greenfield, Mass., last Friday, 18th, and his remains were brought to Windsor on Tuesday for interment in the new cemetery. He was the well known proprietor of the Windsor House in this place, of which he had the management for nearly forty years, previous to 1882, when Captain R. J. Coffey became landlord. Before engaging in the hotel business he was one of the most famous stage drivers in this section of the Connecticut valley. For the past few years he had been in feeble health, and his death must be attributed to the general breaking down of the system attendant upon old age. <br>
