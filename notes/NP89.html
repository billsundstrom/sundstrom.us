Stanley Clarke - A Legend<br>
Stan was born in Fort William, Ontario and had moved out to Lethbridge from after many years as a radio operator in the Ontario bush. His radio communications had guided and landed many bush planes and commercial ventures during this time. He was hired by Trans Canada Airlines which later turned into Air Canada. Stan was with Air Canada until he retired in 1972.<br>
While he was with Trans Canada Air, he began to paint in oils, and the legacy began . . . Stan Clarke was introduced to the arts in the early 1950's when he met Jean Reagh while moonlighting at a flower shop in Lethbridge Alberta. Jean had attended Alberta College of Art and the Chicago Art Institute. Stan and Jean moved to Vancouver and set up Reagh Studios and sold ceramics and supplies. Stan's contemporaries were Bill Reid, Tony Onely and Gathy Faulk among many others. He exhibited as a portrait painter and a jeweler, working in silver and enamel. <br>
He was in on the start of the BC Potters guild and began to moonlight at the UBC Potter's hut teaching in the extension department while working for Air Canada and as well designing the award winning flight dispatcher's office at the 'new' Vancouver airport. He spent some time with the great potter Bernard Leach in England. <br>
In 1956 the Clarkes moved to Surrey and set up a pottery and sculpture studio, producing work there for many years in the old chicken houses, firing the oil kiln only at night as not to distress the neighbors' with the black clouds! Stan retired from Air Canada and set up Greenbarn Pottery Supply at the farm. During this time Stan attended a World Craft council meeting in Britain and was bitten by the studio glass bug, he learned about blowing glass by studying with George Elliott and also spent time at the Glass House in London. On return to Canada, he set up a hot glass shop in the early '70's and exhibited from then on. <br>
Stan was always generous with his knowledge and many potters and glass blowers benefited from his advice. He could tell you how to set up a kiln, encouraged those to build a kiln themselves rather than buy one and could tell you how to adjust a glaze that wasn't working out. <br>
When his daughter Chris returned from both Alberta College of Art and the Glass Centre in England, she kicked him out of his glass studio, this was when Stan decided to start turning wood. This was a great time for him and he enjoyed the friends in the wood clubs and pleased many with his creations. <br>
Stan retired from Greenbarn at the age of 92, selling up the old farm where he had spent over 50 years. He set up a wood shop in his new home and received the 'Civic Treasure' award from the City of Surrey in 2008. <br>
Stan and Jean had always had lively discussions on Art vs Craft, and it was always entertaining if a roast was cooked in the kiln and forgotten and reduced to ashes, or wine was mulled by a hot poker in the glory hole of the glass studio. Famous people have had their Lincolns danced on by goats and investigated by cats(Uncle Ben and Harry Adaskin). But every one was welcome and entertained by the antics of the various animals that populated the farm. <br>
Stan Clarke was a renaissance man of our times, curious, hungry for knowledge and a great fan of musical theatre. He had a great circle of friends and was much loved by Bacon and Van, Bull Terriers that he loved dearly, and they loved him. Bacon was at the Bridge to meet him and sadly for Chris, Van followed Stan a few days later, onto this new chapter. <br>

John C. CLARYS
<p>
<a name ="I043283"><b>[I043283]</b></a><br />
John C. Clarys, 62, passed away on Wednesday, July 15, 2020 at his home in Center, ND, after a two-year battle with brain cancer.<br>
Born to John J. and Catherine (Vogel) Clarys, John grew up in the Menoken/McKenzie area east of Bismarck. John attended elementary schools in McKenzie and Menoken and graduated from St Maryʼs High School in Bismarck.<br>
John married Deb Boone in 1980. They moved to Carson where John built their first home and where they raised their two boys, Jacob and Caleb.<br>
John started his career in carpentry as a part time job while in high school. Over the years, he built and remodeled many houses, apartment buildings and pole barns. He enjoyed working alongside fellow craftsmen such as his brother Dick Clarys, and good friends Marshall Feland, Brian Wingenbach, Dick Kraft, Claude Ulrich, and Dick Woodbury. Through the 1980ʼs, John managed Marshall Lumber and then Stur-D Products until 2012, while still doing carpentry jobs on the side. John and Deb owned and managed the Carson Manor for 25 years. Johnʼs incredible talent and skills served him well, especially while maintaining the ten apartments occupied by various senior citizens of Carson, each of which became cherished surrogate grandparents to both John and Deb. The Carson years were full, busy, and flew by too quickly; only to be replaced by a 2013 career move to Center, ND where John once again picked up his tool belt and launched Trinity Carpentry.<br>
John was an active member of St. Theresaʼs Catholic Church in Carson, teaching 2nd grade CCD, and doing much of the church restoration there. His move to Center kept him teaching 2nd grade (First Communion) CCD at St Martinʼs Catholic Church. John tallied 22 years as a 2nd grade CCD teacher thanks to a first ask from Fr. Ken Phillips.<br>
Johnʼs happy place was his cabin at Lake Tschida, another ongoing remodel project and the family get-away near Heart Butte Dam. Johnʼs list of projects was never ending, but he always found time for fishing and being out on the water with family and friends.<br>
A special thanks goes out to loving caregivers; Maria Tellez, Judy Walters, Heather (Clarys) Gappert, Natalee Gappert, and many family and friends.<br>
Blessed to share his life was his wife of 40 years, Deb; two sons, Jacob and Caleb; siblings, Richard and Vicki Clarys, Reva Clarys and Gary McFadden, William and Linda Clarys, Robert Clarys, and Dennis Clarys; Debʼs parents, Roger and Claudia Boone; siblings, David and Tabitha Boone, Andrea and Dan Schmitz, and Terry and Tammy Boone; and many nieces and nephews.<br>
