When her grandparents, C.F. and Louisa Miller, moved to Florida in 1910, they left her a small table that she cherished.  The table belonged to Louisa's Grandmother, Mrs. H. Wright and was in the Wright home in Roberts Meadows, MA, about 1800.  Gertrude's sister Lillian had it in her home near Andrews Nursery, Faribault after marriage.  Gertrude does not recall how she came into possession of it, but it remained with her as a bedside table until she passed it on to her brother Lester's family for retention as a Miller family Heirloom circa 1986.  As of 1986 the table is in the home of Lester and Dorothy's daughter Madge Fratzke in Hutchinson, MN.<br>

"While the community of Hatfield was being established on the west bank of the river, the land further west was left to the animals and the Indians.  Alone, that is, until about the year 1735 when a noted hunter and trapper, John Miller of Northampton, erected a log house on a hill in the eastern portion of the 'Hatfield Woods.'  He purchased a tract of 900 acres, bounded on the south by the Northampton line and embracing what later became a thriving village.<br>
<br>
          For seventeen years Mr. Miller hunted and trapped in solitary splendor.  Game was plentiful, with deer, bear, wolves, catamounts, wild turkey, and smaller animals to be had, and the streams were filled with trout.  Indians there were , too, but obviously Mr. Miller was successful in evading their raids.  Then Capt. Samuel Fairfield settled close by and ended Mr. Miller's solitary domination, but this probably was not too onerous since Captain Fairfield was his nephew.  Between 1745 and 1750 a stage road was opened across the region between Northampton and Pittsfield and Captain Fairfield opened a tavern to accommodate travelers over the route.<br>
<br>
          Further settlement awaited the ending of the French and Indian Wars, when men felt reasonably safe in leaving the protected settlements.  From 1760 to 1771 many homesteads were established on the numerous hills.  Indian raids occurred occasionally, as various wandering bands sought to discourage white men from further expansion. "<br>
