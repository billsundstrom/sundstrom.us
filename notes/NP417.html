Sean Alexander PASTRAMA
<p>
<a name ="I051533"><b>[I051533]</b></a><br />
Sean Alexander Pastrama died on his twenty-third birthday, December 9, 2007. <br>
He was diagnosed with a brain tumor May of 2006, and had surgery at City of Hope in Duarte, California where a doctor there was able to remove 30% of his tumor which was located at the base of his brain near his brain stem. <br>
An MRI taken in October revealed that his tumor had grown back to its original size, and was continuing to grow. Sean became paralyzed on his right side and could no longer hear out of his left ear. <br>
The family raised money to send him to an alternative medical clinic in Mexico where he received treatment by eating only a whole foods organic diet, with absolutely no salt or processed fats. He drank 13 glasses of freshed squeezed juices a day and remained in Mexico for a few weeks. Sean arrived home on Thanksgiving of 2006 on what seemed to be the road to recovery. <br>
For almost an entire year Sean fought his condition, but another MRI revealed that, even though his original tumor had in fact shrunk significantly, it had metasticed in four different places. <br>
Sean was in and out of the hospital during the last few months prior to his death, his heart stopped on Tuesday December 4; medical personal were able to recucitate him but he went into a coma. Sean was pronounced braindead, and the family was told on December 9, his twenty-third birthday, that they had to take him off of life support. <br>
The night Sean died, there were over thirty people in his room to say goodbye to him. The nurse said she had never seen so many people to see one patient in her entire career. <br>
Sean loved life, he was voted class clown his senior year, and he had a laugh that could brighten the heaviest of moods. He was a talented skateboarder and loved to mountain bike and spend hours in the gym working out. He could bench more than 350 pounds. <br>
Sean also loved computers and was going to school for a degree in computer science. He enjoyed philosophy and was also part of a men's Bible study group which he loved very much. <br>
Sean has two brothers who are younger, and three sisters, two older and one younger.<br>
Sean called one of his best friends after he was diagnosed and said to him "When I beat this, when all of this is over, I want to tell my story, I want people to know Jesus the way I know him" <br>
A day or two prior to when Sean went into a coma a friend visited him and asked him a question. he asked "Sean, if you could be anywhere right now, where would it be?" Sean, blind at this point closed his eyes and looked up. It took him a second and he struggled out one word. "Heaven." <br>
Sean's funeral was held one week later at the Redlands Seventh Day Adventist Church in Redlands, CA. The Church was so packed that people were getting chairs from the storage room and sitting in the aisles, along with people all across the back standing. One person who attended quoted the funeral as being "the most beautiful and loving service I''''''''ve ever been to". When we were being escorted to the gravesite, one of the police escorters came to Sean''''''''s father and said "Was this man in the military? I've never seen so many cars in one procession." <br>
Though Sean's time here wasn't as long as the people around him would have liked, it was long enough to have impacted those people with his love for life, for family, friends, and especially for God. <br>

History of the Randall House<br>
Chapter Six<br>
Charles Patriquin, 1927 - 1932<br>
1927 June 27:   W.C.B. Harris conveyed the land to Charles Patriquin, farmer. [Book 146 page 647]<br>
1927 July 28:   The Acadian noted the death of Eardley Randall at the home of Mr. and Mrs. Thomas Sutherland in Lower Wolfville. He and his sister Annie had been living there. He was 70 years old. According to the obituary, "In recent years his health had been failing and some time ago he suffered a shock from which he never recovered."<br>
1931 February 19:   The Acadian noted the death of Miss Annie B. Randall, at the Sutherlands' home. "For a long period Miss Randall, a gentle and beautiful Christian spirit, was confined to the house and much of the time to her bed, seen by but few."<br>
      Charles Patriquin, a descendant of Jean Patriquin, was among the Foreign Protestants who emigrated from Rotterdam and nearby ports to Halifax during May and June, 1752. Many of them were from the city and vicinity of Montbeliard, a semi-autonomous enclave in eastern France, under the jurisdiction of the House of Warttenberg. The Patriquins were part of the migration of Foreign Protestants to the province following the establishment of Halifax. To counter-balance the Acadian Catholics, the British intended to populate the colony with Protestants who owed allegiance to the British Crown.<br>
      James Graham Patriquin was born in Tatamagouche in 1837 and in 1863 married Matilda Pick in Wolfville. They lived on Gaspereau Avenue and had five children - Charles Aubrey, George Harvey, Ella May, Flora Belle, and Grace. James was a harness maker and died in 1882. In 1899 Charles, age 35, fruitgrower, married Sarah N. Craig, 28, daughter of Thomas and Susan Craig.<br>
      In a letter in 1992, Graham wrote:<br>
My parents lived first in a house my father built at the corner of Willow Street and Gaspereau Avenue. For about ten years they lived on Long Island North Grand Pre while Dad operated Evangeline Beach as a resort. They lived in Lower Wolfville from 1910 to 1927 and then in the Randall House from 1927-1947. I spent each summer in Wolfville. Dad died in April, 1947.<br>
We four children grew up on the farm in Lower Wolfville. While my youngest sister, Flora, lived with our parents in the Randall House until her marriage in 1932, the rest of us knew it only as visitors.<br>
My mother had yearned to live in that house for years, while Eardley and Sister Annie were occupants. When it became available, she had her way, with the quiet determination that was one of her characteristics. We children were happy about it; Dad was quickly enthusiastic once he got inside.<br>
      When the Patriquins lived in the house, Charles and Sarah used the room to the rear of the parlour as the dining room. The north east room was used for dining if there were more than four present. In the kitchen, Sarah used a wood-burning stove for cooking and heating. The family was puzzled by the origins of the mortar and whitewash in the north west section of the cellar. The kitchen chamber was for overnight visitors or small children who loved its convenience. The finished and unfinished rooms in the attic were unused. Although the house had running water, the electricity and the bathroom were installed by the Patriquins.<br>
      In her letter of 17 November 1992, Vernita Murphy remembered Charles Patriquin:<br>
I only knew him as a afrmer in Lower Wolfville. After he retired he purchased the Randall House. He kept ducks on the pond. At one time he had two lovely swans which drew a lot of admiration ... I was saddened some years ago on visiting Wolfville to see what a change was made to the beloved pond where the children of Wolfville and adults too spent happy hours. It was truly a favourite spot for all.<br>
      Glen Hancock grew up in Wolfville. He recalls his visits to the house when it was owned by the Patriquins.<br>
When I was a boy, the old house on the corner of Main Street and Victoria Avenue was known as the Patriquin House. All houses in Wolfville were named after the residents. The only manner in which we used the word "Randall" was in respect to the woods up on the hill.<br>
The Patriquins were an old Wolfville family for which the community had great affection. There were one or two pretty girls in the family as I remember, and a boy - Graham - whom I befriended and still maintain contact with him.<br>
C.A. Patriquin was a stocky man with strong hands. He can be remembered pushing a wheelbarrow laden with fresh vegetables to the Wolfville grocery store. He managed a fertile slope of early land leading from the house down almost to the edge of the duck pond. The garden plot has now been sodded over and the duck pond transformed into an artifical pool. This was in Mr. Patriquin's later years, of course, as he had in his early career been a harness maker. But we knew him more for his involvement in the Boy Scout movement. He was an ardent "ornithologer", a man with a great sensitivity for the welfare of wild creatures. Whenever an injured bird was found in the bush it was promptly taken to Mr. Patriquin where a splint was quickly fashioned for a broken wing or leg. There was always a clutter of cages and pens behind the house, containing an assortment of birds, squirrels, and other small animals, recuperating from various injuries.<br>
Not to deny the influence of renowned Robie Tufts on local youth with a bent for the natural sciences, Mr. Patriquin urged more boys into ornithology and biology than anyone else - boys like Earl Godfrey, Sherman Bleakney, Merritt Gibson, Ron Smith and Austin Rand, whose names are known widely.<br>
I had a warm and pleasant relationship with the Patriquins, and many a Sunday supper I enjoyed in their dining room - creamed asparagus in season, prepared by Mrs. Patriquin, a tall rather quiet woman. It always intrigued me when Mr. Patriquin would start up the stairs after supper, saying to Mrs. Patriquin, "Call me in five minutes". And in exactly five minutes she would call him from a refreshing five-minute nap.<br>
The interior of the house does not seem to have been very much changed from those days of the mid-thirties.<br>
Mr. Patriquin was an enthusiastic proponent of the temperance movement, but he had a broadminded attitude toward human frailities. People of my vintage will remember seeing Charlie Patriquin and B.O. Davidson (the publisher of The Acadian and an enemy of the demon rum) taking their constitutionals together, arm in arm, as Mr. Davidson was blind. They were the butt of many local jokes, but in retrospect it was a charming relationship and is now remembered with respect.<br>
Many old Wolfville boys still refer to the museum as the "old Patriquin place", but it has now been given the name of the Randalls who occupied it longer than any other family.<br>
      By the time the Patriquins owned the house there were few women available to work as hired girls. Between 1861 and 1901, approximately 250,000 people emigrated from the Maritime Provinces which had a population of 893,953 in 1901. Many of these were young people who went to New England looking for adventure, an opportunity to earn good wages, and a measure of independence.<br>
      As the labour force was reduced, women who had large families or large households were interested in modern conveniences which could be used for unimaginative and repetitious tasks. These new inventions saved time and labour.<br>
      By introducing electricity into the house, the Patriquins opened the door on the new world of technology. Now, if they chose, they could have an electric sewing machine, an electric vacuum cleaner, or an electric iron.<br>
      Consider that remarkable innovation - the electric iron. Until now, every woman used a flatiron which weighed between three and twelve pounds [about one to five kilograms] and which was heated on top of the wood-burning kitchen stove. Ironing was done close to the hot stove even in the summer. Now, however, an inexpensive electric iron could be purchased which weighed less than three pounds [less than one kilogram], did not require the lighting of a wood stove and gave the woman the summertime option to iron in a cool room.<br>
1932 January 28:   Charles A. Patriquin, farmer, of Wolfville, and Sarah Patriquin conveyed the land to J. Graham Patriquin, teacher, of Wolfville. [Book 157 page 6]<br>

History of the Randall House<br>
Chapter Seven<br>
Graham Patriquin, 1932 - 1947<br>
<br>
1941 August 8:   The citizens of Wolfville were confronted with the proposed removal of the Thomas Andrew Strange DeWolfe house, an historical landmark which stood at the north-east corner of Main Street and gaspereau Extension. As a direct result of this proposal, the Wolfville Historical Society was organized. One of the organizers of the society was Rosamund DeWolfe Archibald, whose mother was a descendant of the original owner. The Society agreed to pay the Wolfville Fruit Company $20.80 a month to rent the house.<br>
<br>
1942 November 4:   The DeWolfe house was opened as a tourists home and tea room. Mrs. R.S. Starr was curator and chatelaine of Wolfville's museum from 1942 to 1962.<br>
<br>
1946:   The Wolfville Fruit Company claimed for tax purposes the property on which the DeWolfe house stood. While the house could have been moved to another site, the cost was prohibitive.<br>
      Charles A. Patriquin died 25 April 1947. His estate was divided among his children Graham Patriquin, Francis Lohnes, and Flora Gordon.<br>
      On 18 July 1947 Graham Patriquin agreed to sell the Randall house and land for $7000. It was reported that the house needed a new roof, extra rafters, new steps and floor for the front porch, two coats of paint on the exterior, repairs to baseboards and cellar windows, and painting of rooms and repairing ceilings. The garden plot was to be ploughed and put into lawn. His Majesty the King in right of Nova Scotia was the lessor and the WHS was the Lessee. "The rental fee will be $1 per annum payable the second day of each year for twenty years, beginning January 1948, to the Deputy Provincial Treasurer, the last payment in 1967." The Lessee could acquire the property after twenty years or could renew the rental agreement.<br>
