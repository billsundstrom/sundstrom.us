Henry LE BOTELER
<p>
<a name ="I095391"><b>[I095391]</b></a><br />
Henry was the son of William le Boteler and Dionysia de Lostock.<br>
His name appears in records from 1261 until his death in 1297. In 1297, he was called to parliament as Henry le Boteler, and returned knight of the shire of Lancashire. When parliament is called the next year, his name does not appear. Also in the same year, Richard le Boteler of Merton granted lands to Henry's widow, "d√±a Isabella quondam uxor Henrici le Boteler." Isabella, Henry's wife was the daughter of the first Richard le Boteler of Merton, and therefore a first cousin once removed to her husband Henry.<br>
Children of Henry and Isabella le Boteler were:<br>
William le Boteler, eldest son, and heir of his grandfather to the barony of Warrington.<br>
Norman, referred to in the Walley Coucher Book, on page 425<br>
A daughter, who married Richard Radclyffe. <br>
Sir John le Boteler<br>
</p>
Isabella LE BOTELER
<p>
<a name ="I095392"><b>[I095392]</b></a><br />
Isabella, the wife and widow of Henry le Boteler, was the daughter of the first Richard le Boteler of Merton, and the first cousin once removed to her husband. <br>
Isabel in 1294 complained that she had been seized at Marton and imprisoned and that her corn there had been reaped, but William le Boteler of Warrington stated in reply that she had sold him the growing corn for 6 marks <br>
On Sunday October 31, 1305, she ordered John de Steynol, her tenant to pay vii out of his rent of her lands in Great Merton to father Humphrey, one of the monks of Whalley, and if he made default he was to forfeit it to Norman le Boteler. She is again mentioned in 1311 in one of the Legh Deeds, and again mentioned in 1328 when she made lease to Richard le Boteler of lands in Merton and Warbreke.<br>
</p>
John LE BOTELER
<p>
<a name ="I095172"><b>[I095172]</b></a><br />
Sir John le Boteler was born about 1328. He inherited his family estates when his father died in 1380. He was at least 52 years old at the time. His father had wisely granted him the manor of Warrington with the church, and the manors of Bewsey, Sankey, Penketh, Burtonwood and Laton before his death.<br>
In 1367, Sir John le Boteler took part in the rebuilding of a bridge over the Mersey at Warrington. This bridge was finished in 1369. At that time, another John le Boteler, one of Warrington's hermit friars, received a license to celebrate divine offices in the chapel at its foot for two years.<br>
Sir John was elected a knight of the shire for Lancashire in parliament that meet on April 4, 1366 (40 Edward III). In 1371, Sir John le Boteler was with John de Gaunt, duke of Lancaster in an expedition into Gascony. He returned home that year, and on November 12, 1371 he was appointed to the office of High Sheriff of Lancashire. His predecessor in the office was Richard fitz John de Radcliffe, who had orders to deliver all the prisoners into his custody, and all the writs, rolls and records relating to his office. He was again appointed to this office for the following year <br>
In 1385, Sir John le Boteler, Thomas de Southworth and Richard de Mascy, with letters of protection in hand, accompanied Ferdinand, master of the military order of St. James of Portugal to Castile. By 1386, Sir John is back at England as one of the king's commissioners to take evidence on the part of Grosvenor in the great trial of Scope and Grosvenor. Sir John had attended parliament in the years 1366, 1372, 1376-1378, 1380, and as knight of the shire in 1388, 1397-1398. Sir John had also served England often abroad as well as at home.<br>
Sir John married Alicia, the daughter of Sir William Plumpton and widow of Richard son and heir of Sir John Sherburn, knight, whom Alicia married in 1351, and became a widow in 1363. Alicia was also a descendant of the de Vilars by way of her grandmother Margaret. As his father had done before him, Sir John had made sure to transfer his estates to his sons before he died at the age of seventy -one.<br>
The children of Sir John and Dame Alicia were:<br>
William, eldest son and heir who succeeded Sir John to the barony of Warrington<br>
John, who became usher of the chamber to Henry V and was at Agincourt<br>
Margaret, who is mentioned in the award on the Legh title as having given a collateral warranty to part of the Boteler estates. This also says that she married an Ardern. <br>
Alice, married to John Gerard, the son of Thomas Gerard. They had a son Peter, and two daughters, Ellen and Elizabeth. She survived her husband and died about 27 Feb 1442 Her brother, John, mentions her daughters as well in his will.<br>

William LE BOTELER
<p>
<a name ="I095424"><b>[I095424]</b></a><br />
William was the son of Almeric le Boteler and Alicia Gernet.<br>
He was under age at the time of his father's death. He was under the wardship of William, earl of Ferrars. The earl paid a good sun of 100¬£ for this wardship and the marriage of his daughter to Sir William. This was a huge sum, which shows that the estates of the young heir were quite large. The record of this fine reads "The king the sheriff of Lincolnshire. Know ye, that for a fine of 100¬£, which earl William de Ferrars hath paid us to have the wardship of the lands and heir of Almeric le Boteler until their full age, with their marriage, we command you to give the said earl seisin of all the lands of the said Almeric in your bailiwick." <br>
In 1254 (38 Henry III), William was attached to answer Roger de Heyton in a plea of trespass for breaking his close, and entering the said Roger's turbary in Brun in Lancashire, and there throwing into a pit the turves which Roger had cut and gathered, and also ill-treating his men. In 1255, William obtained the king's charter to hold a three day fair yearly at his manor of Warrington, on the eve, the day and the morrow of the translation of St. Thomas the martyr. <br>
William became a knight in 1256, at which time he called himself the baron of Warrington. William built a new house which was named Bewsey or Beausey which means fair seat. When Sir William became the sheriff of Lancashire in 1256 he is called Willielmus Pincerna de Bewsey, which is the first mention on the name Bewsey. Later, 6 Feb 1259, King Henry III bestowed the honor of the governor and caste of Lancaster, but also the honor of the high sheriff of the county. <br>
Sir William le Boteler had served the king in his campaing against the Welsh in 10-11 Edward I or 1282-1283. An account of the campaign has the entry of payment, and William is mentioned with "To Master William le boteler for the wages of one constable, two-hundred-and-and-six archers, with ten captains of twenties, from Saturday 16 Jan 1283 to Wednesday the 27th of the same month for twelves days 22¬£ 4s.<br>

He was summoned again on 3 Jun 1291 to appear at Norham, this time to perform military service against the Scots. William was again summoned to parliment on 24 Feb 1297 to be held at Salisbury, and again on 6 Feb 1299. <br>
William le Boteler married Dionysia, the daughter of Henry and Joanna de Lostock. He outlived his wife, and after her death, in her memory, he bestowed a large gift of twenty acres of land in Laton, to pray for the repose of her soul. William died in 1303. Their children were:<br>
Henry le Boteler, who died in his father's lifetime.<br>

</p>
Hugh LE DESPENCER
<p>
<a name ="I005288"><b>[I005288]</b></a><br />
From Wikipedia<br>
<br>
Hugh (1286 - November 26, 1326) was sometimes referred to as "the younger Despenser". He was the son and heir of Hugh le Despenser, Earl of Winchester, by Isabel Beauchamp, daughter of William de Beauchamp, 9th Earl of Warwick.<br>
<br>
He was knight of Hanley Castle, Worcestershire, King's Chamberlain, Constable of Odiham Castle, Keeper of the castle and town of Dryslwyn, and Cantref Mawr, Carmarthenshire, Keeper of the castle and town of Portchester, Keeper of the castle, town and barton of Bristol. He was also Keeper of the castles, manor, and lands of Brecknock, Hay, cantref Selyf, etc., co. Brecon, and Huntington, Herefordshire.<br>
<br>
In May 1306 Hugh was knighted, and that summer he married Eleanor de Clare, a granddaughter of King Edward I of England. Her grandfather owed Hugh's father vast sums of money, and the marriage was intended as a payment of these debts. When Eleanor's brother was killed at the Battle of Bannockburn, she unexpectedly became one of the three co-heiresses to the rich Gloucester earldom, and in her right Hugh inherited Glamorgan and other properties. In just a few short years Hugh went from a landless knight to one of the wealthiest magnates in the kingdom.<br>
<br>
Eleanor was also the niece of the new king, Edward II of England, and this connection brought Hugh closer to the English royal court. He joined the baronial opposition to Piers Gaveston, the king's favorite, and Hugh's brother-in-law, as Gaveston was married to Eleanor's sister. Eager for power and wealth, Hugh seized Tonbridge Castle in 1315. The next year he murdered Llywelyn Bren, a Welsh hostage in his custody.<br>
<br>
Hugh Despenser became royal chamberlain in 1318. As a royal courtier, Hugh manoeuvred into the affections of King Edward, displacing the previous favorite, Roger d'Amory. By 1320 his tyranny was running free. Hugh seized the Welsh lands of his wife's inheritance, ignoring the claims of his two brothers-in-law. He forced Alice de Lacy, Countess of Lincoln, to give up her lands, cheated his sister-in-law Elizabeth de Clare out of Gower and Usk, and had Lady Baret's arms and legs broken until she went insane. He also vowed to be revenged on Roger Mortimer because Mortimer's grandfather had murdered Hugh's grandfather, and once stated that he regreted he could not control the wind. By 1321 he had earned many enemies in every strata of society, from Queen Isabella to the barons to the common people. There was even a bizarre plot to kill Hugh by sticking pins in a wax likeness of him.<br>
<br>
Finally the barons prevailed upon King Edward and forced Hugh and his father into exile in 1321. His father fled to Bordeaux, and Hugh became a pirate in the English channel, "a sea monster, lying in wait for merchants as they crossed his path". The pair returned the next year and King Edward quickly reinstated Hugh as royal favorite. His time in exile had done nothing to quell his greed, his rashness, or his ruthlessness. Queen Isabella fled to France, where she formed a liaison with Roger Mortimer and began planning an invasion. Hugh tried to bribe French courtiers to assassinate Queen Isabella. This plan failing, he instead arranged for the death of Mortimer's uncle, Roger Mortimer of Chirk, who was in his custody. When Mortimer and the queen invaded, King Edward was desposed, Hugh's father was executed, and Hugh himself was captured.<br>
<br>
Hugh tried to starve himself before his trial, but face trial he did on November 24, 1326. He was judged a traitor and a thief, was drawn and quartered, and his testicles were severed and burnt before him. He was beheaded, and his head was mounted on the gates of London.<br>
</p>
Hugh LE DESPENCER
<p>
<a name ="I005292"><b>[I005292]</b></a><br />
Sir Hugh (1223-August 4, 1265) was an important ally of Simon de Montfort during the reign of Henry III. He served briefly as Justiciar of England in 1260 and as Constable of the Tower of London.<br>
<br>
He was summoned to Parliament by Simon de Montfort, and so might be deemed a baron, though the legality of that assembly is doubtful. He remained allied with Montfort to the end, and was present at the Battle of Lewes. He was killed fighting on de Montfort's side at the Battle of Evesham. He was slain by Roger Mortimer, 1st Baron Wigmore; this caused a feud to begin between the Despenser and Mortimer families.<br>
<br>
By his wife, Aline Bassett, he was father of Hugh the elder Despenser.<br>
</p>
Hugh LE DESPENCER
<p>
<a name ="I005290"><b>[I005290]</b></a><br />
Hugh (1262-1326), son of Hugh le Despenser II, sometimes referred to as "the elder Despenser", was for a time the chief adviser to King Edward II of England.<br>
<br>
He was created a baron by writ of summons to Parliament in 1295. He was one of the few barons to remain loyal to Edward during the controversy regarding Piers Gaveston. Despenser became Edward's loyal servant and chief administrator after Gaveston was executed in 1312, but the jealousy of other barons led to his being exiled along with his son in 1321, when Edmund de Woodstoke replaced him as Lord Warden of the Cinque Ports.<br>
<br>
Edward found it difficult to manage without them, and recalled them to England a year later, an action which enraged the queen, Isabella, the more so when Despenser was created Earl of Winchester. When Isabella and her lover, Roger Mortimer, led a rebellion against the king, both Despensers were captured and executed. The elder Despenser was hanged at Bristol on October 27, 1326.<br>
