Dagobert I of AUSTRASIA
<p>
<a name ="I010061"><b>[I010061]</b></a><br />
King of Austrasia, King of France, Greatest of Merovingian Kings<br>
<br>
Dagobert I, King des Francs. Born: in 603, son of Clotaire = Chlothar II, King de Soissons and Bertrude, Some sources assert that Dagobert I was born in the year 606. Note - between 623 and 629: Dagobert I became King of Austrasie in 623 and King of the Franks in 629. At the age of about 25 years, Dagobert, son of Clotaire II and of Bertrade, takes over the succession without difficulty. He must first determine the fate of his half-brother Charibert (son of Queen Sichilde), for whom his uncle Brodulf wanted to yield at least Neustria. Dagobert does not cimply and purely eliminate his half-brother, but he sends him to Aquitaine by yielding to him the cities of Saintes, Perigeux, Toulouse, Cahors, Agen and the countryside between Garonne and the Pyrenees whose residents had taken advantage of the troubles in the kingdom to ally themselves with the Basques. Dagobert wins Dijon and also Saint-Jean-de-Losne where he lives for a few days and meets out justice. The day of his departure from Losne to Chalon, as he bathes before sunrise, he has Brodulf, Uncles of his half-brother Charibert, assassinated, the murder being executed by two of Dagobert's sons and the patrician Guillebaud. In 630, he negotiates a Treaty with the Emperor of Byzantium, Heraclius, a perpetual peace through the intermediary of his envoys, Servais and Paterne. Upon his return to Paris, Dagobert repudiates his wife Gomatrude, sister of Queen Sichilde, herself married to the deceased Clotaire II, Dagobert's father. He immediately, in 631, marries Nanthilde, a simple housekeeper. The reign of Nantilde lasts only a few years. Dagobert surrounds himself with other women, Vulfegonde, then Berthilde, finally Raintrude, an Austrasian, whom he took as concubine in the eighth year of his reign. He was skillfully taught and supported by his Ministers Saint Eloi [who was Dagobert's treasurer and then became Bishop after Dagobert died] and Dadon [alias Saint Ouen, who became Bishop of Rouen in 641 and who was instrumental in the founding of several monasteries including those of Saint-Wandrille, Rebais, and of Jumieges]. He fought the Austrasians and gave them his son, Sigebert, as next king at age 3 [in fact the Bishop of Cologne and a Duke will govern in his name] . With the Austrasian armies and the support of the Saxons and the Lombards, Dagobert overwhelms the Wendes [Slavic resident of the area between the Oder, the Elbe and the superior branch of the Danube] at Wogalisbourg (in Styria, near Gratz) in 632]. He fought the Gascons, the Slavs and the Saxons. He was the last direct Merovingien King, he was able to delay the dissolution of the Frankish Empire. In December of 638, Dagobert is stricken with an intestinal disease in his domaine of Epinay-sur-Seine, and trusts his Mayor of Neustria, Aega, the fate of his wife Nanthilde as well as that of his son Clovis II. On 19 January 639, Dagobert has himself transported to Saint-Denis, where he dies in one of the buildings adjoing the Basilica. He is the first Monarch of France to have chosen Saint-Denis as the final restiing place. It is there that Saint Denis was martyred in the third century, along with his companions Saint Rustique and Saint Eleuthere. In the fifth century, the Gallo-Roman cemetery was levelled and the basilica built. Married before 626: Gomatrude; Gomatrude was the first of five wives. Married before 629: Ragnetrud d'Austrasie; Ragnetrud was the third of Dagobert I's five wives. Married before 634: Nantechild. Died: in 639.<br>
<br>
<br>
From Wikipedia<br>
<br>
Dagobert I (c. 603 - January 19, 639) was the king of the Franks from 629 to 639.<br>
<br>
The son of King Clotaire II, Dagobert became king of Austrasia and on the death of his father, the sole king of the Franks. By 632 he had Bourgogne and Aquitaine under his rule, becoming the most powerful of the Merovingian kings and the most respected ruler in the West. He married five times.<br>
<br>
As king, Dagobert I made Paris his capital. During his reign, he built the Altes Schloss Castle in Meersburg, Germany which today is the oldest inhabited castle in that country. Devoutly religious, Dagobert was also responsible for the construction of the Saint Denis Basilica at the site of a Benedictine Monastery in Paris.<br>
<br>
Dagobert was the last of the Merovingian kings to wield any real royal power. In 632 the nobles of Austrasia revolted under Mayor of the Palace Pepin I, and Dagobert appeased the rebellious nobles by putting his three-year-old son Sigebert III on the Austrasian throne, thereby ceding royal power in all but name. When Dagobert died in 639, another son, Clovis II, inherited the rest of his kingdom at age five.<br>
<br>
This pattern continued for the next century until Pippin III finally deposed the last Merovingian king in 751, establishing the Carolingian dynasty. The Merovingian boy-kings remained ineffective rulers who inherited the throne as young children and lived only long enough to produce a male heir or two, while real power lay in the hands of the noble families (the Old Noblesse) who exercised feudal control over most of the land.<br>
<br>
Dagobert was the first of the French kings to be buried in the Royal tombs at Saint Denis Basilica.<br>
<br>
King Dagobert was immortalized by the song Le bon roi Dagobert (The good king Dagobert), a nursery rhyme featuring exchanges between the king and his chief adviser, St. Eligius (Eloi in the French text). The satirical rhymes place Dagobert in various ridiculous positions, from which Eligius' good advice manages to extract him. The text, which probably originated in the 18th century, became extremely popular as an expression of the anti-monarchist sentiment of the French Revolution. Other than placing Dagobert and Eligius in their respective roles, it has no historical accuracy.<br>
</p>
Sigebert I of AUSTRASIA
<p>
<a name ="I010781"><b>[I010781]</b></a><br />
Sigebert I (535-575) was a Frankish King, one of the sons of Clotaire I and Ingund. He successfully pursued a civil war against his half brother, Chilperic I.<br>
<br>
When Clotaire I died in 561, his kingdom was divided, in accordance with Frankish custom, among his four sons; Sigebert became king of the northeastern portion, known as Austrasia, to which he added further territory on the death of his brother, Charibert, in 567 or 568. Incursions by the Avars, a fierce nomadic tribe related to the Huns, caused him to move his capital from Reims to Metz. He repelled their attacks twice, in 562 and c. 568.<br>
<br>
About 567 he married Brunhilda, daughter of the Visigothic king Athanagild, whose other daughter, Galswintha, married Chilperic I. When Chilperic had Galswintha murdered in order to marry Fredegund, Sigebert sought revenge. The two brothers had already fought each other, but their hostility now elevated into a long and bitter war that was continued by the descendants of both.<br>
<br>
Sigebert defeated Chilperic and conquered most of his kingdom. Chilperic then hid in Tournai. But at Sigebert's moment of triumph, when he had just been declared king by Chilperic's subjects at Vitry, he was struck down by two assassins working for Fredegund.<br>
</p>
Sigebert III of AUSTRASIA
<p>
<a name ="I010310"><b>[I010310]</b></a><br />
Born: in 629, son of Dagobert I, King d'Austrasie and Ragnetrud d'Austrasie, Some sources assert that Sigebert III was born in the year 631. Note - between 633 and 656: Sigebert III, son of Dagobert and Ragnetrude, was King of Austrasie from 633/634 [at which time he is only 9 to 10 years of age -- Thus, Pepin le Vieux or de Landen truly reigns as the Major Domo] to 656. He reigned under the tutellage of Pepin of Landen [when Pepin de Landen died in 640, Otto succeeded him] and of Grimoald. In 641, the nobles of Austrasia have Otto assassinated and Grimolad, son of Pepin becames Mayor of the Palace, and the Francs lose their sovereignty over Thuringia.<br>
<br>
By 643, the Francs would lose all authority over the Allemanians (Germans). Between 644 and 645, after humiliating deafeats against the Thuringians and the Allemanians, Sigebert III, not having any heir, adopts the son of Grimoald and names him Childebert. In 646, Sigebert III's wife gives him a son, Dagobert II, which did not please Grimoald. Ten years later, Sigebert III dies.<br>
<br>
He was a very pious man and founder of numerous monasteries. He was placed among the rank of the saints by the Church. Married before 652: Immachilde=Himenechilde, Queen d'Austrasie. Died: on 1 February 656 in France.<br>
</p>
Theudebert II of AUSTRASIA
<p>
<a name ="I010777"><b>[I010777]</b></a><br />
Theudebert II (586-612), king of Austrasia (595-612), was the son and heir of Childebert II. He received the kingdom of Austrasia at the death of his father in 595, but was dominated by his grandmother Brunhilda, whom he succeeded in driving away in 599. With his brother Theuderic II he resumed the fight against the kingdom of Neustria and defeated Clotaire II, thereby laying his hands on a great portion of his land (600-604). At this point, however, the two brothers took up arms against each other; Theudebert II was defeated at Toul and at Tolbiac in 612. He was locked up in a monastery at the order of his grandmother Brunehaut, and assassinated with his son Mérovée.<br>
</p>
Theuderic III of AUSTRASIA
<p>
<a name ="I095747"><b>[I095747]</b></a><br />
Born: in 651 in Neustrie, son of Clovis II, King de Bourgogne and Sainte Bathilde. Some sources assert that Thierry III was born in 651 while others claim it was circa 654. Note - between 673 and 690: Thierri III became King of Neustrie upon the death of Clotaire III between 10 March and 15 May 673. The Crown was given him by Ebroin, Major Domo. It is Ebroin's excesses which caused the Greats [Optimates] to rebel in 674 and to call upon Childeric II, King of Austrasia for help. Thierri III was de-throned in 674 by Childeric II who died in 675 allowing Thierri III to re-claim the throne. In 674, he was shaven and relegated to Saint-Denis. Ebroin was exiled to the Monastery of Luxeuil [Haute-Saone]. In 676, Thierry III left Saint-Denis to become King of Neustria and of Burgundy with the help of Major Domo Leger. Ebroin, however, first supports Clotaire III, a son of Clovis III, and then he swings to Thierry III.<br>
<br>
Thierry III for his part is first and foremost King of Neustria and of Burgundy and the Greats [Optimates] of Austrasia want a King of their own. Thus, they find Dagobert II, son of Sigebert III, who had been exiled in Ireland. For all practical purposes, Dagobert II is King of Austrasia, whereas Ebroin rules Neustria and Burgundy in the name of Thierry III. By 680, through the death in 679 of Dagobert II, Thierry III is sole King of Gaule. But in reality the antagonism between the Neustrians and the Austrasians was quite aggravated. Austrasia is at that time governed by the grandson of Pepin de Landen, Pepin II, who makes himself Duke of Austrasia, supported by his brother Martin. In the Summer of 680, the two armies join in battle at Leucofao [known today as Bois-du-Fay] in the Ardennes. The Austrasians are defeated and Pepin escapes. Martin is taken prisoner in Laon, where he had sought refuge. Ebroin had promised to let him live, and of course, he rushed to have him executed. Within 3 years Ebroin is himself assassinated by one Ermenfroy who takes refuge in Austrasia. In 687, Pepin II with the help of the Greats [Optimates] of Neustria, invades Neustria from the North-East. Though Thierry III was vanquished at the Battle of Tertry [three leagues from Saint-Quentin] by Pepin II, the latter still recognized Thierry III as King of Neustrie. Married before 674: Amalberge, daughter of Wandregisis and Farahild. Died: between March 691 and April 691.<br>
<br>
Thierry III died in March or April, and his son Clovis IV succeeds him, though he is barely 9 years of age. Thus, Pepin II [Pepin of Herstal] remains the true ruler.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
From Wikipedia<br>
<br>
Theuderic III was a King of the Franks in the 7th century, one of the Merovingian line. He was King of Neustria from 673-675 and served as King of the Franks from 675-691 after the death of his brother Childeric II. His father was Clovis II and his mother was Balthild. He had three children: Clovis III and Childebert III, who later also became kings, and a daughter, Bertha. Theuderic III died in 690.<br>
