Dorothy was a legion member for 29 years of which 20 years were volunteered at the Halifax Scotia Branch Poppy Committee. She also volunteered for several years with the Salvation Army and Visitations with the Veterans at Camp Hill Hospital. Dorothy made many friends over the years through her volunteer work and always enjoyed great conversations and laughter wherever she went. Dorothy was an avid gardener and took great pride maintaining the flower gardens around the senior complex where she lived on Main Street in Halifax for over 24 years. She took great pride in her crafts of crochet and knitted items she made for her family and friends over the years. She didn't believe in wasting valuable time, and every day she strived to make each day count. Dorothy continued to live an active life until her health began to deteriorate in 2014. She was a very proud Mother and Grandmother and loved her family very much.<br>
One of the most treasured and historic time for Dorothy was in 1942.

She was one of 5 women who passed the course and given a job in the Halifax Shipyards. She was the youngest woman, 16 years old and according to today's records Dorothy remains to be the youngest electrical welding woman.<br>

 HENGEST
<p>
<a name ="I015326"><b>[I015326]</b></a><br />
Hengest or Hengist (d. 488?) was a semi-legendary ruler of Kent in southeast England.<br>
<br>
The facts of his life are unknown, but according to Bede (writing nearly 200 years after the events in question), he and his brother Horsa were mercenaries for the British ruler Vortigern, hired to fight against the Picts. Following his victories over the Picts, Hengest invited more immigrants from Germany to settle in Britain and then rebelled against Vortigern, establishing himself as king in Kent.<br>
<br>
Both Hengest and Horsa are described as being Jutes, and sons of a Jutish chief named Wihtgils.<br>
<br>
The actual historical existence of both Hengest and Horsa has been called into question numerous times, with many historians labeling these two as legendary 'divine twins' or culture heros along the order of Romulus and Remus. It is perhaps more likely that Hengest, meaning 'Stallion' in Old English (in modern German 'Hengst' is still the word for a stallion), was an honorific for an actual warlord, while Horsa was a later accretion to the story, perhaps as a misreading of a gloss in a manuscript that was written to define the name Hengest as meaning 'horse'.<br>
<br>
Later accounts, in the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, the Historia Britonum, by Geoffrey of Monmouth, and by Robert Wace add further details from tradition and legend about Hengest's career. The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle dates his death to 488, but does not provide a cause; according to some tellings of the Arthurian legend, he was killed by the British king Uther Pendragon.<br>

Harold Edmund HENN
<p>
<a name ="I001520"><b>[I001520]</b></a><br />
Harold Edmund Henn (Dad) was born with a mischievous glint in his eye on - as he would say - 15 September 1933 on the family farm in the Town of Salem, Pierce County, WI. He was welcomed by parents Edmund and Rosa (nee Kassera) and older siblings John, Harriett, Robert (Bob), Goldeen, Alberta (Bert), and Verona (Vee). Seventeen months later Dad helped the family welcome the youngest, Gale. Dad was baptized at home into the Christian faith. The family later moved to Red Wing, MN, where he was confirmed at First Lutheran Church. Dad often recalled life on the farm, including the excitement they had for peach season as the individual peach wrappings were much preferred in the outhouse over pages from the Sears Roebuck catalog. Dad graduated from Red Wing Central High School in 1952. Dadʼs first love was airplanes and flying and they remained lifelong passions. He joined the Minnesota State Guard and was honorably discharged in 1952. Dad enlisted in the United States Air Force and received the highest score at aircraft maintenance school. During the Korean War he was stationed at Mountain Home Air Force Base, ID, and was honorably discharged in 1956. That same year he accepted a job as a baggage handler for United Airlines in Chicago, IL, while he earned his airframe and powerplant license from the aeronautical university at Midway Airport. In 1957, he was hired by North Central Airlines and transferred to Minneapolis, MN, in 1959, where he remained until his retirement in 1992. During those 33 years his employer changed from North Central Airlines, to Republic Airlines, and finally Northwest Airlines, although he would note his office never changed. While in the State Guard Dad met a man by the name of Herman J. Meyer. On July 16, 1959, Dad was visiting Herman in his garage when his daughter Lora drove in. Dad found much joy in saying he took one look at her and knew he had to marry her as no one else would. This is where we must tell you that Dadʼs love language was sarcasm. No elaborate sonnets for him when a well-placed one-liner was way more efficient. On Halloween, he romantically proposed by saying, "My vacation starts August 19; when do you want to get married?" She fell for it and they married on Sunday, August 21, 1960, at St. Johnʼs Lutheran Church in Red Wing. Dad took aerial photos of the Eisenhower Bridge being constructed next to the old Red Wing bridge and sold them for $1 to pay for their honeymoon trip to Glacier National Park. His thriftiness allowed them a daily budget of $10 for gas, lodging, and food - and the unanticipated alternator brushes. They bought their first house on Prior Lake in Shakopee, MN, living there for nine years before moving to "The Barn" in Bay City, WI, in 1969. During this period they welcomed four daughters: Dena, Beth, Char Lynn, and Ruth. He loved to say they gave us four-letter names as he knew we would never be able to handle anything longer than that. We got our revenge by all being born in May, which led to a months-long confusion of "whose birthday is it today?" for the rest of his life. Later Dad proudly became a grandfather to Nathan Swanson. For all his sarcasm, Dad took his role as daddy very seriously. He worked extremely hard to provide fun family activities for us that grew and changed when we did. When the Piper J-3 Cub was too small, it was upgraded to a Tri-Pacer. When this plane was too small for a family of six it was replaced by a houseboat. As Dena and Beth went off to college and Char Lynn and Ruth started working, the houseboat was replaced by the first of two sailboats. As he aged the sailboat was replaced by an MG that was not driven in Red Wing because Dad wanted to avoid all the traffic. This is the part where Dad leans in and says, "None of this would have been possible without your mother." Mom and Dad were a true team for sixty years, giving each other credit for their contributions to the family they loved. Mom willingly played disciplinarian so that when Dad was not working or fixing things we could have fun with him. In turn he did his absolute best to derail her plans for raising four young ladies by telling jokes about bodily functions every chance he got.<br>
Dad is survived by loving wife, Lora; adoring daughters Dena Swanson of Neenah, WI, Beth Henn (Rod Johnson) of West St. Paul, MN, Char Lynn Henn of Red Wing, MN, and Ruth (Mike) Kuehni of Bay City, WI; grandson, Nathan Swanson of Neenah, WI; brother Gale (Linda) Henn of Hastings, MN; and many nieces and nephews.<br>
He was greeted in heaven by parents Ed and Rose; brothers John and Bob; sisters Harriett, Goldeen, Bert, and Vee; parents-in-law Herman and Clara Meyer; son-in-law Jon Swanson; two nephews; and four nieces.<br>
