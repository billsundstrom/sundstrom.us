David I of SCOTLAND
<p>
<a name ="I006362"><b>[I006362]</b></a><br />
David I, known as "the Saint", (1084 - May 24, 1153), king of Scotland, the youngest son of Malcolm Canmore and of Saint Margaret (sister of Edgar Ætheling), was born in 1084. He married in 1113 Matilda, daughter and heiress of Waltheof, Earl of Northumbria, and thus gained possession of the earldom of Huntingdon.<br>
<br>
On the death of Edgar, king of Scotland, in 1107, the territories of the Scottish crown were divided in accordance with the terms of his will between his two brothers, Alexander and David. Alexander, together with the crown, received Scotland north of the Forth and Clyde, David the southern district with the title of earl of Cumbria. The death of Alexander in 1124 gave David possession of the whole starting on April 27 of that year.<br>
<br>
In 1127, in the character of an English baron, he swore fealty to Matilda as heiress to her father Henry I, and when the usurper Stephen ousted her in 1135 David vindicated her cause in arms and invaded England. But Stephen marched north with a great army, whereupon David made peace. The peace, however, was not kept. After threatening an invasion in 1137, David marched into England in 1138, but sustained a crushing defeat on Cutton Moor in the engagement known as the Battle of the Standard.<br>
<br>
He returned to Carlisle, and soon afterwards concluded peace. In 1141 he joined Matilda in London and accompanied her to Winchester, but after a narrow escape from capture he returned to Scotland. Henceforth he remained in his own kingdom and devoted himself to its political and ecclesiastical reorganization. A devoted son of the church, he founded five bishoprics and many monasteries. In secular politics he energetically forwarded the process of feudalization which his immediate predecessors had initiated . He died at Carlisle.<br>
<br>
He had two sons, Malcolm (not to be confused with Malcolm IV of Scotland, this Malcolm's nephew) and Henry and two daughters, Claricia and Hodierna.<br>
</p>
Edith of SCOTLAND
<p>
<a name ="I004998"><b>[I004998]</b></a><br />
From Wikipedia<br>
<br>
Edith of Scotland, (c.1080-May 1, 1118) was the wife of Henry I of England. She was the daughter of Malcolm III of Scotland and St. Margaret of Scotland. Robert Curthose had stood as godfather at her christening.<br>
<br>
When she was about six-years-old Edith and her sister, Mary, were sent to Romsey, where their aunt Christina was abbess. During her stay at Romsey and Wilton, Edith was much sought-after as a bride; she turned down proposals from both William de Warenne, 2nd Earl of Surrey, and Alan Rufus, Lord of Richmond. Hermann of Tournai even claims that William Rufus considered marrying her.<br>
<br>
After the death of King William Rufus in August 1100, his brother Henry quickly seized the royal treasury and the royal crown. His next task was to marry, and Henry's choice fell on Edith. Because Edith had spent most of her life in a nunnery, there was some controversy over whether or not she had been veiled as a nun. Henry sought permission for the marriage from Archbishop Anselm of Canterbury, who returned to England in September 1100 after a long exile. Edith testified to the archbishop that she had never taken holy vows. She insisted that her aunt Christina had veiled her only to protect her "from the lust of the Normans". Edith claimed she had pulled the veil off and stamped on it, and her aunt beat and scolded her most horribly for this. Archbishop Anselm concluded that Edith had never been a nun, and gave his permission for the marriage.<br>
<br>
Edith and Henry seem to have known one another for some time before their marriage -- William of Malmesbury states that Henry had "long been attached" to her, and Orderic Vitalis says that Henry had "long adored" Edith's character. Through her mother she was descended from Edmund II of England; this was very important as Henry wanted to help make himself more popular with the English people and Edith represented the old English dynasty. In their children the Norman and Anglo-Saxon dynasties would be united.<br>
<br>
Edith and Henry were married on November 11, 1100 at Westminster Abbey by Archbishop Anselm of Canterbury. She was crowned as "Matilda", a fashionable Norman name. She and Henry had two children:<br>
   1. Maud, born February 1102<br>
   2. William Adelin, born 1103<br>
<br>
She maintained her court primarily at Westminster, but accompanied her husband in his travels all across England, and in 1106/1107, Edith visited Normandy with Henry. Her court was filled with musicians and poets; she commissioned Turgot to write a biography of her mother, Saint Margaret. She was an active queen, and like her mother was renowned for her devotion to religion and the poor. William of Malmesbury describes her as attending church barefoot at Lent, and washing the feet and kissing the hands of the sick. After her death in 1118 she was remembered by her subjects as "Matilda the Good Queen" and "Matilda of Blessed Memory", and for a time sainthood was sought for her, though she was never canonized. Henry married again four years after her death.<br>

Malcolm III of SCOTLAND

<a name ="I006364"><b>[I006364]</b></a><br />
First marriage to  Finnsdottir Ingibiorg Earls Mother<br>
Children by that marriage:<br>
  Malcolm of Scotland<br>
  Donald of Scotland<br>
  Duncan King of Scotland II b: ABT. 1060<br>
<br>
King Malcolm III of Scotland (Máel Coluim mac Donnchada), (1031-November 13, 1093) also known as Malcolm Canmore (Malcolm with the large head)'Cean Mor' meaning 'Big Head' in Gaidhlig, was the eldest son of King Duncan I of Scotland and first king of the House of Dunkeld.<br>
<br>
In 1040 his father was killed in battle by his cousin Macbeth I of Scotland who became the new king. Malcolm found refuge in England under the protection of King Hardicanute of Denmark and England. In 1042 Hardicanute died and was succeeded to the throne of England by his half-brother King Edward the Confessor. In 1053 Edward finally agreed to help Malcolm gain the throne of Scotland by offering him an army. Malcolm's invasion of Scotland started in the same year. Malcolm found support from the nobles of Southern Scotland. He managed to kill first Macbeth in 1057 and then his successor King Lulach I of Scotland in 1058. He then succeeded Lulach as king. He was crowned at Scone Abbey, Perthshire, on April 25, 1058. He married Ingibjörg Finnsdóttir, widow of the Jarl of Orkney, in about 1065 and they had three sons: Duncan, Domnall (d.1085), and Malcolm (d. after 1094). Ingibjörg was dead by 1070, when he wed Margaret.<br>
<br>
He agreed on an alliance with England, sealed by his (second) marriage to Saint Margaret, Edgar Atheling's sister. Margaret herself promoted the Roman Catholic Church in Scotland throughout Malcolm's reign. At that time, Christianity did exist in Scotland in the form of the Celtic Church, but varied from Roman Catholic practice in some respects e.g. the dating of Easter and the shape of monks' tonsures. Malcolm had several sons by Margaret - these became known as the Margaretsons. Malcolm and Margaret's children were:<br>
<br>
   1. Prince Edward of Scotland, killed 1093.<br>
   2. King Edmund I of Scotland<br>
   3. Ethelred, Earl of Fife<br>
   4. King Edgar I of Scotland<br>
   5. King Alexander I of Scotland<br>
   6. King David I of Scotland<br>
   7. Edith of Scotland, also called Matilda, married King Henry I of England<br>
   8. Mary of Scotland, married Eustace III of Boulogne<br>
<br>
During his reign Scotland fell under the influence of England. The Lowlands of Scotland started speaking an early Scots dialect and adopting Anglo-Saxon habits. Malcolm unsuccessfully tried to stop this influence by waging wars against the Norman kings of England after 1066. In 1072 he was forced to give an oath of subservience to William I of England.<br>
<br>
His war against William II of England in 1093 only led to the loss of Scottish territory to England. Malcolm died on November of the same year in an ambush at Alnwick during a battle against William's army. His eldest son by Margaret, Edward, also died in that ambush. Malcolm was succeeded by his brother Donald III of Scotland.<br>
<br>
Malcolm established the Dunkeld dynasty which ruled Scotland from 1058 until 1286. Four of his sons (Duncan II, Edgar, Alexander I, and David I) became kings of Scotland, whilst a fifth (Edmund) ruled as co-ruler of Scotland with his uncle Donald III.<br>

Maldred of SCOTLAND
<p>
<a name ="I005453"><b>[I005453]</b></a><br />
Brother of Duncan, King of Scots 1034-1040. Son of Crinan the Thane and Bethoch, daughter of Malcolm II, King of Scots<br>
</p>
Margaret of SCOTLAND
<p>
<a name ="I006365"><b>[I006365]</b></a><br />
From Wikipedia<br>
<br>
Saint Margaret of Scotland (circa 1045 - November 16, 1093), Edgar Atheling's sister, married King Malcolm Canmore.<br>
<br>
The daughter of the English prince Edward the Exile or "Edward Outremer", son of Edmund Ironside, Margaret was probably born in Hungary. The provenance of her mother Agatha is disputed: certainly related to the kings of Hungary, she was either a descendant of Emperor Henry III or a daughter of Yaroslav I of Kiev.<br>
<br>
When her uncle, King Edward the Confessor, died in 1066, she was living in England where her brother, Edgar Atheling, had decided to make a claim to the vacant throne. After the conquest of England by the Normans, the widowed Agatha decided to leave Northumberland with her children and return to the Continent, but a storm drove their ship to Scotland where they sought the protection of King Malcolm Canmore. Malcolm was a widower, and taken with Margaret's beauty and viture. The marriage of Malcolm and Margaret soon took place and was followed by several invasions of Northumberland by the Scottish king, probably in support of the claims of his brother-in-law Edgar. These, however, had little result beyond the devastation of the province.<br>
<br>
Far more important were the effects of this alliance upon the history of Scotland. A considerable portion of the old Northumbrian kingdom had been reduced by the Scottish kings in the previous century, but up to this time the English population had little influence upon the ruling element of the kingdom. Malcolm's marriage undoubtedly improved the condition of the English to a great extent, and under Margaret's sons, Edgar, Alexander I and David I, the Scottish court practically became anglicized. Margaret was very religious, and saw to the building of churches and the preservation of sacred relics. She rebuilt the monastery of Iona, and provided a free ferry and housing for pilgrims coming to visit the shrine of Saint Andrew. She was a lavish alms-giver, and paid the ransoms of English hostages held by the Scots.<br>
<br>
Margaret and Malcolm had eight children, six sons and two daughters:<br>
   1. Prince Edward of Scotland, killed 1093.<br>
   2. King Edmund I of Scotland<br>
   3. Ethelred, Earl of Fife<br>
   4. King Edgar I of Scotland<br>
   5. King Alexander I of Scotland<br>
   6. King David I of Scotland<br>
   7. Edith of Scotland, also called Matilda, married King Henry I of England<br>
   8. Mary of Scotland, married Eustace III of Boulogne<br>
<br>
Her husband Malcolm and their eldest son Edward were killed in battle against the English in November 1093. Her son Edmund was left with the task of telling his mother of their deaths. Margaret was ill, and she died on 16 November, 1093, four days after the deaths her husband and her eldest son.<br>
<br>
She was canonised in 1251 by Pope Innocent IV on account of her great benefactions to the Church. The Roman Catholic church formerly marked the feast of Saint Margaret of Scotland on June 10, but the date was transferred to November 16 in the liturgical reform of 1972.<br>

<a name ="I016233"><b>[I016233]</b></a><br />
William I (William the Lion, William Leo, William Dunkeld or William Canmore), (1142/1143 - December 4, 1214) reigned as King of Scotland from 1165 to 1214. His reign was the longest in Scottish history before the Act of Union with England in 1707. He became King following his brother Malcolm IV's death on 9 December 1165 and was crowned on 24 December 1165.<br>
<br>
Traditionally, William founded Arbroath Abbey, the site of the later Declaration of Arbroath. Interestingly, he was not known as "The Lyon" during his own lifetime, and the sobriquet did not relate to his tenacious character or his military prowess. The name "The Lion" became attached to him because of his flag or standard, a red lion rampant on a yellow background. This went on to become the Royal standard of Scotland; the British Monarch when in Scotland still uses it today. The rampant lion also forms part of the Royal Standard of the United Kingdom.<br>
<br>
William also arranged the Auld Alliance, the first treaty for mutual self-defence between nations. Scotland, France, and Norway subscribed to the treaty. Although Norway never took much part in it, it played a role in Franco-Scottish (and English) affairs until 1746.<br>
<br>
William also inherited the title of Earl of Northumbria in 1152. However he had to give up this title to King Henry II of England in 1157. This caused trouble after William became king, since he spent a lot of effort trying to regain Northumbria.<br>
<br>
William was a key rebel in the Revolt of 1173-1174 against Henry II. In 1174, during a raid in support of the revolt William was captured by Henry's troops and taken in chains to Northampton, and then transferred to Falaise in Normandy. Henry then sent an army to Scotland and occupied it. As ransom and to regain his kingdom, William had to acknowledge Henry as his feudal superior and agree to pay for the cost of the English army's occupation of Scotland by taxing the Scots. This he did by signing the Treaty of Falaise. He was then allowed to return to Scotland.<br>
<br>
The Treaty of Falaise remained in force for the next fifteen years. At the end of that time the new English king, Richard the Lionheart, agreed to terminate it in return for 10,000 silver marks. Richard needed the money to take part in the Third Crusade.<br>
<br>
Because of his need for an alliance with England, William married Ermengarde de Beaumont, a granddaughter of King Henry I of England, in 1186. The marriage was not very successful, and it was many years before an heir, Alexander, was born. William and Ermengarde's children were:<br>
   1. Margaret (1193-1259), married Hubert de Burgh, 1st Earl of Kent.<br>
   2. Isabella (1195-1253), married Roger Bigod, 4th Earl of Norfolk.<br>
   3. Alexander II of Scotland (1198-1249), reigned 1214-1249.<br>
   4. Marjorie (1200-1244), married Gilbert Marshal, 4th Earl of Pembroke.<br>
<br>
<br>
William died in Stirling in 1214 and lies buried in Arbroath Abbey. His son, Alexander II, succeeded him as king.<br>

William "The Lion" was a grandson of King David I and came to the throne after the death of his elder brother, Malcolm IV in 1165. The nickname "The Lion" was accorded to him after his death and may have been due either to his valour and strength in battle (though he was not always successful) or, more likely, to the heraldic symbol which he adopted - the red lion rampant on a yellow background - which has remained a royal symbol to this day.<br>
<br>
William was crowned at Scone on December 24, 1165 at the age of 22 and was to reign for nearly 50 years - a prodigious length of time by any standards, but unheard of in those violent days.<br>
<br>
William was red-haired and energetic. Early in his reign he attempted to recover land in Northumberland which had been given to King David in 1149 by King Stephen of England but which had been ceded by his brother Malcolm. The stories of his butchery of the local population were chronicled in detail by later (English) historians. However, he was ultimately unsuccessful as he was surprised by an attack by the English army while besieging Alnwick castle. In the mist, he mistook a party of English knights for his own. He is said to have fought fearlessly but his horse was speared and he was captured. He spent five months as a prisoner of Henry II while the English army plundered the south of Scotland as far as Edinburgh.<br>
<br>
William was only released under the Treaty of Falaise. Under this, William was forced to swear allegiance to King Henry II of England and English garrisons remained in the castles which had been captured. This lasted until after Henry's death in 1189. At that stage he was able to negotiate out of the oath by providing money to King Richard (the Lionheart) who needed finance to go on a crusade to the Holy Land.<br>
<br>
In 1178 William founded the Abbey of Arbroath which was dedicated to Thomas à Becket who had been murdered by Henry II in 1170. The Abbey was later to be place where the famous "Declaration of Arbroath" was signed in 1320 by the Scottish nobles in the time of Robert the Bruce.<br>
<br>
William failed to assert his authority over the rebellious south-west of Scotland. This was not helped by the fact that he had to first ask permission of his "liege-lord" Henry to be allowed to deal with the matter. William captured one of the ring-leaders but had to send him to Henry to be dealt with. Henry demand an oath of loyalty - and promptly returned the outlaw to Galloway where he immediately attacked William's garrison.<br>
<br>
William is known to have been planning another invasion of England to retake Northumberland early in the 13th century after King John came to the throne of England and there were a number of skirmishes along the border. But he eventually negotiated a treaty instead - he is said to have had a "divine warning" of the consequences of invasion.<br>
<br>
In 1186 William married Ermengarde de Beaumont who at last bore him a son in 1198 (later King Alexander II) when William was aged 53. He also had three daughters (all of whom married English nobles as part of the peacemaking process with King John of England).<br>
