<a name ="I079936"><b>[I079936]</b></a><br />
The sudden death this week of a prominent Lennox man, Richard Mattheis, came as a great shock to his family and friends in this community. Apparently in fairly good health and active everyday, Mr. Matthies became ill about seven o'clock Monday morning while attending the men's Bible study breakfast at Sunrise Manor. He was assisted to his home -- only a block away -- by Rev. Elster. He had apparently suffered a heart attack and the ambulance was summoned.<br>
After being admitted to Sioux Valley hospital he had another attack. However, he appeared to rally and was alert most of the day. Mr. Mattheis passed peacefully into that eternal rest at 3:45 p.m. Monday, Dec. 19. moments after suffering a third heart attack. He attained the age of 76 years and 23 days.<br>

Since that time he was a seed corn dealer and continued to remain active. <br>
With his death a marriage partnership of over 52 years has come to an end.<br>

(Delores) Whitney and Mrs. Elroy (Gladys) Musch, both of Sioux Falls; eight grandchildren; two great-grandchildren; four brothers, Rudolph Matthies of Mesa, AZ., Ernest Mattheis of Syracuse, NYl, Rev.

Carl Franklyn MATTHEWS
<p>
<a name ="I022073"><b>[I022073]</b></a><br />
I suspect that carl was adopted along with his sister, because he does not appear with his parents in the 1901 census. The 1911 census states he and his sister were born in the USA.  Perhaps they had the same birth parents. <br>
Ancestry.com conains a tree with his name listed as Carl Franklyn Matthews with his parents listed as Frank James and Anna (Hutchinson) Matthews, who would be his adoptive parents.<br>
