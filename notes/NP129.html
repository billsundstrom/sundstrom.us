Gilbert DE GAND
<p>
<a name ="I007338"><b>[I007338]</b></a><br />
Few among the Conqueror's companions of arms were so splendidly rewarded as Gilbert de Gant, who held one hundred and seventy-two English manors; yet there is much doubt - or at least much difference of opinion - as to who he really was. Dugdale, and after him Sir Henry Ellis and others, have called him a younger son of Baldwin, Earl of Flanders, and consequently the nephew of Queen Matilda; but his opinion appears to be now altogether exploded. Mr. Freeman discards it as 'an amazing piece of genealogy,' and promptly dubs him 'a Flemish adventurer,' without stooping to explain how or whay it was that a mere soldier of fortune received so vast a grant of territory. On the other hand, the author of 'The Norman People' furnishes him with a lineage more consonant with his fortunes, tracing his direct descent from Witikind, the renowned opponent of Charlemagne in the eight century. 'When, after many years of resistance, Witikind was compelled to submit, c 780, he was invested with the Dukedom of Angria (L'Art de Verifier les Dates, xvi 145). Ludolphus, one of his descendants, was Duke of Saxony, and died in 864, leaving by his wife (a daughter of Eberhard, Duke of Friuli), Bruno Duke of Saxony. He married a daughter of the Emperor Arnold, and declined the Imperial throne. Bruno had two sons, 1. Henry the Fowler, Emperor in 919, father of the Emperor Otho, who succeeded 936, 2. Wickman. Wickman was created Count of Gand 940, by the Emperor Otho, his nephew, and had two sons: 1. Theodoric, Count of Gand, ancestor of the Counts of Gand and Guisnes; 2. Adalbert, father of Ralph, father of Baldwin de Gand, Count of Gand or Alos, ancestor of the Counts of Alost, whose younger brother, Gilbert de Gand, became Baron of Folkingham in England.' Gilbert was, if not the nephew, the cousin of Queen Matilda; and could claim our great King Alfred as one of his ancestors. 'He was sixth in male descent from Wickman, Count of the Castle of Gand,' who had married Leutgarde, granddaughter of Elfthryth, Countess of Flanders, the daughter of Alfred.' - A.S. Ellis.<br>
<br>
Gilbert, among his other possessions, received the broad lands of Ulf the Constable, lying chiefly in the counties of Nottingham and Lincoln, and chose his predecessor's capital manor, Folkingham, near Grantham, as the head of his barony.<br>
<br>
The first mention of him is in 1068, when the Conqueror, after the surrender of the city of York placed it under the joint command of William Malet, Robert FitzGilbert, and Gilbert de Gand; and he an Malet were still in charge when, in the following year, the Danes landed in England, besieged and captured the city, and put the garrison to the sword. Only Malet, with his wife and two children, Gilbert and a few others, were spared for ransom or exchange. He died during the reign of Rufus, and was buried in Bardney Abbey, which he had re-founded and re-endowed about 1086-89. It had lain in ruins for more than three centuries, having been destroyed by the Danes under Ingmacr and Hubba.<br>
<br>
'He had by Alice his wife, daughter of Hugh de Montfort, Lord of Monfort-sur-Risle, and eventually heiress of her brother, 1. Gilbert de Gand, who died without issue in his lifetime; 2, Hugh, who inheriting the extensive fief of his mother's family in Normandy, took the name of Montfort, and was ancestor of the lords of that place and Coquainvilliers. He married Adeline, sister of Waleran, Count of Mellan, and being soon after drawn with him into the revolt in Normandy in favour of William Clito in 1123, was taken prisoner, and Ordericus, writing apparently in 1135, says 'he has now groaned in fetters for thirteen years;' 3, Walter de Gand, ancestor of the Earls of Lincoln; 4, Robert de Gand, most probably another son, Provost of Beverley under the celebrated Thomas a Beckett, Dean of York, and Chancellor to King Stephen; 5, Ralph de Gand, perhaps another son, besieged the castle of Montfort-sur-Risle by Henry I in 1123; and three daughters at least: 1, Emma, married to Alan de Percy; 2, Agnes? wife of William FitzNigel, Constable of Chester to Earl Hugh; and 3, ? married to Ivo de Grentemesnil (Ord. Vit. VIII. xvi).' - A.S. Ellis [Battle Abbey Roll III:307-308]<br>
<br>
<br>
Who were the parents of Gilbert de Gant?<br>
compiled by Raymond W. Phair<br>
<br>
His parents very probably were Ralph, lord of Alost (Aalst in Flemish), and Gisele, daughter of Frederick count of Luxembourg.<br>
<br>
Sherman has given the most recent detailed account which is the basis for what is summarized below, unless another reference is stated. All the records cited by Sherman have been published. He emphasized the evidence was very strong, but not conclusive.<br>
<br>
Gilbert I de Gant (d. ca.1095) was in England by 1069 when he and William Malet unsuccessfully defended York castle against the Danish invasion and local rebellion [Sherman; EYC 2:432; CP 6:672n; P. Dalton, Conquest, anarchy and lordship, 1994, p.11].<br>
<br>
A 1075 transaction in the Watten abbey chronicle was witnessed by Gilbert, described as having come from England and as the brother of Baldwin of Ghent. In 1052 Ralph of Ghent and his son Baldwin attested a charter of the abbey of Saint Peter of Mount Blandin, Ghent (Gand, Gent), presumably the same Baldwin. Their records are the main source of information for this family.<br>
<br>
Ralph the Advocate was one of the advocates of Saint Peter from as early as 1026 to sometime before 1058. He was succeeded by Baldwin the Advocate. They are believed to be Gilbert's father and brother mentioned in the previous paragraph. It is from their service as advocates that some members of their family were called 'de Gandavo' (of Ghent). Sherman proposed the castellans of Ghent were the other family of advocates of Saint Peter. He also noted that while Gilbert's family were the lords of what was probably the county of Alost, they were never titled counts in any records.<br>
<br>
In a 1094 gift to the abbey of Bergues St. Winnoc, witnessed by Baldwin of Ghent (son of Gilbert's brother Baldwin who d. 1082), Ralph the Chamberlain identified himself as a son of Ralph of Alost and Gisele. He was a fellow witness with Gilbert to the 1075 transaction mentioned above. He may have been the Ralph son of Ralph in a 1056 charter of Saint Peter, prior to his appointment as chamberlain. Alternatively, the 1056 Ralph son of Ralph might have been Gilbert's father, but he appeared to have been dead in that year, or someone unrelated.<br>
<br>
The annals of Saint Peter record about 1042 a gift from Ralph of Ghent and his wife Gisele -- their earliest joint appearance. They had at least 3 sons: Baldwin (their heir), Ralph the Chamberlain, and Gilbert. It is thus extremely probable that she was the unidentified Gisele in 1056 and 1058 who gave land and a serf to the abbey for the souls of her father, her husband Ralph, and her sons. Both of her gifts were witnessed by Baldwin, Ralph, and Gilbert, described as her sons. Although they were not called 'of Alost' or 'of Ghent', it would be an extraordinary coincidence if these were not the members of that family.<br>
<br>
Rubincam, using a source not used by Sherman (and published after Vanderkindere), found that in 1036 Ralph of Ghent and his wife Gisele made a gift to the abbey. Neither Rubincam nor Sherman provided sufficient details to determine if this was the gift Sherman reported occurred in 1042. Rubincam also found, but didn't cite a source, that Ralph in 1056 witnessed a gift by count Baldwin to the abbey of St. Omer. Rubincam believed he was Gilbert's father, but he was probably the brother.<br>
<br>
Assuming this was Gilbert de Gant in the 1056 gift and that he was about 16 or older, then he was born about 1040 or earlier. His brother Baldwin was probably the Baldwin of Ghent who witnessed a Saint Peter charter in 1046, suggesting he was born about 1030 or earlier.<br>
<br>
Also, if that was a grant by Gilbert's mother, then his father Ralph had apparently died sometime between 1052 (his last occurrence) and 1056. His parentage is unknown, but it seems likely that he was a descendant of the Ralph the Advocate who appeared in the abbey's records in 994.<br>
<br>
Vanderkindere (1:121) mentioned a Baldwin appeared as advocate in 962 (not discussed by Sherman) who may thus be another ancestor of Ralph. Moriarty assumed Baldwin was the father of the earlier Ralph who was in turn the father of Ralph husband of Gisele. In view of the large gaps, however, there may have been additional generations.<br>
<br>
Gilbert's mother was probably the Gisele who was a sister of Otgiva (Ogive), wife of Baldwin IV count of Flanders, and thus Gilbert was one of Charlemagne's descendants. The burials of both Otgiva (d. 21 Feb 1030) and Gisele (d. 21 May, year unknown) are mentioned in the annals of Saint Peter, but it, unfortunately, did not name Gisele's husband.<br>
<br>
Europaische Stammtafeln (ES), 6:128 (1978), identified Gisele as a daughter of count Frederick and wife of Ralph of Alost, but didn't show their children on that page. It also showed her sister Otgiva married about 1005 Baldwin IV. ES 2:5 (1984) had 1012 for Otgiva's marriage date, as did K.F. Werner's 'Die Nachkommen Karls des Grossen', in Karl der Grosse, ed. W. Braunfels, vol.4 (1967).<br>
<br>
Sherman wondered if the erroneous ancestry for Gilbert given in Monasticon Anglicanum (5:491) may have arisen when the unknown author, writing after 1307, found in an unknown source that Gilbert was described as 'nepos' of William the Conqueror and assumed it to mean 'nephew', although in this case its less frequent meaning of 'kinsman' was intended. Gilbert was the first cousin once removed of William's wife, if the assumption about Gisele's identity is correct.<br>
<br>
Gilbert's name appears to have come from his mother's family -- her older brother was Gilbert count of Luxembourg (1047-59), and she had a paternal uncle also named Gilbert. He had a son named Ralph and a grandson named Baldwin, while his brother Baldwin of Ghent named one of his sons Gilbert [CP 7:672; Sherman].<br>
<br>
Sherman didn't mention if any tenants of Gilbert de Gant in England can be traced to Flanders. Gilbert did not seem to hold any land in Flanders.<br>
<br>
The identification of Gilbert's father as Ralph of Alost first appeared in A. Duchesne, Histoire genealogique des maisons ... de Gand, ..., 1631. Among the many later writers who have given it were the following:<br>
* L.V.J.A. Vanderkindere, Histoire de la formation territoriale des principautes belges au moyen age, vol.1 (1899).<br>
* W. Farrer, Early Yorkshire Charters (EYC), 2:432 (1915).<br>
* Complete Peerage (CP), 7:672n (1929).<br>
* M. Rubincam, 'The true origin of the house of Gaunt', Genealogists' magazine, 9:1-7 (1940).<br>
* F.M. Stenton, Anglo-Saxon England, 1st ed., 1941, p.621; 3rd ed., 1971, p.629 (no source). D.C. Douglas, William the Conqueror, 1964, p.267, only cited Stenton for it.<br>
* G.A. Moriarty, 'The ancestry of Gilbert de Gant', The American Genealogist, 34:39-40 (1958).<br>
* R.M. Sherman, 'The continental origins of the Ghent family of Lincolnshire', Nottingham Medieval Studies, 22:23-35 (1978).<br>
<br>
Sherman did not use Farrer, Rubincam, nor Moriarty. See his paper for references to additional works discussing this family.<br>

Emma, daughter of Gilbert de Gant (himself son of Baldwin, Count of Flanders, and nephew of Queen Matilda or Maud, wife of William I The Conqueror) by Gilbert's wife Alice, herself daughter of Hugh de Montfort. [Burke's Peerage]<br>
<br>
Note: Jim Weber does not agree with the above parentage for Gilbert.<br>
<br>
-------------------------------<br>
<br>
More Important NOTE: Ancestral Roots, in a revised lineage for the 7th edition, states that Gilbert's parents are Gisele (or Gisla) of Luxembourg and Rudolph I of Aalst (or Alost) (also called Ralph de Gand or Ghent). Whoever AR had as parents of Gilbert in prior editions had been removed based on new evidence. The parentage will go with AR.<br>
<br>
Gilbert de Gant (Gaunt or Ghent), d. c 1095, buried Bardney, probably arrived in England in 1066; was a commander in York 1068, and was taken prisoner there by the Danes in 1069. He was a tenant-in-chief and one of the largest landholders in co. Lincoln in 1086. Folkingham being the head of his barony; m. Alice de Montfort, daughter of Count Hugh de Montfort-sur-Risle.

Ranulph DE GERNON
<p>
<a name ="I005382"><b>[I005382]</b></a><br />
Ranulph de Gernon was 2nd Earl of Chester, Vicomte d'Avranches in Normandy. He was born 1100, Castle of Gernon in Normandy, France. Ranulph was the son of Ranulph III le Meschin, first Earl of Chester and Lucy. In 1141, he married Maud of Gloucester (d. 29 July 1189), daughter of Robert de Caen, Earl of Gloucester and Maud Fitz-Hamon. Ranulph and Maud had a son, Hugh of Kevelioc (1147-1180).<br>
</p>
Baudouin II DE HAINAULT
<p>
<a name ="I007965"><b>[I007965]</b></a><br />
Baldwin II (1056-1098) was count of Hainaut from 1071 to his death. He was the younger son of Baldwin VI, Count of Flanders and became Count after the death of his older brother, Arnulf III, Count of Flanders. The family claim to the title Count of Flanders was lost by his brother's death. He married Ida of Louvain (a sister of Godfrey I, Duke of Lower Lorraine) in 1084. Baldwin joined the First Crusade and was sent back to Constantinople with Hugh of Vermandois after the siege of Antioch in 1098, to seek assistance from Byzantine emperor Alexius I. However, Baldwin disappeared during a raid by the Seljuk Turks in Anatolia, and was presumably killed.<br>
</p>
Baudouin IV DE HAINAULT
<p>
<a name ="I007961"><b>[I007961]</b></a><br />
Baldwin IV (1108 - November 8, 1171) was count of Hainaut from 1120 to his death. Baldwin married Alice of Namur, heiress of Namur, and had the following issue:<br>

Baldwin V of Hainaut (1150 - December 17, 1195) was count of Hainaut (c. 1120-1195), count of Flanders as Baldwin VIII (1191-1195) and margrave of Namur as Baldwin I (1189-1195). Namur was acquired by his Alice of Namur, heiress of county and Flanders via his marriage to Countess Margaret I of Flanders in 1169. With Margaret, Baldwin had the following issue:<br>

Baudouin VI DE HAINAULT
<p>
<a name ="I008356"><b>[I008356]</b></a><br />
From Wikipedia<br>
<br>
Baldwin I (1172 - 1205), the first emperor of the Latin Empire of Constantinople, as Baldwin IX Count of Flanders and as Baldwin VI Count of Hainaut, was one of the most prominent leaders of the Fourth Crusade, which resulted in the capture of Constantinople, the conquest of the greater part of the Byzantine Empire, and the foundation of the Latin Empire, also known as Romania (not to be confused with modern Romania).<br>
<br>
Early life<br>
Baldwin was the son of Baldwin V of Hainaut, and Margaret I, sister of Philip of Alsace and Countess of Flanders. When Philip died childless in 1191, he was succeeded in Flanders by Baldwin V, who ruled as Baldwin VIII of Flanders by right of marriage.<br>
<br>
In 1186, the younger Baldwin married Marie of Champagne, daughter of count Henry I of Champagne. The chronicler Gislebert describes Baldwin as being infatuated with his young bride, who nevertheless preferred prayer to the marital bed. Gislebert claims Baldwin was "tied only to one woman", his wife.<br>
<br>
Through Marie, Baldwin had additional connections and obligations to the defenders of Holy Land: Her brother Henry II of Champagne had been King of Jerusalem in the 1190s (leaving a widow and two daughters who needed help to keep and regain their territories in Palestine). Marie's uncles Richard I of England and Philip II of France had just been on the Third Crusade.<br>
<br>
Baldwin's own family had also been involved in defence of Jerusalem: his uncle Philip had died on Crusade. Baldwin's mother's mother was great-aunt of Isabella, Queen of Jerusalem and the Counts of Flanders had tried to help Jerusalem relatives in their struggle. Baldwin wanted to continue the tradition.<br>
<br>
Margaret died in 1194, and the younger Baldwin became Count of Flanders. His father died the next year, and he succeeded to Hainaut.<br>
<br>
Count of Flanders and Hainaut<br>
Baldwin took possession of a much-reduced Flanders, for his uncle had given a large chunk, including Artois, as dowry to Baldwin's sister Isabelle of Hainaut on her marriage to King Philip II of France, and another significant piece to his own wife. Isabelle had died in 1190, but King Philip still retained her dowry, on behalf of Isabella's son, the future Louis VIII of France. The eight years of Baldwin's rule in Flanders were dominated by his attempts to recover some of this land, culminating in January 1200 in the Treaty of Péronne, in which Philip returned most of Artois.<br>
<br>
In this fight against the French king, Baldwin allied with others who had quarrels with Philip, including kings Richard I and John of England, and the German King Otto IV.<br>
<br>
A month after the treaty, on February 23, 1200, Baldwin took the cross (committed to embark on the Fourth Crusade). He spent the next two years preparing, finally leaving on April 14, 1202.<br>
<br>
As part of his effort to leave his domains in good order, Baldwin issued two notable charters for Hainaut. One detailed an extensive criminal code, and appears to be based on a now-lost charter of his father. The other laid down specific rules for inheritance. These are an important part of the legal tradition in Belgium.<br>
<br>
Baldwin left behind his two-year-old daughter and his pregnant wife, Countess Marie. By early 1204, she had left both her children behind to join him in the East. They expected to return in a couple of years, but in the end neither would see their children or their homeland again.<br>
<br>
Marie was regent for Baldwin for the two years she remained in Flanders and Hainaut. Afterward, Baldwin's younger brother Philip of Namur was regent and also had custody of the daughters. Baldwin's uncle William of Thy (an illegitimate son of Baldwin IV of Hainaut) was regent for Hainaut.<br>
<br>
Meanwhile, the crusade had been diverted to Constantinople, where the crusaders had captured and sacked the city, and decided to set up a Latin empire in place of the fallen Greek one.<br>
<br>
Latin Emperor<br>
The imperial crown was offered to, and refused by, Enrico Dandolo, Doge of Venice. The choice then lay between Baldwin and Boniface of Montferrat. Baldwin was elected on May 9, 1204, and crowned on May 16. He was young, gallant, pious, and virtuous, one of the few who interpreted and observed his crusading vows strictly; the most popular leader in the host.<br>
<br>
Baldwin's wife Marie, unaware of these events, had sailed to Acre. There she learned of her husband's election as emperor, but died of the plague in August 1204 before she could join him.<br>
<br>
The Latin Empire was organized on feudal principles; the emperor was feudal superior of the princes who received portions of the conquered territory. His own special portion consisted of the city of Constantinople, the adjacent regions both on the European and the Asiatic side, along with some outlying districts, and several islands including Lemnos, Lesbos, Chios and Tenos. The territories still had to be conquered; and first of all it was necessary to break the resistance of the Greeks in Thrace and secure Thessalonica. In this enterprise in the summer of 1204, Baldwin came into collision with Boniface of Montferrat, the rival candidate for the empire, who was to receive a large territory in Macedonia with the title of King of Salonica. He hoped to make himself quite independent of the empire, to do no homage for his kingdom, and he opposed Baldwin's proposal to march to Thessalonica. The antagonism between Flemings and Lombards aggravated the quarrel. Baldwin insisted on going to Thessalonica; Boniface laid siege to Adrianople, where Baldwin had established a governor; civil war seemed inevitable. An agreement was effected by the efforts of Dandolo and the count of Blois. Boniface received Thessalonica as a fief from the emperor, and was appointed commander of the forces which were to march to the conquest of Greece.<br>
<br>
During the following winter (1204-1205) the Franks prosecuted conquests in Bithynia, in which Henry, Baldwin's brother, took part. But in February the Greeks revolted in Thrace, relying on the assistance of John (Kaloyan), king of Bulgaria, whose overtures of alliance had been rejected by the emperor. The garrison of Adrianople was expelled. Baldwin along with Dandolo, the count of Blois, and Marshal Villehardouin, the historian, marched to besiege that city. The Bulgarian king led to its relief an army which far outnumbered that of the crusaders. The Frank knights fought desperately, but were defeated (April 14, 1205); the count of Blois was slain, and the emperor captured (see Battle of Adrianople).<br>
<br>
For some time his fate was uncertain, and in the meanwhile Henry, his brother, assumed the regency. Not till the middle of July was it definitely ascertained that he was dead. It seems that he was at first treated well as a valuable hostage, but was sacrificed by the Bulgarian monarch in a sudden outburst of rage, perhaps in consequence of the revolt of Philippopolis, which passed into the hands of the Franks. According to a Bulgarian legend, Baldwin tried to seduce Kaloyan's wife. One contemporary writer says that his hands and feet were cut off, and he was thrown into a valley where he died on the third day; but the manner of his death is not confidently known. King John himself wrote to Pope Innocent III, reporting that Baldwin had died in prison. A tower of the fortress of Veliko Turnovo is still called "Baldwin's Tower".<br>
<br>
Children and Successors<br>
It was not until July 1206 that the Latins in Constantinople had reliable information that Baldwin was dead. His brother Henry was crowned emperor in August.<br>
<br>
Back in Flanders, however, there seemed to be doubt whether Baldwin was truly dead. In any case, Baldwin's other brother Philip of Namur remained as regent, and eventually both of Baldwin's daughters Jeanne and Margaret were to rule as countesses of Flanders.<br>
</p>
Isabelle DE HAINAULT
<p>
<a name ="I007527"><b>[I007527]</b></a><br />
From Wikipedia<br>
<br>
Isabelle of Hainaut (1170 - 1190) was queen consort of France.<br>
<br>
Isabelle was born in Lille, the daughter of Baldwin V, Count of Hainaut and Countess Margaret I of Flanders. She married King Philip II of France in 1180 and brought as her dowry the county of Artois.<br>
<br>
Isabella was crowned consort of France at Saint Denis on May 28, 1180. As Baldwin V claimed to be a descendant of Charlemagne, the chroniclers of the time saw in this marriage a union of the Carolingian and Capetian dynasties. Though she received extravagant praise from certain annalists, she failed to win the affections of Philip, who, in 1184, waging war against Flanders, was angered at seeing Baldwin support his enemies, and called a council at Sens for the purpose of repudiating her. Robert, the king's uncle, successfully interposed.<br>
<br>
Isabella died in childbirth in 1190, and was buried in the cathedral of Notre Dame in Paris. Her son became Louis VIII of France.<br>
</p>
Philippa DE HAINAULT
<p>
<a name ="I008259"><b>[I008259]</b></a><br />
Philippa of Hainault (~1314 - August 15, 1369) was the Queen consort of Edward III of England.<br>
<br>
Philippa was born in Valenciennes (then in Flanders, now France) and was the daughter of William III, Count of Hainaut and Jeanne de Valois, the grandaughter of Philip III of France. She married Edward at York Minster, on October, 1327, nine months after his accession to the English throne and, unlike many of her predecessors, she did not alienate the English people by retaining her foreign retinue upon her marriage or bringing large numbers of foreigners to the English court.<br>
<br>
Philippa accompanied Edward on his expeditions to Scotland (1333) and Flanders (1338-40), where she won acclaim for her gentleness and compassion. She is also remembered by history as the tender-hearted woman, who interceded with her husband and persuaded him to spare the lives of the Burghers of Calais whom he had planned to execute as an example to the townspeople.<br>
<br>
Philippa and Edward had thirteen children, including five sons who lived into adulthood and whose rivalry would eventually bring about the long-running civil wars known as the Wars of the Roses.<br>

David DE HANMER
<p>
<a name ="I010672"><b>[I010672]</b></a><br />
Sir David Hanmer; Serjeant-at-law 1377, Judge of King's Bench 1383, knighted 1387; married Angharad, daughter of Llewelyn Ddu ("The Black") ap Gruffudd, of Bryncunallt, and died by 22 July 1387 (possibly by June 1386), having had [Jenkin Hanmer], with an eldest son (Gruffudd, whose lands were confiscated for his support of Owen Glendower 1400/1, though he was pardoned 1410), a youngest son (Philip, b 1397, d 1415) and two daughters (including Margaret, married Owen Glendower, the celebrated Welsh patriot). [Burke's Peerage]<br>
</p>
Anchetil DE HARCOURT
<p>
<a name ="I016253"><b>[I016253]</b></a><br />
Anschetil de Harcourt occurs in the Leicestershire Survey of 1124-29 as holder in Kibworth and Shagton; both porperties were possessed by English Harcouts of succeeding generations. As a resident of Leicestershire he owned in 1130 for a writ not to be impleaded of his lands or his heir. Sometime during the period 1133-48 as "Asketillus de Berges," he gave four carucates of the land of Durton to the Abbot and Convent of St Mary at Carendon, the charter being witnessed by Robert, Earl of Leicester, and Ives de Harcourt. About 1145-47 Anschetil witnessed a charter on the part of Roger, Earl of Warwick; incident to the marriage of the earl's daughter Agnes. He was dead in 1148 when his son William de Harcourt gave land in Stanton-under-Bardon to Garendon Abbey pro anima patris mei.<br>
<br>
From dates pertaining to Anschetil of Leicestershire, his sons, and his grandsons, it can be deduced that he was born about the decade 1080-1090. Hence, he was a contemporary of William, son of Robert the Strong, Seigneur of Harcourt in Normandy. This William is well known as Robert's heir and, in point of time, Anschetil could have been his brother. There is no mention of the Leicestershire Anschetil by the chroniclers of the Norman family, however, and his name has not been found in any document in which those of Robert the Strong, or his sons, occur. Possibly, Anschetil and William were first cousins - it may be speculated that Anschetil was a son of Robert's reputed borther II. vi. Ives; that he was named for I. Anschetil, father of this Ives, of Normandy; and this his own son Ives was given the name of the English Anschetil's father. The nomenclature and chronology (Anschetil of NOrmandy, probably born c 1020-1030; Ives of Normandy, probably born c 1060-1070; Anschetil of England, probably born c 1080-1090; Ives of England, probably born c 1100-10) are persuasive, but no proof can be cited.<br>
<br>
Anschetil de Harcourt of Leichestershire married Agnes, who has not been otherwise identified, and left issue: II. i. Ives. ii. William, who occurs as a witness, with Richard de Harcourt the Templar, and as Guillemus filius Ansketilli, to the confirmation of c 1126-29 by Philip de Briouze to the Abbey of St Florent; gave a third part, and leased the remainder, of Stanton-under-Bardon to Garendon Abbey in 1148, with the assent of his brother Ives and their mother Agnes; joined in 1153-54, as senescaldus meus Willelmus de Harecurt, in a notification by William de Briouze to the Priory of Sele. iii. (perhaps) Robert, tentatively identified as the witness of that name to an agreement c 1124-30 between the brothers Payn, Robert, and Elias Foliot and the Abbot of Ramsey; and as the Robertus filus Anchetilli who occurs with Bishop Philip de Harcourt in a Bayeux document of 1147. iv. (perhaps) Beatrice, married Robert Bassett. [NEHGR "The Early Harcourts"; Lundie W. Barlow, CXVI:93-94]<br>

Bernard DE HARCOURT
<p>
<a name ="I010419"><b>[I010419]</b></a><br />
He was a great Norman feudal baron. Probably he was a grandson of one of the viking chiefs of Scandinavia who accompanied Rollo about 900 A.D. in the Norse invasion of northern France where they permanently settled and gave to the country its name "Normandy". Torf possessed numerous lordships in Normandy, being Seigneur de Torville, Torcy, Torny, Torly, du Ponteautord,etc. It has been suggested that he was a son of Bernard the Dane, the most powerful of the feudal nobles of Normandy during the reign of Duke William I. (927-943) and Regent during the minority of Duke Richard I. (943-955); but this claim has not been proved.Some genealogies show his parents as Bernard of Saxony and Spriota de Bourgogne, but this is most certainly fabricated. - Todd Farmerie<br>

Rollo DE HARCOURT
<p>
<a name ="I016251"><b>[I016251]</b></a><br />
There seems to be several versions of Rollo (Robert)'s parentage. Some show his parents to be Robert de Harcourt and Colede d' Argouges. Others show Anchetil de Harcourt and Eva de Braose as parents. As far as generational dates are concerned, the most likely seems to be Anchetil de Harcourt and Eva de Braose, since Robert de Harcourt and Colede d' Argouges were contemporaries of William the Conqueror and would have been in their senior years when Rollo would have been born. Therefore, the likelihood of another generation in between is logical.<br>

Robert Guiscard DE HAUTEVILLE
<p>
<a name ="I015198"><b>[I015198]</b></a><br />
From Wikipedia<br>
<br>
Robert Guiscard (i.e. "the resourceful") (c. 1015 - 1085) was the most remarkable of the Norman adventurers who conquered Southern Italy and Sicily.<br>
<br>
From 999 to 1059 the Normans were pure mercenaries, serving either Greeks or Lombards. Then Sergius of Naples, by installing the leader Rainulf in the fortress of Aversa in 1029, gave them their first pied-à-terre, allowing them to begin an organized conquest of the land.<br>
<br>
In 1035 there arrived William Iron-Arm and Drogo, the two eldest sons of Tancred of Hauteville, a petty noble of Coutances in Normandy. The two joined in the organized attempt to wrest Apulia from the Greeks, who by 1040 had lost most of that province. In 1042 Melfi was chosen as the Norman capital, and in September of that year the Normans elected as their count William Iron-Arm, who was succeeded in turn by his brothers Drogo, "Comes Normannorum totius Apuliae e Calabriae", and Humphrey, who arrived about 1044. 1047 saw the arrival of Robert, the sixth son of Tancred of Hauteville, who was tall in stature, and had blonde colouring, blue eyes, and a powerful voice.<br>
<br>
Guiscard soon rose to distinction. The Lombards turned against their allies and Leo IX determined to expel the Norman freebooters. The army which he led towards Apulia in 1053 was, however, overthrown at Civitate on the Fortore by the Normans, united under Humfrey, Guiscard, and Richard of Aversa. In 1057 Robert succeeded Humfrey as count of Apulia and, in company with Roger, his youngest brother, carried on the conquest of Apulia and Calabria, while Richard conquered the principality of Capua.<br>
<br>
The Papacy, foreseeing the breach with the emperor over investitures, then resolved to recognize the Normans and secure them as allies. Therefore at Melfi, on August 23, 1059, Nicholas II invested Robert with Apulia, Calabria, and Sicily, and Richard with Capua. Guiscard, "by Grace of God and St Peter duke of Apulia and Calabria and future lord of Sicily", agreed to hold by annual rent of the Holy See and to maintain its cause.<br>
<br>
In the next twenty years he made an amazing series of conquests. Invading Sicily with Roger, the brothers captured Messina (1061) and Palermo (1072). Bari was reduced (April 1071), and the Greeks finally ousted from southern Italy. The territory of Salerno was already Robert's; in December 1076 he took the city, expelling its Lombard prince Gisulf, whose sister Sikelgaita he had married. The Norman attacks on Benevento, a papal fief, alarmed and angered Gregory VII, but pressed hard by the emperor, Henry IV, he turned again to the Normans, and at Ceprano (June 1080) reinvested Robert, securing him also in the southern Abruzzi, but reserving Salerno.<br>
<br>
Guiscard's last enterprise was his attack on the Greek Empire, a rallying ground for his rebel vassals. He contemplated seizing the throne of the Basileus and took up the cause of Michael VII, who had been deposed in 1078 and to whose son his daughter had been betrothed. He sailed with 16,000 men against the empire in May 1081, and by February 1082 had occupied Corfu and Durazzo, defeating the emperor Alexius before the latter (the Battle of Dyrrhachium, October 1081). He was, however, recalled to the aid of Gregory VII, besieged in San Angelo by Henry IV (June 1083).<br>
<br>
Marching north with 36,000 men he entered Rome and forced Henry to retire, but an émeute of the citizens led to a three days' sack of the city (May 1084), after which Guiscard escorted the pope to Rome. His son Bohemund, for a time master of Thessaly, had now lost the Greek conquests. Robert, returning to restore them, occupied Corfu and Kephalonia, but died of fever in the latter on July 15 1085, in his 70th year. He was buried in S. Trinità at Venosa.<br>
<br>
Guiscard was succeeded by Roger "Borsa", his son by Sikelgaita; Bohemund, his son by an earlier Norman wife Alberada, being set aside. At his death Robert was duke of Apulia and Calabria, prince of Salerno and suzerain of Sicily. His successes had been due not only to his great qualities but to the "entente" with the Papal See. He created and enforced a strong ducal power which, however, was met by many baronial revolts, one being in 1078, when he demanded from the Apulian vassals an "aid" on the betrothal of his daughter. In conquering such wide territories he had little time to organize them internally. In the history of the Norman kingdom of Italy Guiscard remains essentially the hero and founder, as his nephew Roger II is the statesman and organizer.From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia.<br>

Tancred DE HAUTEVILLE
<p>
<a name ="I007683"><b>[I007683]</b></a><br />
From Wikipedia<br>
<br>
Tancred of Hauteville was a Norman noble, about whom little is known; his historical importance comes entirely from the accomplishments of his sons and later descendants. He was a minor noble near Coutances in the Cotentin (Normandy), but it is not even certain which of the 3 villages called Hauteville he held. Various legends later arose about him which have no supporting contemporary evidence.<br>
<br>
He had 12 sons by his two wives, and several daughters, almost all of whom left Normandy for southern Italy and acquired some prominence there.<br>

By his first wife Muriel he had 5 sons:<br>
    * William Iron-Arm, count of Apulia 1042-1046 (d. 1046)<br>
    * Drogo, count of Apulia 1046-1051 (d. 1051)<br>
    * Humphrey, count of Apulia 1051-1057 (d. 1057)<br>
    * Godfrey, count of Loritello (Italy)<br>
    * Serlo (stayed in Normandy)<br>
<br>
By his second wife Fressenda (or Fredesenda) he had 7 sons and at least 1 daughter:<br>
    * Robert Guiscard, count of Apulia (1057), duke of Apulia, Calabria, and Sicily (1059-1085) (d. 1085)<br>
    * Mauger<br>
    * William, count of the Principate (d. 1080)<br>

David of Scotland, 8th Earl of Huntingdon (d. 1219) was a Scottish prince. He was the son of Henry of Scotland, 3rd Earl of Huntingdon and thereby grandson of the Scottish king David I. David's son John succeeded him to the earldom.<br>
<br>
After the extinction of the senior line of the Scottish royal house in 1290 when the line of David's brother King William I ended, David's descendants were the prime candidates for the throne. The two most notable claimants to the throne, Robert Bruce Lord of Annandale (grandfather of another Robert Bruce) and John Balliol claimed descent through David's daughters Isobel and Margaret respectively.<br>
</p>
Henry DE HUNTINGDON
<p>
<a name ="I006360"><b>[I006360]</b></a><br />
Henry of Scotland, 3rd Earl of Huntingdon (1114-1152) was a Scottish prince and English peer. He was the son of King David I and Maud, 2nd Countess of Huntingdon, and was named after his uncle, King Henry I of England. He had three sons, two of whom became King of Scotland, and a third whose descendents were to prove critical in the later days of the Scottish royal house.<br>
<br>
Henry married Ada de Warenne, the daughter of William de Warenne, 2nd Earl of Surrey, and Isabella de Vermandois. Their children were:<br>
   1. Malcolm (1141-1165)<br>
   2. William (1143-1213)<br>
   3. David (1144-1219)<br>
   4. Ada of Huntingdon, married Floris III, Count of Holland<br>
   5. Margaret of Huntingdon, married (1) Conan IV, Duke of Brittany; (2) Humphrey de Bohun<br>
<br>
His eldest son became King of Scotland as Malcolm IV in 1153. Henry's second son became king in 1165 on the death of his brother, reigning as William I. Both in their turn inherited the title of Earl of Huntingdon. His third son, David also became Earl of Huntingdon. It is from the 8th Earl that all Kings of Scotland after Margaret, Maid of Norway claim descent.<br>
<br>
On Henry's death his title passed to his half-brother Simon of St Liz.<br>
