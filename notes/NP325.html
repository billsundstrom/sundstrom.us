Cass earned a BS at the University of Nebraska at Lincoln, attended graduate school at the Connecticut Center for Message Therapy, and is a Licensed Massage Therapist. O'Donovan identifies as a Caucasian, lower-middle-class lesbian and as a Christian in the United Church of Christ.<br>
Abstract<br>
In this oral history, O'Donovan tells about her family and parental background in New England in the 1950s and 60s. She recalls leading a happy childhood as a tomboy fascinated with outdoor sports, bicycles, horses TV, Girl Scouts and reading books and refers to her early, independent interest in religion and church. The interview includes a wide range of her interests, and traces a trajectory from college to seminary during the 1970s. She talks about shifts from Southern Baptist to Roman Catholic and finally to United Church of Christ and Congregational Church denominations. O'Donovan reflects on her sexual identity, her relationship with her partner, Cass, and outlines the dynamics of her divorce, as she left her husband to raise three kids with Cass. She discusses historically significant ordination as the first openly gay women ordained by the Episcopal Church in Connecticut in 1980 and the hardships and victories of her church life, including struggles with discrimination as well as acceptance in her churches. Through pastoral leadership and membership in the United Church Coalition for Lesbian/Gay Concerns, O'Donovan utilized her self-identity as a "justice pastor" to further an understanding of lesbian and gay issues in her congregations through a lens of faith.<br>
