Betty was born on July 5, 1919, in Jacksonville, Florida, to parents Mary Pearl Pelton Baird of Somerset, Kentucky, and Fred John Baird of Warwick, New York, who instilled a lifelong love of traveling in Betty. The family traveled extensively throughout North America. Betty graduated from Georgia State College in Douglas, where she received a degree in Home Economics. Near the end of World War II, Betty married the love of her life, Les Herring , a lieutenant commander in the Navy at Guantanamo, Cuba, stationed out of Jacksonville, who was her brother's best friend. They married on one of his leaves. After his service, they made their home in Jacksonville briefly, and then Miami, Florida. These were very happy, through sometimes lean years, raising a family and enjoying beautiful Miami. Betty sold Avon products for 25 years, using her earnings to pay for the family's many wonderful vacations. Les and Betty eventually retired and moved to Port St. Lucie and then to Ft. Pierce. She and Les started the Orchid Society and the Bottle Club in Port St. Lucie. Les's keen interest in geology and ancient ruins took them to Mexico, Peru, Guatemala, and to many locations in the American Southwest. They also traveled to Cuba, Jamaica, Costa Rica, Panama, and Europe and to Betty's favorite place of all, Hawaii. Betty had many artistic talents. She painted, made pottery, and shell art which she enjoyed selling at craft shows. Betty was a great wife and mother, very social, talkative, independent, and spunky all her life. She will be remembered by all as a genuine Character with a capital C. She will be missed by all who knew her. A celebration of her life will take place in Lakeland at a yet to be determined time. Her final resting place will be at Florida National Cemetery, in Bushnell, Florida, next to her husband. In lieu of flowers, please consider supporting your local public television station, which she loved.<br>
