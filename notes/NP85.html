Lucius Eugene CHITTENDEN
<p>
<a name ="I098040"><b>[I098040]</b></a><br />
Lucius Eugene Chittenden (May 24, 1824 - July 22, 1900) was a Vermont author, banker, lawyer, politician and peace advocate who served as Register of the Treasury during the Lincoln administration.<br>
Chittenden was born in Williston, Vermont, the son of Giles and Betsey (Hollenbeck) Chittenden. He was the 2nd-great-grandson of Vermont's first governor, Thomas Chittenden. He received his early education in the district schools of Williston and academies in Williston, Hinesburg and Cambridge. He studied law with a variety of attorneys, and was admitted to the bar in Franklin County in 1844. He opened a law office in Burlington the next year.<br>
He became interested in politics and public affairs early in his career, gained prominence in the anti-slavery movement and the Free Soil Party, and published from 1848 to 1851, with E. A. Stansbury, the "Free Soil Courier." After helping Democrat John S. Robinson get elected governor in 1852, he became active in the newly formed Republican Party. He was elected state senator from Chittenden County, and served from 1856 to 1860, while also serving as president of the Commercial Bank in Burlington.<br>
Governor Erastus Fairbanks, in February 1861, appointed Chittenden one of five Vermont delegates to the Washington Peace Conference, a group formed to try avert the coming Civil War. The other delegates were former Governor Hiland Hall, Levi Underwood, H. Henry Baxter, and B. D. Harris. Chittenden was selected recorder of the conference, and published its records in 1864.<br>
In March 1861, President Lincoln's new Secretary of the Treasury, Salmon P. Chase, a former member of the defunct Free Soil Party, offered Chittenden the position of Register of the U.S. Treasury, which he accepted, serving in that office for the remainder of Lincoln's first administration, resigning in 1864 due to poor health.<br>
When he resigned from the Lincoln Administration, he returned to Vermont to regain his health, but in 1867 moved to New York City, where he practiced as an attorney until at least 1894. He returned to Burlington at some point, where he died.<br>
Chittenden was married to Mary Hatch in 1856, and fathered three children. (Horace, Mary and Bessie.)<br>

Marilyn CHRISTENSEN
<p>
<a name ="I042665"><b>[I042665]</b></a><br />
Leslie Marilyn NEGROPONTES, <br>
July 29, 1942 - Vulcan, AB to February 19, 2014 - Calgary, AB<br>
Playful. Generous. Intelligent. Courageous. Voice-of-reason. Remarkable. Elegant. Gracious. Beautiful. Steadfast friend. Adventurous traveler. Savvy business woman. Culinary magician. Costume designer. Resilient leader. Comforter... these are just a few of the words used to describe Marilyn. Leslie "Marilyn" Negropontes died peacefully at home on Wednesday, February 19, 2014, from breast cancer at the age of 71 years. Predeceased by both parents, sister Nancy, and grandson Eli, Marilyn is survived by her husband Sandy, daughter Mary and her husband Rod, son Evan, daughter Jessie, granddaughters Emma and Annika, sister Judy and brother Keith and their families, her first husband Chris, and countless loving relatives and devoted friends. She touched the lives of many people and will be greatly missed. Born July 29, 1942, in Vulcan, Alberta, to Les and Kaye (nee Craig) Christensen, Marilyn spent the first part of her life in and around the town of Champion. That is where she learned to love the big blue sky of the prairie. The oldest of four siblings and many first cousins, she was a natural leader. After a short time at the University of Alberta, she moved to Calgary where she married Chris Dann in 1962. Mary Kathleen and Christopher "Evan" were born soon thereafter. Marilyn married her second husband, Alexander "Sandy" in 1971, and gave birth to her third child, Jessica Alexandra a few years later. Marilyn had several careers, in the corporate world. In addition to these she ran her own business with her sisters Judy and Nancy for several years. She was a generous volunteer, donating her time and skills to fellow cancer- patients in the Hope Group and Hospice Calgary, children with disabilities and their families at the Calgary Between Friends Club, and many circles of friends including book club, investment club, and the Pembina Hall friends group. She never called herself an artist, but her creative instincts and stylish flair was noticed in everything she touched, from photography to food to interior decorating. She had a passion for textiles, and lovingly created clothing and gifts for many special occasions. Marilyn's deep love of travel and nature took her around the world. Among other great destinations, she visited mountain tops in the Rockies and toured India with the "Eight Canadian Mothers", immersed herself in family history in Nova Scotia with Jessie, cruised the Mediterranean with Judy and Mary, traveled in the eastern US with Evan, explored Europe, Africa and South America with Sandy. Following Marilyn's wishes, there will be a private family service in early March. Any others who wish to remember Marilyn are invited to do something creative or generous in her honor; in that way, many sparks of beauty and goodness will be sent out into the world and we will all be a little bit better-off because she was here. Condolences may be forwarded through www.mcinnisandholloway.com. In living memory of Marilyn Negropontes, a tree will be planted at Big Hill Springs Park, Cochrane.<br>
