September 30, 1939 - March 14, 2012 <br>
Leona Heaton Merrill, although limited by her health in recent years, the garden was her favorite place to be. As a child on a farm in southern Utah, it was in her nature to nurture and love lambs, baby rabbits, chicks, calves, piglets, and ducklings. She developed a special relationship with a white fluffy lamb she called Jimmy. At one point Leona took ill, her brother Burke Heaton , and four sisters Elaine Hoyt, Dorothy Phillips, Nanell Mann, Gladys Walker, and little Jimmy vigilantly remained just outside her bedroom window until she was well. She developed a special yearning for red delicious apples. Because she often enjoyed that crisp, country delicacy she was nicknamed Licious after the namesake of her favorite apple. She married Reed Merrill in March of 1961 and graduated from Utah State University in May 1961. Leona taught elementary school in Ogden, Perry, Orem and Salt Lake Districts. She served an LDS Mission with her husband in Birmingham, Alabama, 2005-2006, as a CES Missionary. Leona 's loving husband Reed, five children Harry, George, Dylan, Allison, Mitchell and thirteen grandchildren all think the world of her. Every time we see a baby farm animal or bite into a red delicious apple our hearts will be with her. <br>

Mabel Evelena Stagnaro passed away in her sleep at home on Sunday, October 12, 2008, having recently celebrated her 90th birthday. Mabel was born in Zelzah, California which was later renamed Northridge. Her family moved to Tracy just a few months before the stock market crash and start of the great depression in 1929. After graduating from Tracy High, Mabel moved to San Francisco to attend nursing school. She would tell stories of life in "The City" during World War II with mandatory blackouts and gas rationing. As a young woman, the adventurous Mabel traveled alone across the United States and Canada. Seeking more adventure, she learned to fly at a time when few women held a pilot's certificate. Mabel was one of the founding members of the Stockton 99's, an international women's flying organization founded by Amelia Earhart. She was also a member of the Women Flyers of America. Her passion for flying led to her work in helping bring the Blue Angels to Stockton for their first air show here. On November 25, 1950, she married Henry Stagnaro and together they raised five children: Stephen (Jennifer) Stagnaro of Boulder Creek, California; Christopher (Stacey) Stagnaro of Honolulu, Hawaii; James (Pennie) Stagnaro of Rawlins, Wyoming; David (Veronica) Stagnaro of Linden, California and Jeannine (Mark) Peterson of Stockton. As she approached her 90th year she was able to see her eleventh grandchild born. She was the loving grandmother of Darren, Kyle, Wynne, Angelo, Eric, Melissa, Chris, Gianna, Aaron, Kevin, and Becky. Even with the demands of raising four sons and a daughter, Mabel was an active member of numerous civic organizations including; the Stockton and Linden Garden Clubs, Philomathean Club, San Joaquin County Historical Society, Haggin Museum, Society of California Pioneers, and Waverly 4-H. Mabel will be remembered for her positive attitude toward life, courage in the face of adversity, and love of her husband, children and grandchildren.<br>
