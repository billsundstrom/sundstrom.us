Mr. and Mrs. Gordon L. Vetter, who were married recently, are now at home In Manhattan, Kan., at 1512 Pierre Street. The bride is the former Miss Linda Ann Myers, daughter of Mr. and Mrs. Harold L. Myers of Loveland, and the groom is the son of Mr. and Mrs. Lee J. Vetter of Fort Lupton, former residents of Eaton. <br>
The wedding was solemnized at 7 o'clock in the evening in the new First Methodist church of Love- land. The Rev. A. E. Plummer officiated at the double ring candle light ceremony in the presence of 150 guests. In addition to Loveland friends and relatives, guests came from Illinois, Nevada, Cripple Creek, Fort Collins, and Fort Lupton Greeley for the wedding. Two large baskets of white carnations and snapdragons, and potted ferns formed the floral set. White tapers burned in seven branched candelabra, which were decorated with lemon leaves and white satin bows. Incidental organ music was played while the guests assembled by Mrs. Porte Glassgow, who was the bride's music instructor. The candles were lighted by Miss Betty Lou Louck of Denver and Miss Jonna Askey o Loveland. Their formal gowns were of lavender net and taffeta, ballerina length. They wore headbands of white shattered carnation and rosebuds. Wedding selections, sung by Miss Ashley were, My Wonderful On and I Love You Truly. As the couple knelt at the altar for the minister's final blessing the groom's father sang The Lord's prayer. Mrs. Glassgow accompanied the soloists and played the traditional wedding marches. The bride, entering on the arm of her father, who gave her In mar age, was lovely in a gown of white milk shantung, designed with a boat shaped neckline, edged with seed earls, fitted bodice and full skirt waltz length. She wore matching bow-length mitts and carried the Rainbow Bible on which rested a lavender throated whit orchid. From it cascaded streamers of white satin ribbons, tied in love knots with lily of the valley. Her brunette beauty was enhanced by a seed pearl crown from which fell a fingertip veil of bridal illusion. Her only jewelry was a single strand of pearls, gift of the groom, and an heirloom ring of a blue sapphire surrounded by pearls, belonging to her grandmother Myers. She was attended by Miss Moira Brownfield of Denver as maid of honor whose ballerina-length frock of light blue silk shantung was fashioned with a button-down-the- front bodice and full skirt with un- pressed pleats. Matching gloves and slippers completed her ensemble. She carried a bouquet of red . <br>
