Lora Jean MILLER
<p>
<a name ="I082128"><b>[I082128]</b></a><br />
Jean Smith , born Lora Jean Miller on June 21, 1923, passed away in Richland, WA, on December 11, 2006. She was born in Thedford, NE, to Logan and Della Miller. Jean grew up and graduated from high school in Lincoln, NE. She was working for the phone company, in Lincoln, when she and Mary Kay Clark, nee Baker, heard of higher paying jobs at the Hanford Engineer Works in Richland.<br>
In June of 1944, the two arrived at Hanford and Jean went to work in the bank, living in the women's barracks, then the women's dorm and then a prefab with friends. During that time she met a tall, handsome engineer and on August 12, 1950, she became Mrs. Howard C. Smith . Two years later, she became the mother of a daughter, moved into an "F" house and set up a household. A son was born 18 months later and the Smith family was complete. Jean spent the next 15 years raising children, keeping house and playing bridge. She was also very creative and developed expertise in knitting, sewing, cross-stitch and other crafts. And then there were all of her roses!<br>
As the children grew older, she decided to return to work. She started out part-time in an ophthalmologist's and then went to work for the Department of Energy in the Federal Building. There she spent the next 10 years as a secretary for members of upper management, completing her career as secretary to the manager of the DOE, Richland Operations. She was loved and respected for her professionalism, knowledge and care.<br>
Jean and Howard enjoyed their retirement supporting local sports teams and visiting their children as they moved about the country. They both were active members of All Saint's Episcopal Church in Richland. Jean sang in the choir and was church secretary. When the Columbia Basin Racquet Club opened, both Jean and Howard became avid members. Jean was their first "Aerobicizer of the Year" when she was in her early 60's and continued working out on weights and machines with personal trainers until she was almost 80.<br>
Jean became a caregiver to her husband as his health faltered, so it wasn't until 1998 that she was diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease. She had been showing symptoms for three of four years before but wouldn't slow down long enough to find out about it. After Howard died in 1998, Jean continued to enjoy her love of music and travel, attending many local cultural events and traveling to Las Vegas, LA, New York City and Europe. When her Alzheimer's got to be too much for her, she moved into Guardian Angel Homes, in Richland. She spent the last 2 1/2 years of her life there, enjoying good times, good friends and good care.<br>
Jean Smith will be remembered as a "class act." She made her own happiness, no matter the situation, and was always there to help others. She is survived by her son, Chad (Seattle); daughter, Kendal (Richland); and sister Ardeen Darnell and family (Greeley, CO.)<br>
