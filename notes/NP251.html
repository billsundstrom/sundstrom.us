Cousin Domenico was a brother of Quentin and Frankie. He also served in the Army, he volunteered in WWII and made a career of the service. When he retired he was a LT. Colonel. Domenico was the geneologist of the family and I am sorry that I did not get more information from him when I could. Domenico served not only in WWII but in Korea - 3 tours. He was a hero in Korea for saving all the men under his command by telling them to lie down in a field of dead soldiers and pretend to be dead also. He saved the life of many men, including himself. He was a wonderful, friendly and intelligent man. I miss his yearly visits. He lived in Mass. when he retired.<br>
