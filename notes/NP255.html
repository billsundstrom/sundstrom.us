<h2>Notes</h2>
Constance HOPKINS
<p>
<a name ="I006100"><b>[I006100]</b></a><br />
Constance Hopkins was baptized on 11 May 1606 in Hursley, Hampshire, England, to parents Stephen Hopkins and his first wife Mary.  It should be noted that the long-standing Constance Dudley myth was disproven in 1998: the Hopkins family of the Mayflower was not from Wortley, Gloucester as had been previously speculated and published.<br>
<br>
Constance came with her father Stephen, step-mother Elizabeth, brother Giles, and step-sister Damaris on the Mayflower in 1620, at the age of 14.  Constance's future husband, Nicholas Snow, arrived on the ship Anne in 1623.  Nicholas and Constance Snow were married shortly before the 1627 Division of Cattle, and lived in Plymouth for a time.  Around 1645, the family moved to Eastham.<br>
<br>
William Bradford, writing in 1651, stated that Constance Hopkins had 12 children "all of them living".  Only 9 can be documented with existing records.  Constance, wife of Daniel Doane, is quite probably one of the three "missing" children, but unfortunately there is no conclusive proof.<br>

<a name ="I005655"><b>[I005655]</b></a><br />
Giles Hopkins was baptized on 30 January 1607/8 in Hursley, Hampshire, England, to parents Stephen Hopkins and his first wife Mary.  It should be noted that the long-standing Constance Dudley myth was disproven in 1998: the Hopkins family of the Mayflower was not from Wortley, Gloucester as had been previously speculated and published.<br>
<br>
Giles came with his father Stephen, step-mother Elizabeth, sister Constance, and step-sister Damaris on the Mayflower in 1620, at the age of 12.  He volunteered for service in the 1637 Pequot War but was not called.  He married Catherine Wheldon in 1639 at Plymouth; the family moved shortly thereafter to Yarmouth, living there for about five years before moving on to settle at Eastham, where he died sometime between 1688 and 1690.<br>
</p>
Stephen HOPKINS
<p>
<a name ="I005657"><b>[I005657]</b></a><br />
Stephen Hopkins was from Hampshire, England.  He married his first wife, Mary, and in the parish of Hursley, Hampshire; he and wife Mary had their children Elizabeth, Constance, and Giles all baptized there.  It has long been claimed that the Hopkins family was from Wortley, Gloucester, but this was disproven in 1998.  For more information on the true English origins of Stephen Hopkins, see the "Published Research" section at the bottom of this page.<br>
<br>
Stephen Hopkins went with the ship Sea Venture on a voyage to Jamestown, Virginia in 1609 as a minister's clerk, but the ship wrecked in the "Isle of Devils" in the Bermudas.  Stranded on an island for ten months, the passengers and crew survived on turtles, birds, and wild pigs.  Six months into the castaway, Stephen Hopkins and several others organized a mutiny against the current governor.  The mutiny was discovered and Stephen was sentenced to death.  However, he pleaded with sorrow and tears.  "So penitent he was, and made so much moan, alleging the ruin of his wife and children in this his trespass, as it wrought in the hearts of all the better sorts of the company".  He managed to get his sentence commuted.<br>
<br>
Eventually the castaways built a small ship and sailed themselves to Jamestown.  How long Stephen remained in Jamestown is not known. However, while he was gone, his wife Mary died.  She was buried in Hursley on 9 May 1613, and left behind a probate estate which mentions her children Elizabeth, Constance and Giles.<br>
<br>
Stephen was back in England by 1617, when he married Elizabeth Fisher, but apparently had every intention of bringing his family back to Virginia.  Their first child, Damaris, was born about 1618.  In 1620, Stephen Hopkins brought his wife, and children Constance, Giles, and Damaris on the Mayflower (child Elizabeth apparently had died).  Stephen was a fairly active member of the Pilgrims shortly after arrival, perhaps a result of his being one of the few individuals who had been to Virginia previously.  He was a part of all the early exploring missions, and was used almost as an "expert" on Native Americans for the first few contacts.  While out exploring, Stephen recognized and identified an Indian deer trap.  And when Samoset walked into Plymouth and welcomed the English, he was housed in Stephen Hopkins' house for the night.  Stephen was also sent on several of the ambassadorial missions to meet with the various Indian groups in the region.<br>
<br>
Stephen was an assistant to the governor through 1636, and volunteered for the Pequot War of 1637 but was never called to serve.  By the late 1630s, however, Stephen began to occasionally run afoul of the Plymouth authorities, as he apparently opened up a shop and served alcohol.  In 1636 he got into a fight with John Tisdale and seriously wounded him.  In 1637, he was fined for allowing drinking and shuffleboard playing on Sunday.  Early the next year he was fined for allowing people to drink excessively in his house: guest William Reynolds was fined, but the others were acquitted.  In 1638 he was twice fined for selling beer at twice the actual value, and in 1639 he was fined for selling a looking glass for twice what it would cost if bought in the Bay Colony.  Also in 1638, Stephen Hopkins' maidservant got pregnant from Arthur Peach, who was subsequently executed for murdering an Indian.  The Plymouth Court ruled he was financially responsible for her and her child for the next two years (the amount remaining on her term of service).  Stephen, in contempt of court, threw Dorothy out of his household and refused to provide for her, so the court committed him to custody.  John Holmes stepped in and purchased Dorothy's remaining two years of service from him: agreeing to support her and child.<br>
<br>
Stephen died in 1644, and made out a will, asking to be buried near his wife, and naming his surviving children.<br>

Jean Horner Melin, age 95, of Osage, died on Thursday, June 20, 2002, at the Faith Lutheran Home in Osage.<br>
Graveside inurnment services were held at 1:30 p.m., on Wednesday, June 26, in the Oak Grove Cemetery in Mitchell. Reverent Jerry Newland officiated. There was no visitation.<br>
Jean Horner Melin, was born on March 9, 1907 in Charles City, to Daniel and Beulah (Cole) Horner. She spent her first nine and one-half years in the Mitchell School and graduated from the Osage High School in 1925. She attended Iowa State Teachers College in Cedar Falls from 1926 to 1928.<br>
Melin was in the first contingent to go to the first WAAC training center at Ft. Des Moines. As a new officer she spent time in New York City and New Jersey recruiting. In January, she and 15 other WAAC's were selected to go to the Command and General Staff School in Ft. Leavenworth, Kansas. Fifteen women were first lieutenants, the 16th, a captain. Never in the history of the school had any male officer qualified under the grade of major and never before had women attended, thereby breaking Army tradition. Jean spent time in the Pentagon selecting women for various assignments, both stateside and overseas. In September she was taken into the regular Army. The WAAC was an auxiliary to the Army, the second "A" was eliminated. The WAC became "The Women's Army Corps." At that time she was promoted to Captain and subsequently assigned to the Army ground forces replacement school command in Birmingham, Alabama, where she was the staff director reporting to the commanding general on women's affairs. Twelve detachments of women across the lower half of the United States replaced men for active duty. She was promoted to major in 1944.<br>
After 22 months in Birmingham she was assigned to Purdue University at West Lafayette, Indiana, to assist in establishing a school for WAC officers. At the end of WW II she returned to civilian status and worked in the War Assets Administration and in the Pentagon only to be recalled to service as staff director of WAC's in the First Service Command at Governor's Island, New York. She left the Army for the second time in 1948. Later she worked on government contracts for various companies in Buffalo, New York, Phoenix, Arizona and Los Angeles, California. Prior to the military, Jean worked in Davenport and Chicago, Illinois. She moved back to Iowa in 1990.<br>
Jean was preceded in death by her parents; and one sister, Josephine Schmarzo.<br>
Survivors include two nephews, Gordon Schmarzo and his wife, Donna of Manning and Kenneth Schmarzo of Charles City.<br>
