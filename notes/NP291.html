</p>
Aethelbert I of KENT
<p>
<a name ="I015320"><b>[I015320]</b></a><br />
Ethelbert (or Æthelbert, or Aethelberht) (c. 552 - February 24, 6161) was King of Kent from around 580 or 590 until his death. After his death, he was regarded as a saint.<br>
<br>
He was the son of Eormenric, whom he succeeded as king, according to the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle. Gregory of Tours, who was a close acquaintance of Queen Ingoberg (the mother of Ethelbert's wife Berthe), twice calls him simply "a man of Kent", indicating that he was not king at the time Gregory's History of the Franks was written, and that Ethelbert more likely became king closer to 590.<br>
<br>
The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle records that he attempted at one stage to wrest the position of Bretwalda from Ceawlin of Wessex but was unsuccessful. His standing was advanced by his marriage with Berthe, daughter of Charibert, king of the Franks, thus building an alliance with the most powerful state in Europe at that time. This prestige enabled him to claim the title of Bretwalda after Ceawlin's death.<br>
<br>
The influence of Berthe, who had brought her chaplain Liuhard (or Letard) with her to Kent, may have led to the invitation to Pope Gregory I to send missionaries from Rome. Augustine landed on the Isle of Thanet in 597, and Ethelbert first met him under an oak tree, in accordance with his belief that he could thus dispel any magic the Christians might attempt. Tradition has it that Augustine baptized Ethelbert only a few days after landing in Kent, although a letter from Gregory to Berthe suggests that it cannot have happened before 601. In any case, churches were established and efforts began to convert the people to Christianity.<br>
<br>
Ethelbert also established a written code of laws for Kent, the earliest in any Anglo-Saxon kingdom, which provided for the protection of the Church and instituted a complex system of fines. The nature of the law code is evidence that Kent was a relatively organized and centralized kingdom under Ethelbert.<br>
<br>
Ethelbert was later canonised for his role in restoring Christianity to England. Although he died on February 24, 616, his feast day was usually celebrated on February 25 so that it would not overlap with the feast of Saint Matthias on the previous day.<br>
</p>
Aethelbert II of KENT
<p>
<a name ="I005217"><b>[I005217]</b></a><br />
Aethelbert II (c.732 - 760 or 762) was king of Kent from ? - 760 or 762. Upon the death of his father Wihtred, the kingdom was divided among his three sons, Aethelbert, Egbert and Alric, with Aethelred as overking. He outlived both of his brothers and there is mention of another king ruling jointly with Aethelred. Little is known about Aethelred during his reign, except that he caused the burning of Canterbury.<br>
</p>
Eadbald of KENT
<p>
<a name ="I015317"><b>[I015317]</b></a><br />
Eadbald (died January 20, 640) was the King of Kent from 616 until his death.<br>
<br>
He succeeded his father Æthelbert as king. At first, Eadbald renounced his baptism, rejected Christianity, and married his father's widow. He was later converted by Laurence of Canterbury, recalled Mellitus and Justus, and built a church at Canterbury. (However, the historian D. P. Kirby argued that Bede's account is confused, and that Eadbald was more likely to have been converted by Justus.)<br>
<br>
He also arranged a marriage between his sister Æthelberg and Edwin of Northumbria, later taking her and Paulinus back when Edwin died in 633.<br>
<br>
Eadbald married the Frankish princess Emma, daughter of Theudebert II of Austrasia, possibly in 624, and they had a son called Eorcenberht, who succeeded Eadbald as king.<br>
</p>
Ealhmund of KENT
<p>
<a name ="I005178"><b>[I005178]</b></a><br />
From Wikipedia<br>
<br>
Ealhmund (d. 785?), also known as Alckmund of Wessex, was a King of Kent (c. 784 - c. 785). The 784 entry of the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle mentions Ealhmund as the father of Egbert, but this is uncertain.<br>
<br>
Ealhmund probably became king following the death of Egbert II around the year 784. There is little historical evidence for his reign. A charter of 784 survives, in which Ealhmund granted land to the Abbot of Reculver. Significantly, this charter makes no mention of Offa of Mercia, who had ruled Kent directly or indirectly for most of the 760s and 770s; we may consider this as evidence that Ealhmund was acting independent of Offa's authority, perhaps as a consequence of a possible Kentish victory at the Battle of Otford in 776.<br>
<br>
If this was the case, however, it did not last: Offa invaded Kent again around the year 785 and Ealhmund was probably killed in battle. After this, Offa ruled Kent directly.<br>
</p>
Ecgberht of KENT
<p>
<a name ="I015313"><b>[I015313]</b></a><br />
Ecgberht, or Egbert (d. July 4, 673) was a King of Kent who ruled from 664 to 673, succeeding his father Eorcenberht.<br>
<br>
He may have still been a child when he became king following his father's death on July 14, 664, because his mother Seaxburh was recorded as having been regent.<br>
<br>
Ecgberht's court seems to have had many diplomatic and ecclesiastic contacts. He hosted Wilfrid and Benedict Biscop, and provided escorts to Theodore and Hadrian for their travels in Gaul.<br>
<br>
The Mildrith legend reports that he had his cousins Aethelred and Aethelberht (sons of his uncle Eormenred) killed; this may reflect a dynastic struggle that ended in the success of Eorcenberht's line.<br>
<br>
A charter records his patronage of the monastery at Chertsey.<br>
<br>
Ecgberht was succeeded by his brother Hlothhere, who was in turn succeeded by Ecgberht's son Eadric and still later by his other son Wihtred.<br>
</p>
Eorcenberht of KENT
<p>
<a name ="I015315"><b>[I015315]</b></a><br />
Eorcenberht (died 14 July 664) was king of the Anglo-Saxon kingdom of Kent from 640 to 664, succeeding his father Eadbald.<br>
<br>
The Mildrith legend suggests that he was the younger son of Eadbald, and that his older brother Eormenred was deliberately passed over, although another possibility is that they ruled jointly.<br>
<br>
According to Bede (HE III.8), Eorcenberht was the first king in Britain to command that pagan idols be destroyed and that Lent be observed. After the death of Honorius, the Archbishop of Canterbury, Eorcenberht appointed the first Saxon archbishop, Deusdedit, in 655.<br>
<br>
Eorcenberht married Seaxburh, daughter of king Anna of East Anglia, and their daughter Eorcengota became a nun at the abbey of Faremoutiers-en-Brie on the continent.<br>
<br>
Eorcenberht was succeeded by his son Ecgberht.<br>

Gina Kay KENT
<p>
<a name ="I080063"><b>[I080063]</b></a><br />
Hurley, Gina Kay, 50, of Irvine CA, with her husband, Mike at her side, personally met our Lord and Savior on May 6th, 2010. Born October 4, 1959 in Fredrick, OK. to Joe and Linda Kent, Gina graduated from Blanch Thomas High school in Sentinel, OK. She then went on to CPRF Computer Programming School in Wichita, KS. Following graduation, Gina moved to Phoenix, AZ. and it was there she met the love of her life, Mike Hurley. Gina and Mike moved to San Diego in February of 1989 while finally settling in Irvine, CA. April of 1996. Gina will be remembered not only for her beautiful smile, but in the gracious way she treated others. As an office/property manager and executive assistant for a very demanding bossher husband, no project was too challenging. Blessed with many passions, Gina enjoyed gardening, traveling, decorating and shopping. But her favorites were simply taking care of Mike, and her "baby" T.O. and rediscovering her Faith in our Lord Jesus Christ. Gina left this earth too soon for family and friends, we weren't quite ready. But Gina was, and to be reunited with others in heaven in the presence of our Lord, made it the right time. Her courageous battle with ovarian cancer did not cause her faith to waiver, but empowered it beyond belief. Our memories of Gina will last forever, and to those that knew her, her faith, hope and love will forever be our guide. Gina is preceded in death by her parents and grandparents. She is survived by her husband, Mike of 22 years; two sisters, Jolyna Abernathy (Randy), Lisa Proffitt (Monty), all of Cordell, OK.; sisters-in-law, Megan Clayberg (Brett) of Pella, IA, Colleen Hurtado (Bob) of Omaha, NE.; brothers-in-law, Tim Hurley (Laura) Grand Island, NE, Kevin Hurley (Sharon) Rocklin, CA, Joe Hurley (Sue), Dan Hurley, Jeff Hurley (Molly), Matt Hurley (Mary Ellen), all of Omaha, NE.; numerous nieces, nephews who loved her tables and chairs, to infinity and beyond. LYM. In lieu of flowers, the family suggests memorials to Mike Hurley, be redirected in Gina's name to some of her favorite causes; Ovarian Cancer Research Fund, Orange County Rescue Mission and Orange County Humane Society. Funeral services, May 12th, 2010, 11:00 a.m., Tustin Church of Christ, 16481 East Main St, Tustin, CA 92780-4031. <br>

</p>
Oisc of KENT
<p>
<a name ="I015325"><b>[I015325]</b></a><br />
Oisc (alternately Oeric or Aesc) was an early King of Kent who ruled from about 488 to about 516.<br>
<br>
Little is known about him, and the information that does survive regarding his life is often vague and suspect. He seems to have been the son or the grandson of Hengest, who led the initial Jutish conquest and settlement of Kent. Oisc was evidently regarded by later generations as having been the founder of the kingdom or of the royal line, since his descendants called themselves "Oiscingas" after him.<br>
<br>
He was said to have been a leader of the Anglo-Saxons at the Battle of Mons Badonicus, in which they were defeated by the native Britons. In fact, he was the only one of their kings whose participation in this battle was recorded.<br>

</p>
Wihtred of KENT
<p>
<a name ="I015312"><b>[I015312]</b></a><br />
Wihtred (died April 23, 725) was a King of Kent (690 - 725). He was a son of Ecgberht and a brother of Eadric.<br>
<br>
He became king during the period of disorder in Kent that followed the invasion of Caedwalla of Wessex. Oswine, a king who had been supported by Mercia, lost power in 690, but the East Saxon Swafred (son of Sebbi, the king of Essex), who had been a king in Kent for a year or two, remained. Wihtred emerged and became king late in 690, apparently ruling alongside Swefred. Swefred maintained his position until at least 692, but by 694 Wihtred was the sole ruler of Kent.<br>
<br>
It was also in 694 that Wihtred made peace with the West Saxon king Ine, which he achieved by paying compensation for the killing of Caedwalla's brother, Mul, in 687. Wihtred produced a law code for Kent, which was notable for its generosity toward the Church, which was granted freedom from taxation.<br>
<br>
On his death, he left Kent to three different sons: Aethelbert, Eadbert, and Alric.<br>
