After graduating from the School of Mines with a Civil Engineering degree in December 1982 I spent a semester working on my master's degree in the spring of 1983. I finally went back and finished the degree in 2007 (only took 24 years).<br>
I worked for WyDOT and various consulting firms before I landed a job with the US Army Corps of Engineers in 1986 and have been with them ever since. I'm currently a program manager handling O&M projects at the Air Force and Army bases in Nebraska, the Dakotas, Wyoming and Colorado as well as being the Corps water resources technical manager for water resource projects in Afghanistan.<br>

Brynhild BUDLASDATTER
<p>
<a name ="I008192"><b>[I008192]</b></a><br />
n Norse mythology, Brynhildr (German: Brünnehilde) was a shieldmaiden and a valkyrie. According to the Volsungasaga, she is the daughter of Budli and brother of Atli (Attila the Hun). She was ordered to decide a fight in between two kings, Hjalmgunnar and Agnar. The valkyrie knew that Odin himself preferred the older king, Hjalmgunnar, yet Brynhild decided the battle for Agnar. For this Odin condemned the valkyrie to live the life of a mortal woman and cursed her to sleep until any man would rescue and marry her. Brynhild was imprisoned in a ring of fire that only the greatest hero could enter. Sigurd (Siegfried), the son of Sigmund, entered that ring after killing the dragon Fafnir and awoke Brynhild. Later Sigurd gave her his ring, Andvarinaut.<br>
<br>
Sigurd duly betrayed her and married Gudrun when bewitched by the sorceress Grimhild to forget Brynhild. Gudrun's brother, Gunnar, then sought to court Brynhild but was stopped by the ring of fire that still surrounded her. Sigurd exchanged shapes with him and entered the ring of fire a second time. He then took the ring Andvarinaut from her finger and gave it to Gudrun. Gunnar and Brynhild married, but she realised Sigurd's betrayal when she saw Gudrun wearing the Andvarinaut and then plotted to have him killed. Her brother-in-law Guttorm killed Sigurd, Brynhild herself killed Sigurd's three-year-old son, and then she willed herself to die.<br>
<br>
Brynhild bore Sigurd a daughter, Aslaug, who later married Ragnar Lodbrok.<br>

Margie Knauff, long time Paradise resident, passed away Friday, October 26, 2007 after a lengthy illness. <br>
Along with her late husband, Lynn, Margie moved to Paradise just after World War Two. Having worked at Marin Naval Shipyard during the war, the apple orchards and pine forests of Paradise looked like Heaven on earth and she vowed never to move again.  <br>
Margie lived for her family and friends, but after raising two sons, Ron and Don, who survive her, Margie decided to open a small family cafe, where she served great home-cooked meals which are still remembered today. <br>
Retiring in 1974 she spent her last years surrounded by children, grandchildren, her friends and gardens. In spite of her vow, Margie did leave her earthy Paradise on October 26, 2007. <br>
