Anya JOYCE
<p>
<a name ="I094945"><b>[I094945]</b></a><br />
On her motherʼs side, Matushka Anya Marshall is a third generation Russian-American. Her grandfather was born in Blagoveshensk and as a one-year-old was carried over the frozen river Amur by his mother Along with many others, she was escaping from Soviet soldiers shooting at the people running away. After twelve years in Harbin, the family went to San Francisco to join his father. For a few years he had lived and worked all over the West coast of the US doing all kinds of manual jobs earning money to bring his family from China. Matushkaʼs grandmother was also born in Harbin and immigrated to San Francisco with her family when she was three. When her grandparents got married, they decided not to teach their children Russian, "because it was not a wonderful thing to be a Russian in the US after WWII. - Yet, though their mother spoke no Russian and their father was of Irish descent, both Matushka and her brother [Fr. Gregory Joyce, Rector of the St. Vladimir Russian Orthodox Church, in Ann Arbor, MI - Ed.] studied Russian in college. Matushka Anya also lived in Russia for two years after college teaching English and perfecting her Russian.<br>
How did you meet Father Daniel?<br>
<br>
We were set up. Some friends thought we might like each other. But they didnʼt tell me I was going to be meeting someone, so when I saw him, I immediately understood what was happening. And I was not happy that theyʼd done this to me. [Laughing] Theyʼd just thrown me into this situation where I was supposed to be meeting someone and I was not prepared. So, I was not very friendly and after several two to three word exchanges he just gave up on talking to me. Yet, somehow the next day, when we saw each other again and started talking, and once we started talking to each other, it all moved fairly quickly.<br>
<br>
Did you know he wanted to become a priest?<br>
Itʼs very funny, one of our parishioners actually asked me this just this Sunday. I said, "Yes, he was a seminarian [in Holy Trinity Seminary in Jordanville, NY - Ed.], I knew he wanted to be a priest." And he said, "Did that make you want to marry him more?" I said, "NO, that actually made me want to marry him LESS."<br>
A few weeks after we started dating we were having a conversation at a party on Bright Friday, and he says to me because he must already have been getting serious, "You know, what do you think about being a Matushka?" And I said, "NO WAY! That is the last thing that I want to do!" The reason being, because less than a week before, on Holy Saturday, my nephew was born. Now, my brotherʼs a priest. He served all of Holy Week and after the baby was born on Holy Saturday, he said something along the lines of, "Oh, yay! We have a son! See you after Liturgy on Bright Monday!" What are you going to do? The only priest in his parish, itʼs Pascha, he had to go. So, becoming a Matushka was definitely not one of my plans for my life.<br>

Obituary: Died, in Chardon, March 22d, 1875, of malignant scarlet fever, ANSON V. JUDD, aged 20 years and 5 months,<br>
With deep regret we announce the sudden death of our friend--in the early spring of life, when the future must have looked bright and full of promise, Yet we know, though short, it was a complete life--complete in all the pertains to a noble manhood. He was left an orphan at an early age, and was adopted by Mr, and Mrs, E, R, Judd, who took him to their hearts and home, and freely gave him the wealth of a parent's love. Their and affection were not bestowed in vain. He grew up and kind and dutiful son, unselfish in his home life, and in his later years his thoughtful tenderness for his invalid mother was as remarkable as it was beautiful. He left a brother, Mr. Carlos Haynes, and a sister, Mrs. Olive Hurlbutt, and a large circle of friends who lament his early death; for affection for Anson was entwined around many hearts, About a month before his death he made a profession of religion, but had not publicly put on Christ. Yet my we not hope he has gone to be with Him--the he did not cross the deep waters alone?<br>

David Cook JUDD
<p>
<a name ="I085464"><b>[I085464]</b></a><br />
DAVID COOK JUDD was born at Northampton, Mass., December 13th, 1809, being the youngest of six children born of his parents. "He was trained from infancy to habits of industry, sobriety and self-reliance, and his character was early formed upon the principles of stern integrity and morality. He sprang, too, from a pious ancestry, and grew up in the bosom of that church which has been made famous in our land by the pastorates of Edwards and Stodard and Spencer. Under these influences he early became a professor of religion, himself uniting with the church of his fathers."<br>
He was educated in the common schools of his town ; but when quite a youth he entered upon the mercantile pursuits to which he devoted his long life. His first position was that of a clerk in a mercantile house in Boston, but soon after he entered the store of his brother in Springfield, Mass. , where he acquired the habits of system, accuracy and thoroughness which strikingly characterized him through life. After he had attained his maturity he removed to Columbus, Ohio, where he spent a few years. Thence he turned his eyes southward and migrated to what was then the little village of Spartanburg, where he settled and began the business of merchandizing in 1842, which business he steadily continued until within about six months of the time of his death. In 1847 or 1848 he entered into a partnership in said lousiness with his brother-in-law, Mr. Joseph Foster, which comprised the well-known firm of Foster & Judd. Besides his regular business as a merchant, he also, in connection with it, conducted for many years prior to the civil war between the States, the Spartanburg Agency of the Bank of the State of South Carolina, and served also for six years after said war as president of the National Bank of Spartanburg, which office he resigned on account of failing health. In all his business career and dealings he was honest, upright and conscientious, and as such he. was eminently successful. No businessman in Spartanburg was more distinguished than he for his diligence, integrity and fidelity.<br>
Soon after he came to Spartanburg he became a meml3er of the Presbyterian church at that place, which church organization was only in the second year of its existence; "performed an interested and active part in the erection of the church building; was ordained a ruling elder August 15th, 1845, and served as teacher, superintendent and librarian of the Sabbath-school, relinquishing the latter office " only a few years before his death on account of the infirmities of advancing age.<br>
He also served during his day upon the city council of Spartanburg, and in other positions of responsibility and trust besides those already mentioned, and in all lie proved himself to be a man of eminent ability and uprightness.<br>
Mr. Judd was twice married, first to Miss Catharine Foster, who died in 1858, and subsequently to Miss Eliza Attleton, who survives him.<br>
Having lived a life of spotless integrity, Christian -consistency and official fidelity, he died, ministered to by loving hands, at his home in Spartanburg, February 25th, 1882, in his seventy-third year. His remains were followed by a large concourse of people to the spot where for over thirty-five years he had been accustomed to worship God.<br>
