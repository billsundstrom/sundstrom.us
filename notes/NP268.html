<h2>Notes</h2>
Rhodri ap IDWAL
<p>
<a name ="I008705"><b>[I008705]</b></a><br />
From Wikipedia<br>
<br>
Rhodri ap Idwal (c.690-c.754; reigned from c.720) (Latin: Rodericus; English: Roderick), also known as Rhodri Molwynog ('the Bald and Gray'), was a king of Gwynedd.<br>
<br>
The son of Idwal Iwrch and his wife, Princess Angrahad of Brittany, comparatively little is known of Rhodri's life or accomplishments. There is even some debate as to when he actually assumed the throne of Gwynedd, with the years 712, 720, 722 or 730 being the most probable candidates. Legend suggests that Rhodri successfully invaded and occupied Dumnonia for a time, before being expelled by the Saxons. This story may indeed be apocryphal, and others have suggested that Rhodri instead have focused on strengthening the island of Anglesey, which, by this time had become the stronghold of the kingdom. This argument is based on the understanding that Æthelbald, king of Mercia and self-styled Bretwalda, was continuing to press the kingdoms of Wales, and that Rhodri would have been far more likely to have been forced to adopt a defensive, rather than offensive, policy in dealing with incursions from Mercia and other Anglo-Saxon principalities.<br>
<br>
Rhodri married Margaret ferch Duplory, an Irish princess, who bore him a son by the name of Cynan Dindaethwy. Because of the limited reliable information surrounding this period in Welsh history, it is not entirely clear who succeeded Rhodri upon his death, although the most likely candidate seems to be Caradog ap Meirion, a distant cousin, and not his son, who would ascend to the throne only after the death of Caradog.<br>

<a name ="I032342"><b>[I032342]</b></a><br />
David Wallace Illsley was born in Nova Scotia, Canada moving with his parents to Wisconsin when he was eight years old (1873). One year later they settled on a 60 acre farm in Minnesota (farm later owned by Harvey Illsley). He was a pioneer resident of Rice County, Minnesota and public official for many years. He served two terms as a state senator, about 30 years as assessor of Bridgewater Township, about 50 years as a director of the school board in Pleasant Valley, District 22, and was supervisor of road construction for Bridgewater Township for a number of years. David Wallace Illsley married Adelaide (Ladie) Peters who had moved to Little Prairie with her parents from Dixon, Scott County, Iowa, the place of her birth. The Harris Peters family lived across the road from the Illsleys. David and Ladie had six children. Grace passed away at the age of 16 of Consumption (Tuberculosis). In writing of his parents, Irad said that his father was known as big Dave for he weighed 230 pounds. He was known as a very good man with an ax. He cut trees on the farm to make room for a house and hauled the logs to Faribault to have them sawed into lumber to build the house. When the saw mill operator found out that Dave was going to be married, he gave him the sawing bill as a wedding present. As a road overseer, he helped build many miles of the old Jefferson Highway. He and Frank Emery were the ones who instigated putting the first basement under the Little Prairie Church. Dave spent many hours getting the Dundas Cemetery into perpetual care.<br>

Harris Adelbert ILLSLEY
<p>
<a name ="I039548"><b>[I039548]</b></a><br />
Harry Illsley died in his 80th year; on Oct. 16, 1968. He had been a patient in Northfield Hospital for just a few hours, suffering a heart attack after checking into the hospital for tests.<br>
He had driven to a Land O' Lakes meeting two days before. He conferred with Farm Bureau officers about a forthcoming meeting while he was in the hospital. <br>
His death came the morning of the day he was slated to be especially honored at a Land O' Lakes meeting and the day before he was to have been honored as a charter member at the 50th anniversary banquet of the Rice County Farm Bureau Federation. He and his wife, Lois, had planned to leave within a week for their annual winter vacation in Florida.<br>
Illsley was born near Dundas on Aug. 5, 1888, the son of Senator and Mrs. D.W. Illsley. He grew up in the Little Prairie community and spent most of his life there. He had only a sixth grade education, not for lack of interest in school, but for economic necessity. As a very young man, he left his parents' farm to accept employment with the St.Paul Rapid Transit Co. Then for 10 years he fired locomotives for the Soo Line railroad.<br>
But the love of farming proved strong. In 1918 he began buying the Little Prairie farm that had been his wife's childhood home. They were still living there when he died.<br>
Illsley was given the Master Farmer award by The Farmer magazine in 1929. By that time he had dairy cows, hogs and poultry and was raising corn, oats and barley. He had remodeled the farmhouse and improved the farm buildings. He was participating in a soil building practice and he was cooperating with the Farm Management Division of the University Farm in keeping farm accounts. He was president of the Rice County Farm Bureau, president of the Forest Cooperative Creamery, an active member of a livestock shipping association, of a cooperative oil association and the Little Prairie Farmers Club. He was a trustee of the Little Prairie United Methodist Church and chairman of its building fund. <br>
In 1948 he was named Farmer of the Week by the St. Paul Sunday Pioneer Press. As a Land O' Lakes director of District 6 (Rice, Goodhue, Olmsted and Wabasha counties) and president of the Rice County Farm Bureau, he was a pioneer in the cooperative movement. He was also credited with inspiring the organization of the Rice County Dairy Association. He was president of the Rice County Cooperative Association from 1955 until1966. He served on the board of the Community Co-op Oil Association of Rice County, on the district board of directors of Midland Oil and on the board of directors of Mutual Service Insurance Co.<br>
Mr. and Mrs. Illsley celebrated their 50th wedding anniversary with an observance on their lawn; where their wedding had been conducted on June 28, 1916. There were 400 guests from 11states at the golden wedding event.<br>
Mrs. Illsley, who had been an elementary teacher in rural Rice County before her marriage, died in 1979, 11 years after her husband's death. The couple had three children.<br>
Well, of course I knew the Illsleys. I interviewed him at various times. I had no idea, however, until after his death, that he did not have at least a high school education. He was surely a self-educated individual.<br>

Hartford Courant, 2 December 1998<br>
------------------------------------------------------<br>
"My name is James Arthur Ingalls, I come from southwestern NY state in the area of Bolivar, Cuba and Olean. I was born 23 Sept 1922 in Abbotts, in the township of Ischua, a small community north of Cuba Lake, where the lake now stands covers what was once the INGALLS farm of AARON INGALLS b 1802 d 1886. <br>
My father was VIRGIL PHYLETUS INGALLS and my grandfather was BENJAMIN PHYLETUS INGALLS. BENJAMIN was born in Hixton, Wisconsin, the son of PHYLETUS and LYDIA ANN SVITH, who were both from Cuba, NY. <br>
LYDIA was PHYLETUS' 2nd wife; his first wife was LUCY ANN BOOTH, who was born in Elmira, NY and lived in the Cuba area. <br>
LUCY had five children (four boys and one girl), they were FRED, ADIN, SAMUEL, FRANK, and OLIVE. <br>
LYDIA had six children: AARON, BENJAMIN, ELIZABETH, EMMA JANE, AMELIA and CHARLES. AMELIA and ELIZABETH both died as small children.<br>
"As a small boy I remember going to the INGALLS reunion with my parents and hearing about the INGALLS relatives in Michigan and Ohio. I also remember stories about the "Big Five" going to Michigan to see their relatives. I know now that the "Big Five" were Grandfather Benjamin, his sister EMMA JANE and her husband FRANK FISK, also BENJAMIN's half brother SAMUEL and his wife ANNA.<br>
"Our grandsons . . . were asking questions about their background that we could not answer, so my wife PAULINE HILL INGALLS (Polly) started to check into our family history. We attended an INGALLS get together called by LINDA INGALLS WRIGHT.<br>
"If anyone knows anything about FRED and/or ADIN'S family, who were also coming down from PHYLETUS and LUCY ANN, we would like very much to hear from you. These families are a void in our research."<br>
Sincerely, JAMES A. INGALLS<br>
