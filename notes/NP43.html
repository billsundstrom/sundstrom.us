Boleslav I of BOHEMIA
<p>
<a name ="I007760"><b>[I007760]</b></a><br />
From Wikipedia<br>
<br>
Boleslav (or Boleslaus) I the Cruel (? - 972), was the Duke of Bohemia from 929 or 935 to July 15, 972.<br>
<br>
His father was Vratislav I of Bohemia, Duke of Bohemia. Boleslav I had a son named Boleslav II the Pious of Bohemia, Duke of Bohemia, and a daughter named Dobrava/Dubrawka of Bohemia.<br>
<br>
Boleslav is notorious for the murder of his brother St. Wenceslas, the result of which brought him to the Czech (ducal) throne. Nevertheless Boleslav is generally respected by Czech historians as an energetic ruler. Citing Wenceslas' religious policies as the cause of Boleslav's fratricide seems unlikely as Boleslav in no way impeded the growth of Christianity in Bohemia, and in fact he actually sent his sister Mlada (a nun) to Rome to ask permission to make Prague a bishopric.<br>
<br>
One major policy shift after the death of Wenceslas was regarding Czech-German relations. It is usually asserted that Wenceslas was an obedient client of the German King Henry the Fowler. Boleslav on the other hand, found himself almost immediately at war with Henry's successor Otto I the Great. This conflict, presumably consisting of border raids between Boleslav on one side and the Margrave of the Ostmark on the other (the general pattern of warfare in this region at the time) reached its conclusion in 950 when Boleslav signed a peace with Otto. It cannot be said for certain if Boleslav became a vassal of the German King, but it is known that he led a Czech force in alliance with Otto at the great victory over the Magyars at the Lech river (August 10, 955). He had also helped Otto to crush an uprising of Slavs on the Lower Elbe in 953.<br>
<br>
Czech historians also claim that Boleslav expanded his power into Silesia, Lusatia and Moravia, but no dates are given for these alleged conquests. If they did occur, they must have been only transistory gains because Boleslav's successors had to conquer them all over again. Boleslav realised the growth of Polish strength to the north of his borders and he accordingly arranged for his sister Dobrava to marry the Piast prince Mieszko I in 965.<br>
</p>
Boleslav II of BOHEMIA
<p>
<a name ="I007758"><b>[I007758]</b></a><br />
Boleslav II the Pious (died February 7, 999) was the son of Boleslav I the Cruel. Boleslav II became Duke (or Prince) of Bohemia in 972. Boleslav maintained good relations with the German Kingdom, and in 975 supported Otto II during his civil war against Henry of Bavaria. In 977 Boleslav again attacked Bavaria, but on this occasion was barred from annexing any lands by Otto II.<br>
<br>
Boleslav's reign is mostly notable for the foundation of the bishopric of Prague in 973. It was placed within the jurisdiction of the Archbishop of Mainz. In 982 Vojtech (later known as Saint Adalbert of Prague) was appointed to this position until in 994 he abandoned his primacy to lead a mission to the Prussians. On April 23, 997 Adalbert was martyred in Prussia near Gdansk. His bones later became the holiest relic of Poland. War between Poland and Bohemia was continual in this period and by 990 Boleslav had occupied Silesia.<br>
<br>
On September 28, 995 Boleslav stormed Libice in southern Bohemia and massacred the Slavnikovci. This clan had been the main rival of Premyslid power in Bohemia. Boleslav's brutal triumph ensured the unity of Bohemia under a single ruler.<br>
</p>
Borivoj of BOHEMIA
<p>
<a name ="I007764"><b>[I007764]</b></a><br />
Bor(ivoj I was Duke of Bohemia (852/853 - 888/889).<br>
<br>
The head of the Premyslid Czechs who dominated the environs of Prague, Bor(ivoj in c. 870 declared himself knı́e (later translated by German scholars as 'Duke') of the Czechs (Bohemians). Bor(ivoj was recognised as such by his overlord Svyatopluk of Great Moravia around 872 who dispatched Bishop Methodius to begin the conversion of the Czechs to Christianity. Bor(ivoj and his wife Saint Ludmila were baptised by Methodius in 874 and the latter especially became an enthusiastic evangelist, although the religion failed to take root among Bor(ivoj's subjects.<br>
<br>
Around 883 Bor(ivoj was deposed by a revolt in support of his kinsman Strojmir, and restored only with the support of Svyatopluk of Moravia.<br>
<br>
As with most of the early Bohemian rulers, Bor(ivoj is a shadowy figure and exact dates and facts for his reign can never be considered as completely reliable, although several major fortifications and religious foundations are said to have dated from this time. In old Czech legends he is said to be son of a prince of Bohemians called Hostivı́t.<br>
