Robbie and Sabrina were both Osseo Orioles. Sabrina was a cheerleader that Robbie had a big crush on. They became friends through school, but were both in other relationships and never had the opportunity to escalate their relationship. After high school they lost touch for almost 10 years. Robbie posted a picture on Facebook of the Canterbury races and by chance Sabrina commented on it. This sparked their communication! Robbie attempted to get Sabrina to meet up with him at Canterbury, but she had to decline due to previous obligations. Over the next week Sabrina and Robbie communicated frequently via Facebook. Finally they scheduled their first date, watching Sherlock Holmes. From that night they knew they were meant to be together forever. Their relationship escalated quickly and they welcomed their son Reece into the world on April 12, 2011. <br>
