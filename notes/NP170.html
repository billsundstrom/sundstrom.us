Effa Iwa EWING
<p>
<a name ="I061177"><b>[I061177]</b></a><br />
From FindaGrave submission:<br>
We never knew this grandmother and only have the oral accounts of a few people who are gone now. Some shared photos and some records we have found. Effa a daughter, second born child of four children. All born to Daniel Webster Ewing and Queen Victoria (Gilson) Ewing. Effa and Wm. were married in 1884, and by 1900 they were on a homestead near Rockford, Washington. Taking into account the era they lived in 1860 to 1932, and the photos. They lost one baby we think to a misscarriage before 1900. Then they lost two children during an epidemic before 1910. Life was very hard for them. <br>
ANCESTRY.COM SOURSES: Iowa Marriage Records, 1880-1937: Return of Marriage-Allamakee Co., 5th entry up from bottom of page. <br>
---------------------------------------<br>
Effa & William had several children. One daughter, our grandmother, Ida told us that she was the middle child of thirteen children. We have only been able to prove the exhistance of ten children. If anyone knows more we'd love to hear from you. There were several with nicknames that we believe may have been confusing. We know where five of them are buried but the other five are a mystery. We think that Melvin, Millie & a baby are buried on the homestead near Rockford, WA. We know Webster Alexander died in 1979 in Tacoma, WA, but have not found where he is buried. That leaves Henrietta "Etta". We don't know if Etta remarried. We don't know what happened to her when she left the family in 1910. The story about her and Frank killed in a car accidient has been proven wrong. For more detailed notes on the children of this family go to William's F.A.G. Memorial & read his bio. <br>
I finally found what happened to Effa and where she is buried. She did go to Long Beach, California. I have a copy of her California Death Certificate posted for all to see. The principle cause of death was a Carcinoma of the Liver, probably secondary to Carcinoma of the Stomach. She also suffered from Cardio Vascular & Renal Disease for several years. I received a reply from the Los Angeles County Crematorium Cemetery in May 2015. It states she was cremated on Nov. 15, 1932. Her remains went unclaimed, and are now buried in a general area in the cemetery. Most likely in an area with a single marker that only records the year 1932, for the group interments. The photo posted by Larry Luna on 30 Nov. 2016. Shows what her section in the cemetery looked like. There are no markers, didn't expect any. <br>

Halfdan EYSTEINSSON
<p>
<a name ="I007656"><b>[I007656]</b></a><br />
Halfdan the Mild (Old Norse: Hálfdan hinn mildi) was the son of king Eystein Halfdansson, of the House of Yngling and he succeeded his father as king, according to Heimskringla. He was king of Romerike and Vestfold.<br>
<br>
He was said to be generous in gold but to starve his men with food. He was a great warrior who often pillaged and gathered great booty.<br>
<br>
His wife was Liv, the daughter of king Dag of Vestmar. Halfdan the Mild died of illness in his bed.<br>
<br>
He was succeeded by his son, Gudrød the Hunter.<br>
</p>
Ingvar EYSTEINSSON
<p>
<a name ="I008121"><b>[I008121]</b></a><br />
From Wikipedia<br>
<br>
Ingvar or Yngvar Harra, Proto-Norse *Ingu-Hariz (d. early 7th century) was the son of Östen and reclaimed the Swedish throne for the House of Yngling after the Swedes had rebelled against Sölvi.<br>
<br>
Snorri Sturluson relates that King Ingvar, Östen's son, was a great warrior who often spent time patrolling the shores of his kingdom fighting Danes and pirates from the east. King Ingvar finally came to a peace agreement with the Danes and could take care of the Estonian pirates.<br>
<br>
He consequently started pillaging in Estonia in retribution, and one summer he arrived at a place called Stein (see also Sveigder). The Estonians (sýslu kind) assembled a great army in the interior and attacked King Ingvar in a great battle. The Estonian forces were too powerful and Ingvar fell and the Swedish forces retreated. Ingvar was buried in a mound at a place called Stone or Hill fort (at Steini) on the shores of Estonia (Ađalsýsla).<br>
    Certain it is the Estland foe<br>
    The fair-haired Swedish king laid low.<br>
    On Estland's strand, o'er Swedish graves,<br>
    The East Sea sings her song of waves;<br>
    King Yngvar's dirge is ocean's roar<br>
    Resounding on the rock-ribbed shore<br>
<br>
Ynglingatal only mentions the location Sysla (area paying tribute), Historia Norwegiae only mentions that he died during a campaign on the island Eycilla (Ösel). It also adds second son named Sigvard.<br>
<br>
Thorsteins saga Vı́kingssonar skips Ingvar's generation and makes his father Östen the father of Anund and grand-father of Ingjald. It adds a second son to Östen named Olaf, who was the king of Fjordane in Norway.<br>
</p>
Ragnvald EYSTEINSSON
<p>
<a name ="I004825"><b>[I004825]</b></a><br />
Ragnvald Eysteinsson, The Wise (830-890) (Old Norse: Rögnvaldr Mærajarl), Earl of Sunnmøre, Nordmøre and Romsdal, was born in Maer Nord-Trøndelag, Norway and died at the Orkney Islands.<br>
<br>
He was son of Eystein Glumra the Noisy, Earl of Oppland, and grandson of Halfdan the Old.<br>
<br>
His second wife was Ragnhild Ragnhild Hrolfsdottir (Raghldr (Hldr) Hrolfsdóttir) daughter of Hrolfr Nefjaa. Ragnvald was the father of Hrolf Ganger, the founder of Normandy. He was also the father of Turf-Einar, the ancestor of the jarls of Orkney.<br>
<br>
He was the direct ancestor to William I of England, Edward III of England, James I of England, and, therefore, Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. He is therefore the ancestor of most of the royal families of Europe.<br>
