Stanley Mitchell : 1935-2006: Detroit R&B pioneer dies at 71<br>
Another singer whose history stretches back to Detroit's legendary rhythm and blues past has slipped away, as Stanley Mitchell , a singer with the Hamptones, Billy Ward & the Dominos, Stanley and the Tornadoes and, most recently, the Motor City Rhythm and Blues Pioneers, died early Saturday morning in St. John Hospital. He was 71.<br>
Mitchell , a native Detroiter, grew up in that hothouse of Detroit music, the north end. He graduated from Highland Park High School and from his teen years on, made music his life's work.<br>
Norman Thrasher, who sang with the Royal Jokers and Hank Ballard and the Midnighters, also grew up in the north end.<br>
"I've been knowing Stanley all his life," Thrasher says. " Stanley had a strong voice. He was tall and clean cut."<br>
After he passed an audition, Mitchell joined vibraphonist/bandleader Lionel Hampton on the road in his vocal group the Hamptones. When the singer tired of the constant touring and low pay, he came back to Detroit and formed Stanley and the Tornadoes. The group recorded for Chess, hitting No. 5 on the R&B charts with the song "Four O'Clock in the Morning."<br>
With his high, plaintive tenor voice, Mitchell sounded not unlike the legendary Clyde McPhatter, and indeed he was hired by McPhatter's old group, Billy Ward & the Dominos, one of the top R&B acts of the '50s, after Jackie Wilson was fired from the group in 1957. Mitchell stayed long enough to appear on "The Ed Sullivan Show" with the group.<br>
In the mid-'60s Mitchell joined a veteran Detroit group, the Royal Jokers. In 2000, Detroit musician/manager R.J. Spangler put Mitchell together with fellow R&B veterans Joe Weaver and Kenny Martin to form the Motor City R&B Pioneers. Blue Suit Records released their eponymous and only album in 2002.<br>
Mitchell 's last performance was with RJ's Rhythm Rockers on Sept. 4, at the Detroit Jazz Festival's tribute to Weaver. He wasn't feeling well, but sang with his usual professionalism.<br>
The singer is survived by his children, Stanley Jr., Mary and Darece, six grandchildren and five great-grandchildren.<br>
A viewing will be held from 9 a.m. to 9 p.m. Thursday at Peace Chapel, 19530 W. Seven Mile in Detroit. Funeral services will be at 10:30 a.m. Friday at the Russell Street Missionary Baptist Church, 8700 Chrysler Service Drive, in Detroit.<br>

--------------------------------<br>
ABOUT 1 A.M., Audrey Klassen, 46, wife of the manager of the S&A Bar, 21131 Fenkell in Detroit, was shot to death accidentally when a shotgun wielded by her friend, Patricia Vaughn, 34, went off. Police said Mrs. Vaughn, whose husband, James, owns the bar, was holding a shotgun in the air in order to get several persons in the bar to stop fighting. Bartender Larry Kuhy told Mrs. Vaughn to put the shotgun down, police said. As she brought the gun down, the end of the barrel struck the end of the bar. Police said the gun went off, blowing a hole in the front of the bar and striking Mrs. Klassen in the back. Mrs. Klassen was taken to Mt. Carmel Mercy Hospital where she died during emergency treatment.<br>

Margaret BREEZE - Mom was born on the Newhouse farm in the Hagan District, Dec. 8, 1929. The daughter of Arne and Aslaug Moan.

Here they had another daughter Barb and then a few years later they started a younger family, having Lorne first and then Greg. Mom was a homemaker in the true sense. She made the best bread and buns. Her home was always spotless and her door was always open. And she loved to travel. Her and dad took many trips throughout their married lives. Almost always with family or friends. There would always be some memorable story to tell upon return. Usually told with Mom giggling so hard the tears would be running, her laughter bubbling over. There might not have been a lot of money but they were so very rich in friends She loved a good card game or game of any kind. Her Friday bowling group and her once a month casino crowd. In '73 they built their cabin at Candle Lake. So many good times and memories. She loved a busy cabin, visiting, snowmobiling or four-wheeler trips. She just loved to go and it didnʼt matter where. Mom had a great sense of humor and a quick wit, which kept her and those around her going even in the toughest times. She made it easy for us all. Mom was predeceased by two children, her daughter Donna in '74 and son Lorne in '90. As well as her parents, Arne in '95 and Aslaug in '97. Margaret leaves behind her husband of 56 years, Leland. Her children; Ron (Karen) granddaughter Jami(Scott) great granddaughter Tayen Lorne, grandson David(Katie); daughter Barb(Andy) granddaughter Heather; son Greg(Kara) as well as Lorneʼs(Elaine) children, Chelsie and Jonathan.
