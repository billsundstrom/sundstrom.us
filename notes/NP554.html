On December 24, 1904, the gates of heaven rolled wide for this good woman and she passed away to eternal rest. Her passing calls for more than a casual notice. Mrs. Cook was one of the pioneers of this state, born in Toronto, Canada, July 13, 1827, she journeyed from there with her parents to California, making the entire trip across the continent with ox teams. Arriving in California in 1851 she soon after married John Cook, an honored pioneer of this state. It can never be said of Mrs, Cook that she lived in vain. In those early days of California her whole life was given to help those in need of help. She was mother, sister, doctor and nurse to all. None were too poor, too dirty, or too wicked to be comforted, nursed and cared for by her. Many a sad heart was comforted by her loving care, and she would share all she had with those in need, trusting with the faith that never faltered for her own poor needs.<br>
In the early days of San Bernardino as well as of Ventura County she came at last to be a veritable Peter among the poor and needy. "If only her shadow might fall on them they felt comforted.<br>
. . .Mrs. Cook has left a more beautiful monument than any chiseled from marble. It is her good works for others, her kindness to the poor and needy, and the help she gave to those that needed help. . . .<br>
John James Cook, while traveling by train through Arizona, was murdered and no one seems to know where he was buried or any more of the details.<br>
