John Byron MANSFIELD
<p>
<a name ="I039328"><b>[I039328]</b></a><br />
John Byron Mansfield, 47, who was born on March 19, 1960, in Oklahoma City, Okla., died on Mother's Day, May 13, 2007. <br>
"Jake," as he liked to be called, is now in the loving company of his mother, father, and 17-year companion, Sabbath, a beautiful, gentle-spirited Somoyed Malamute/wolf. <br>
After graduating from high school, Jake moved to Florida and later to Texas, taking on odd jobs to make his way. After several years he returned home to Minneapolis. Shortly thereafter he was blessed with the arrival of his beloved daughter, Monica. <br>
In his 47 years he lived a hundred lives and then some, often on a very tough road. He found a home and welcoming community in Virginia, Minn. He lived there the past seven years before he was moved to a nursing home in Minneapolis to be near his family and childhood friends. During the past year he bravely battled for his life against liver and kidney failure. It was here that he had the blessing to meet for the first time his baby granddaughter, Ashlee. <br>
A proud father, grandfather, brother and friend he touched with his loving optimistic heart and sense of humor the hearts of many souls. With great sadness, his illness separated him for much of his life from the ones he loved the most. <br>
In his optimism to overcome adversity, in his final days he announced that in the spring he was going to get a bike and go riding on the trails. He never gave up on his greatest dream, which was to be present in the lives of his daughter and granddaughter. <br>
Jake is survived by his daughter, Monica Lang, her mother, Barb Lang-Khotsombath, granddaughter, Ashlee Flynn, and her father, Joe Flynn; sister, Mary Jane Mansfield; and nephew, Darien Cervin, and his father, David Cervin. <br>
A graveside service was held on Friday, May 25, at Lakeview Cemetery, Hertel. Pastor Martin Nolet officiated. <br>

Mary Jane MANSFIELD
<p>
<a name ="I039329"><b>[I039329]</b></a><br />
Artist Mary Jane Mansfield's creative identity comes out of a rich history of performance art from DaDa to the 70's and early 80's performance art era where life/art was a prevalent theme. Ms. Mansfield studied under Mike Kelley in the early 80's. She is best known for her work with water and electricity. Light bulbs underwater in buckets and jars and pouring cold water over them have long been a thread that runs through her work in sculpture, performance and installation.<br>
For round 3 of the Whittier neighborhood Artists in Storefronts projects she has been commissioned to create an installation in an empty lot at 26th and Stevens. For this project she created a house with no walls and a picket fence filled with summers warm and lively colors. The remainder of the lot will host community snowman building events as weather permits. Keep your eyes peeled on the artist in storefronts website for dates and times whenever you see it snow!!<br>
Ms. Mansfield is a recent recipient of an NEA grant from Franconia sculpture park and an Artists initiative grant from the MN State Arts Board.<br>

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
Waterloo, July 10 - Following an alleged attempt at suicide, <br>
Mrs. Etta Millard, 37, wife of Leon Millard of 225 East Klisha street, was admitted to the Waterloo Memorial Hospital at 3 o'clock yesterday morning, after Sheriff Herbert yells had answered the second call to the domestic domicile of the Mlllards. It was found that the patient had taken a large quantity of Lysol a short time before the call.<br>
The first call preceding the announcement that the woman had attempted suicide was at I2:30 when neighbors after an attempt to locate a policeman called the sheriff's office after they had become alarmed at a disturbance at the Millard home. Responding quickly the sheriff found with a badly lacerated wrist, which he swore was received when his wife had made an attack.<br>
Sheriff Yells drove to the home of Police Justice Maloney and brought him to the jail of rice where the man and wife were charged with disorderly conduct- As a result of this hearing the matter was adjourned for thirty days and both man and wife were allowed to go home. About two and a half hours after they left the sheriff's office the call came in again, this time from the home of Mr. and Mrs. Millard.<br>
At the hospital last night the woman's condition was reported favorable and It was believed that she would be discharged later in the day.<br>
