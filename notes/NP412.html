Garcia II Jimenez of PAMPLONA
<p>
<a name ="I015184"><b>[I015184]</b></a><br />
From Wikipedia<br>
<br>
Garcia Jimenez, Regent and co-king of Kingdom of Pamplona at least from 870, until his death in 882.<br>
<br>
He was the son of Jimeno I of Pamplona (lord Ximeno Garces), lord of Alava, who held the kingdom up to 860. It seems possible that their branch of the Basque dynasty (as they had brought their own territories to the Pamplonan realm) was entitled to position of sort of co-king, thus Garcia II may have been a co-regent already in the lifetime of Garcia I.<br>
<br>
When his kinsman king Garcia I of Pamplona died in 870 and Prince Fortun Garces, the heir of the deceased, was imprisoned in Cordoba, Garcia Jimenez became uncontested Regent of the kingdom and was treated as chief king.<br>
<br>
Garcia II Jimenez zealously defended his country against the encroachments of Islam, but was killed at Ayhar (882) in a battle against the Emir of Cordova.<br>
<br>
Garcia's kinsman Fortun Garcez had been released from captivity in 880 and returned to be king. Probably they were co-kings, and Fortun became the chief king or the sole king only at the death of his kinsman Garcia II.<br>
<br>
After the coup against Fortun in 905, Jimeno Garces' line totally took over the kingship.<br>
<br>
Garcia Jimenez was co-king as Garcia II of Pamplona. His sons were kings or co-kings Inigo II, Sancho I and Jimeno II. The eldest of these was Inigo II Garcez and the second was Sancho I of Pamplona who became sole king in 905.<br>
