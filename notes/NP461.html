Joseph ROOT
<p>
<a name ="I005958"><b>[I005958]</b></a><br />
Joseph Roote<br>
  He married Hannah Haines in Northampton, Hampshire, Ma., 30 Dec 1660. Hannah was born in Springfield, Hampden, Ma., about 1641. Hannah was the daughter of Edmund Haines and Hannah Lambe. Hannah died 28 Jan 1691 in Northampton, Hampshire, Ma., at 49 years of age. Hannah's name has also been spelled "Haynes". He secondly married Mary Holton, daughter of William Holton (b. 20 Oct 1610) and Mary (b. Nov 1691), bet 1690/1692. Born ca 1636. Died on 16 Dec 1713 in Northfield, Franklin, MA.<br>
<br>
  Joseph went to Northampton with his father, arriving there in 1654/55. His first home lot was along the east side of King Street, only about 2 acres in size. Since every settler was entitled to 4 acres, an additional 2 acres was granted, on the west side of the street for all the settlers except Joseph. This may have been because of his age (about 16 at that time), or because he was unmarried.<br>
<br>
  In March of 1657/58, the town decided to apportion some land in the meadows, and lots were to be cast by those petitioners. Joseph Root drew 1 1/4 acres, adjoining Robert Hayward, John Stebbins 4 acres, Arthur Williams 5 acres, and Joseph Janes 1 acre & 1 rod.<br>
(Due to the paucity of land that he owned, his name does not appear on the list of contributers to the cause of attracting a minister, although he had voted in favor of doing so.)<br>
<br>
  When the town performed an inventory (about 1663), in an attempt to settle disputed lines between properties, Joseph Root was shown as having only his 2 acre home lot plus 10 acres of meadow land.<br>

Thomas ROOTE
<p>
<a name ="I005976"><b>[I005976]</b></a><br />
Thomas Roote 2<br>
(16 Jan 1604/05 - 17 Jun 1694)<br>
  1  He married Sarah Clark in Hartford, CT, about 1639. Sarah was born in England about 1620. Sarah died after 1712 in Lebanon, New London, CT. The reference to Sarah Clark as Thomas Roote's wife is unproven. Another researcher suggests that her name may have been Elizabeth, with no known surname.<br>
<br>
There is also no known date or place of marriage, and no one other than Thomas, signed the Church Covenant of Northampton in 1661.<br>
<br>
  Thomas Roote was one of the original petitioners to the General Court, to "inhabit and plante Nonotuck". He and his family removed from Hartford to Northampton in 1654/55, becoming early settlers of that town. He is reported to have had six sons and one daughter, all born in Hartford. His wife is listed as Sarah Clark, but that is definitely disputed by many Roote researchers.<br>
<br>
  From J.R. Trumbull's "History of Northampton" -<br>
<br>
"Thomas Roote was at Salem in 1637, at Hartford two years afterwards, and removed to Northampton in 1655. He was among the first settlers to arrive here, and was one of the signers of the original petition to inhabit Nonotuck. A quiet, substantial farmer, though a weaver by trade, he never arrived at the position of leader. He was several times elected a selectman, and was one of the officers of the town when careful men were in demand. His home lot was on the easterly side of Pleasant Street, below what is now Pearl Street. He died in 1694, at the advanced age of 84 years. He had six sons and one daughter, all born before he removed to Northampton."<br>
<br>
  From "Root Genealogical Records" originally published in 1870 by James Pierce Root.<br>
<br>
"Thomas Roote, believed to be the son of John Roote and Mary Ann Russell of Badby, England, born Jan. 16, 1605, came to this country about the year 1637, and was among the first settlers of Hartford, CT, where he lived many years, and where his children were born, although on account of the incompleteness of the ancient records of Hartford, as they have come down to this generation, the birth of only one of them (John) is recorded. This Thos. Roote is to be distinguished from the Thomas Rootes who was a resident of Salem, Mass., about the same period, and who remained there until his death."<br>
<br>
  "Thomas Roote (probably this settler of Hartford) went to Pequot in 1637, as a soldier," says Hon. R. H. Hinman.<br>
<br>
"The name of Thom. Roote is mentioned in the list of proprietors of undivided lands in 1639, and may be found on the monument in the old grave-yard in Hartford, in the rear of the Center Church, erected by the Ancient Burial Ground Association in memory of the first settlers of the city. He was a considerable landholder there, and one parcel fo the land assigned to him was located on what is now [1870] North Main street, about a mile west of the State House. After a residence of about fifteen years in Hartford he removed with his six sons and one daughter, and settled in Northampton, Mass., on the 9th day of May, 1654, as one of the planters of what was then called Nonotuck. In the Massachusetts Colonial Documents we find that in 1659, on petition, he was appointed one of the selectmen.<br>
<br>
"He was both farmer and weaver of cloth. His record of lands assigned him by the town is dated 7th Dec., 1659. On the 18th of June, 1661, the parish church was gathered, and the Rev. Eleazar Mather was ordained as pastor and teacher of the flock. Among the eight pillars of the church thus organized was Thomas Roote. It is believed by some that he was a deacon of the church. The old Root homestead in Northampton was on King street, opposite where the Roman Catholic church now stands, and it has only within a few years been torn down. Thomas Roote died at a very advanced age, on the 17th of July, 1694, age 89, naming his children in his will, and mentioning that he lived with his son Jonathan at the old homestead. The name of Thomas Roote's wife is not known."<br>
<br>
  2  "Thomas came to America on the ship Increase in 1637, living initially in Salem, MA. He was one of the founders of Hartford, CT. In 1639, his home lot was on the east side of the cow pasture (North Main Street). He was a farmer and a weaver. Along with John Holloway, he was elected as a chimney viewer in Hartford in 1648. He also served in the Pequot war (French and Indian War). His name may be found on the monument in the old grave yard in Hartford, in rear of the Center Church, erected by the Ancient Burial Ground Association in memory of the first settlers of the city. Thomas moved to Northampton, MA on 9 May 1654, where he became one of the eight "pillars of the church" under Reverend Eleazar Mather, Deacon of the church. He was a selectman in 1659. He is referred to as one of the planters of Nonatuck, the original Indian name for the town of Northampton. His wife's name is not known. Thomas died at age 89 while living with his son Jonathan at the old homestead on King Street.<br>

Thomas ROOTE
<p>
<a name ="I005984"><b>[I005984]</b></a><br />
Thomas Roote  (1555 - 1609)<br>
  Thomas Roote was born in, and lived in, a town called Badby, England, which was a parish in Northampton County. The Bishopric of London had Northampton County as his Diocese. The ancient name for Badby was Baddebi, which could have been derived from the Saxon words bade (a pledge in security) and bye (a dwelling or habitation). In the 1600 time frame, Badby was about 2.5 miles from Daventry. The village stood on the side of a sandy ascent called Badby - Down, and there were numerous springs of water and quarries of hard blue rag stones. It is a rural landscape, including Ardbury Hill, which includes about 10 acres of entrenchments reportedly built by the Romans. The village consisted of 86 houses and three inns. The three inns were named "Court House," "Burchill House," and "Root House." Thomas Roote married Elizabeth Parker, who bore him one child, John. Thomas died in 1609 and is buried in a churchyard in Badby. John Roote was raised by an uncle who adopted him. This uncle was a man of wealth, advanced in years, a zealous opponent of Popery, and considered one of the nobility.<br>

Three Killed in Halifax Explosion <br>
While Dismantling Abandoned Manufacturing Plants <br>
Waverley, N.S., July 26-The crushed bodies of three experts of Canadian Industries, Limited, lay in a Halifax morgue today while a coroner's jury prepared to investigate the explosion of nitro-glycerine that buried them under tons of debris near an abandoned manufacturing plant they had been making safe for the public.<br>
A few hours after the blast early last night, volunteer rescue workers recovered the body of Joseph Cole, Rigaud, Que., considered one of the greatest technical experts on explosives in Canada. But it was not until today that the bodies of Harold M. Roscoe, District Sales Manager of the C. I. L. explosives division in Halifax, and William Pitcher, works manager of the company's fertilizer plant in Halifax, were found in the ruins.<br>
Willis Leighton of Waverley, who was carrying 10 sticks of dynamite into the woods for safety when the unexpected blast occurred, escaped death as he was hurled into an old well filled with straw and rubbish.<br>
The company had decided to remove danger of the explosions around abandoned plants in the country and for months Cole and other experts had been clearing them of traces of nitro-glycerine. <br>
Last night's tragedy was believed to have been caused by a greater quantity of the explosive than thought had saturated the property during the many years the plant was in operation.<br>

Josiah Sweet Roscoe, b. Dec 1745 at New Canaan, Fairfield, CT, d. Nov 1812 at Billtown, NS.<br>
He married 26 Aug 1785 at St John ºs Anglican Church, Cornwallis, NS<br>
His bride was Lydia Sweet, b abt 1765 ar Cornwallis, Kings, NS.<br>
<br>
Dr. Muriel V. Roscoe wrote in her geneology  - 21 June 1984<br>
On February 26, 1793, Josiah Sweet RUSCO, stonemason, bought land from Barnabas Tuttle LORD, some 15 acres on the right side of Silas WOODWORTH's 200 acre division. This was in the Cornwallis township of Kings County, Nova Scotia. The place is known as Centreville. He built a house and established the family home there. At that date, Theophilus, was (?) years old; James was 9; Lydia 4 and Joseph 2. William was born three years later, in 1796. <br>
Josiah died in 1812/13. In September, 1816, Lydia married Oliver THORP and moved to North Mountain. In 1819 Theophilus left for Petitcodiac, N.B., but ultimately settled in River Philip. James had married Isabell ROBINSON and moved to Hall's Harbour. Josiah married Catherine ATKINSON in October, 1820, and took up farming across the Minas Basin in what later was called West River. William had married on January 4, 1820, Amy Miner PORTER and they remained in the Centreville home. <br>
It should perhaps be noted when Theophilus and Josiah settled in River Philip and West River, they still were in Kings County, although in the township of Parrsborough. That portion of Kings did not become included in Cumberland County until 1840. <br>

<a name ="I035200"><b>[I035200]</b></a><br />
Patricia Ann Andrews 1936 - 2010 On Tuesday January 5, 2010, God took back one of his most precious and beloved children when she returned to be with him suddenly and unexpectedly. She will be missed and never forgotten. She truly did embrace the kind of unselfish, compassionate person that should be the mold for others to follow. Those of you who knew her will have already known this before you began reading. "Pat", as she was known, was born in Brockton, Massachusetts on December 9, 1936 and recently celebrated her 73rd birthday. She spent the better part of her later years working first in a home for the care of elderly people and it was later converted to a facility for patients with special needs. She ended her working career a few years ago working at various diners as a waitress, hostess and cook (if he didn't show up)! We suspect she gave half of her tips to others that she deemed needed it more. She really didn't see bad in people, only new opportunities for people and family to help get back on their feet. May she finally rest in peace. A viewing open to the public will be held Tuesday, January 12th from 6 - 8:00 p.m. at the Holbrook Mortuary, 3251 South 2300 East.<br>
