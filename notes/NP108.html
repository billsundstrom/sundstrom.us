<p>
<a name ="I108714"><b>[I108714]</b></a><br />
On May 26, Audrey Cross Tafel was brought home from the hospital by her loving family to be able to pass away in her own bed on her own terms, surrounded by the clan she created. On May 27, she gently left the room to join her beloved "Bud" (Frederick C. Tafel, Jr.) who was taken far too soon. In her 89th year she has been reunited with her parents, Lewis B. Cross and Susannah Cowburn Cross and her "bestest" sister, Joan Cross Mashburn.<br>
The love and adoration we all had for Mom / Grams / GG/ Aunt Aud is best summed up by these quotes from her kids for Mother's Day:<br>
"Mom's beauty is completely natural. Her permanent smile attested by the wrinkles in her cheeks." "She's easy-going, rolls with the tide and always up for an adventure. How many Moms would spend the summer in a tent with five (or more) kids, no plumbing nor electricity?" "She's a compassionate listener and confidante, staying up many a late night dispensing advice about friends, dates and life in general. Her usual advice was 'What will be - will be'." "Sorry, Mom, for the sink falling off the wall, the mysterious stains on the ceiling, the bras and panties on the roof top antenna and countless other mischievous acts." "One of the greatest memories you gave us was our glorious car-ride sing-alongs, which always included your favorite 'In the Little Red Schoolhouse'."<br>
So, though we'll miss her profoundly, we won't mourn her for she is with us always. She has had and will continue to have her hand in what this family has become and has yet to become. As she looks down on us now, still smiling, we shall return the favor! We love you to the moon and back!<br>
Missed and adored by her seven children and their spouses; 14 grandchildren, 11 great-grandchildren, nieces, nephews, cousins and friends.<br>
Services will be held at Sears-Middleton-Jones on Rt 11 in North Syracuse on Saturday, May 30, 2015. Calling hour at 9:30 a.m., services at 10:30 a.m.<br>
