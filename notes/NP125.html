John DE BURGO
<p>
<a name ="I016273"><b>[I016273]</b></a><br />
JOHN, son and heir, was presumably born before 1056, for about 1076 he suddenly claimed and seized the mill of Vains, but after a trial before the King's Court judgement was delivered against him. As John son of Richard he gave the tithe of Saxlingham, Norfolk, to Saint Peter's Abbey, Gloucester, in the time of Abbot Serlon (1072-1103/4). In 1086, described as John nepos W., he was a tenant-in-chief in Norfolk, his estates including the manor of Saxlingham to which the church was appurtenant; and as John nepos Walerami (sic) he held also the single manor of Elsenham ("Alsenham"), in Essex, in chief, and a carucate and a half at Saxlingham of the abbot of St. Benet of Holme. He is said to have been given the advowson of Hockham, Norfolk, by Roger Bigod (died 1107). Nothing is known of his marriage, death or burial. [Complete Peerage XII/2:269-70, (transcribed by Dave Utzinger)]<br>
<br>
Note: In Appendix B, Vol XII/2, the Complete Peerage gives evidence and a lengthy discussion, disproving a long held belief that John was brother of Serlo de Burg (and therefore son of Eustace de Burgo), whom I originally had as his brother. CP also states that John's son Eustace FitzJohn was called Monoculus, possibly as a hereditary nickname from his father, but potentially in place of his father.<br>

<a name ="I007490"><b>[I007490]</b></a><br />
From Wikipedia<br>
<br>
Otto-William (died 1026) was duke of Burgundy between 1002 and 1004. Otto-William was son of Adalbert, deposed King of Italy, and step-son of Otto-Henry, the Great, who he succeeded in the duchy at a young age.<br>
<br>
Determined to be sovereign ruler of his own lands, Otto-William revolted against Henry II, Holy Roman Emperor in 1016. Burgundy was annexed to the crown of France by king Robert II in 1004, and after this date, Otto-William was nominal count of Burgundy. Later Robert gave the duchy to his heir, future king Henry I of France.<br>
<br>
He married Ermentrude of Reims, daughter of Count Renaud of Reims. Their children were:<br>
   1. Agnes of Burgundy, married (1) William V of Aquitaine; (2) Geoffrey II of Anjou<br>
   2. Geberge of Burgundy, married Guilhem II of Provence<br>
   3. Matilda of Burgundy, married Landri of Nevers<br>
   4. Renaud I, Count of Burgundy<br>

Robert DE CAEN
<p>
<a name ="I005390"><b>[I005390]</b></a><br />
From Wikipedia<br>
<br>
Robert, 1st Earl of Gloucester (~1090 - October 31, 1147) was an illegitimate son of Henry I of England, and one of the dominant figures of the English Anarchy period.<br>
<br>
Robert was probably the eldest of Henry's many illegitimate children. He was born at Caen in Normandy before his father's accession to the English throne. His mother is not known for certain, though recent scholarship suggests she was a member of the Gay family, minor nobility in Oxfordshire. William of Malmesbury refers to Robert's "Norman, Flemish, and French" ancestry, but this may be a reference only to his father's side of the family. Robert was acknowledged at birth, and raised at his father's court. He had a reputation of being an educated man, not altogether surprising considering his father's scholarly inclinations. He was a patron of William of Malmesbury and Geoffrey of Monmouth.<br>
<br>
He married in 1107 to Mabel of Gloucester, daughter of Robert Fitzhamon, thereby receiving lordship of Gloucester and Glamorgan. She died in 1157. Their children were:<br>
   1. William Fitz Robert, 2nd Earl of Gloucester, died 1183<br>
   2. Roger Fitz Robert, Bishop of Worcester, died 1179<br>
   3. Hamon Fitz Robert, slain at the siege of Toulouse in 1159<br>
   4. Philip Fitz Robert, Castellan of Cricklade, died after 1147<br>
   5. Richard Fitz Robert, lord of Creully, died 1175<br>
   6. Maud of Gloucester, died 1189, wife of Ranulph de Gernon, 2nd Earl of Chester<br>
<br>
In 1119, Robert fought at the Battle of Bremule; he was already one of King Henry's foremost military captains. In 1122, he was created Earl of Gloucester.<br>
<br>
At his father's death, in the struggle between the Empress Matilda and Stephen for the English throne, he at first declared for Stephen, but subsequently left Stephen's service and was loyal to Matilda, his half-sister, until his death. According to the Gesta Stephani:<br>
<br>
    "Among others came Robert, Earl of Gloucester, son of King Henry, but a bastard, a man of proved talent and admirable wisdom. When he was advised, as the story went, to claim the throne on his father's death, deterred by sounder advice he by no means assented, saying it was fairer to yield it to his sister's son (the future Henry II of England), than presumptuously to arrogate it to himself."<br>
<br>
At the Battle of Lincoln, he captured Stephen, whom he imprisoned in the custody of his wife, Mabel. This advantage was lost, however, when Robert fell into the hands of Stephen's partisans at Winchester, covering Matilda's escape from a failed siege. Robert was so important to Matilda's cause that she released Stephen to regain Robert's services. In 1142 she sent Robert to convince her husband Geoffrey of Anjou to join her cause. Geoffrey refused to go to England until he conquered Normandy, so Robert stayed in France to help him until he learned of Matilda being besieged at Oxford. He hastened back to England, along with Matilda's young son Henry. In 1144 one of Robert's own sons, Philip, declared for Stephen and so Robert found himself and his son on opposite sides.<br>
<br>
Robert fought tirelessly on Matilda's behalf until his death in 1147 from a fever at Bristol. One of his illegitimate sons was Richard, Bishop of Bayeux (died 1142).<br>

The first of the family on record by the name of Peyton was Reginald de Peyton, second son of Walter, Lord of Sibton, younger brother of Mallet, sheriff of Yorkshire. This Reginald held the lordships of Peyton Hall, in Ramshold, and Boxford, in Suffolk, of Hugh de Bigod; he was stewerd to Roger Bigod, Earl of Norfolk, and gave lands to the monks of Thetford, to pray for the soul of Hugh Bigod. He had two sons, William, who held certain lands in Boxford, of the fee of the abbey of St. Edmundsbury, as appears by charter of his nephew John, and John de Peyton.

Isabel DE CAMVILLE
<p>
<a name ="I012399"><b>[I012399]</b></a><br />
Early in the 12th Century, Stanton was given by Henry I to his second wife, Queen Adeliza (or Adela). A large part of it she presented to a kinswomen, Millicent de Camville. From the latter it was inherited in 1191 by Isabel de Camville, and thus passed to her husband Richard deHarcourt, from whom it has come down through the Harcourt family to the present day and from which circumstance the Manor and the village itself became known as Stanton Harcourt. Queen Adeliza also gave land at Stanton to Reading Abbey, which remained patron of the parish church fill the Dissolution of the Monasteries. A close relationship with St Michaels Church has been maintained by the Harcourts, and it contains the chapel under which members of the family have been buried since the 15th century.<br>

   3. George de Cantelou (died 1273).<br>
<br>
He died "in the flower of his youth" in 1254. Simon de Montfort, a close friend of the family, was the chief mourner at William's funeral. His arms were: De gueules, à trois fleurs de lys d'or.<br>

Alfonso VI DE CASTILE
<p>
<a name ="I007706"><b>[I007706]</b></a><br />
From Wikipedia<br>
<br>
Alfonso VI (before June 1040 - July 1, 1109), nicknamed the Brave, was king of León from 1065 to 1109 and king of Castile since 1072 after his brother's death. Much romance has gathered round his name.<br>
<br>
In the cantar de gesta of the Cid, he plays the part attributed by medieval poets to the greatest kings, and to Charlemagne himself. He is alternately the oppressor and the victim of heroic and self-willed nobles - the idealized types of the patrons for whom the jongleurs and troubadours sang. He is the hero of a cantar de gesta which, like all but a very few of the early Spanish songs, like the cantar of Bernardo del Carpio and the Infantes of Lara, exists now only in the fragments incorporated in the chronicle of Alfonso the Wise or in ballad form.<br>
<br>
His flight from the monastery of Sahagun, where his brother Sancho endeavoured to imprison him, his chivalrous friendship for his host Almamun of Toledo, caballero aunque moro, "a knight although a Moor", the passionate loyalty of his vassal Peranzules, and his brotherly love for his sister Urraca of Zamora, may owe something to the poet who took him as a hero.<br>
<br>
They are the answer to the poet of the nobles who represented the king as having submitted to taking a degrading oath at the hands of Ruy Diaz de Vivar (El Cid), in the church of Santa Gadea at Burgos, and as having then persecuted the brave man who defied him.<br>
<br>
When every allowance is made, Alfonso VI stands out as a strong man fighting as a king whose interest was law and order, and who was the leader of the nation in the reconquest. He impressed himself on the arabs as a very fierce and astute enemy, but as a keeper of his word. A story of Muslim origin, which is probably no more historical than the oath of Santa Gadea, tells of how he allowed himself to be tricked by Ibn Ammar, the favourite of Al Mutamid, the king of Seville. They played chess for an extremely beautiful table and set of men, belonging to Ibn Ammar. Table and men were to go to the king if he won. If Ibn Ammar gained he was to name the stake. The latter did win and demanded that the Christian king should spare Seville. Alfonso kept his word.<br>
<br>
Whatever truth may lie behind the romantic tales of Christian and Muslim, we know that Alfonso represented in a remarkable way the two great influences then shaping the character and civilization of Spain.<br>
<br>
Alfonso married at least five times, had two mistresses, and one fiancee. His first wife was Agnes, daughter of William VII of Aquitaine. They had no children and were divorced due to consanguity. The second wife was Constance of Burgundy; their daughter was Urraca of Castile. Prior to this he was betrothed to Agatha, one of the daughters of William I of England. Two later wives, Beatrice and Bertha, are of unknown origin. By his mistress Jimena Muñoz, daughter of the Count of Asturias, he had two illegitimate daughters: Teresa of Leon and Elvira of Castile.<br>
<br>
At the instigation, it is said, of his wife Constance, he brought the Cistercian Order into Spain, established them in Sahagun, chose a French Cistercian, Bernard, as the first archbishop of Toledo after the reconquest on May 25, 1085, married his daughters, Urraca of Castile, the legitimate and Teresa of Leon, the illegitimate, to French princes, and in every way forwarded the spread of French influence - then the greatest civilizing force in Europe. He also drew Spain nearer to the Papacy, and it was his decision which established the Roman ritual in place of the old missal of Saint Isidore - the Mozarabic rite.<br>
<br>
On the other hand he was very open to Arabic influence. He protected the Muslims among his subjects and struck coins with inscriptions in Arabic letters. After the death of Constance he perhaps married and he certainly lived with Zaida, said to have been a daughter-in-law of Al Mutamid, Muslim king of Seville. Alfonso's wife Isabel, who bore him the only son, Sancho, among his many children, may have been this Zaida, who became a Christian under the name of Maria or Isabel. Isabel also bore him two daughters, Elvira Alfonso (who married Roger II of Sicily) and Sancha (wife of Rodrigo Gonzalez de Lara).<br>
<br>
Sancho, Alfonso's designated successor, was slain at the battle of Ucles in 1108.<br>

Alfonso VII Raimúndez DE CASTILE
<p>
<a name ="I007700"><b>[I007700]</b></a><br />
Alfonso VII of Castile (March 1, 1104/5 - August 21, 1157), nicknamed the Emperor, was the king of Castile and Leon since 1126, son of Urraca of Castile and Count Raymond of Burgundy.<br>
<br>
Alfonso was a dignified and somewhat enigmatic figure. A vague tradition had always assigned the title of emperor to the sovereign who held Leon. This sovereign was considered the most direct representative of the Visigoth kings, who were themselves the representatives of the Roman empire. But though given in charters, and claimed by Alfonso VI of Castile and Alfonso I of Aragon, the title had been little more than a flourish of rhetoric.<br>
<br>
In 1128 he married Berenguela of Barcelona, daughter of Ramon Berenguer III, Count of Barcelona. She died in 1149; their children were:<br>
   1. Sancho III of Castile (1134-1158)<br>
   2. Ferdinand II of Leon (1137-1188)<br>
   3. Sancha (1137-1179), married Sancho VI of Navarre<br>
   4. Constanza (1141-1160), married Louis VII of France<br>
<br>
Alfonso remarried in 1152 to Richeza of Poland, the daughter of Wladislaus II the Exile of Poland. Their daughter was Sancha (1155-1208), the wife of Alfonso II of Aragon. His illegitimate daughter, Urraca, married Garcia IV of Navarre.<br>
<br>
Alfonso VII was crowned emperor in 1135 after the death of Alfonso I. The weakness of Aragon enabled him to make his superiority effective. He appears to have striven for the formation of a national unity, which Spain had never possessed since the fall of the Visigoth kingdom. The elements he had to deal with could not be welded together.<br>
<br>
Alfonso was at once a patron of the church, and a protector if not a supporter of the Muslims, who formed a large part of his subjects. His reign ended in an unsuccessful campaign against the rising power of the Almohades. Though he was not actually defeated, his death in the pass of Muradel in the Sierra Morena, while on his way back to Toledo, occurred in circumstances which showed that no man could be what he claimed to be -- "king of the men of the two religions."<br>

Eleonor DE CASTILE

<a name ="I008262"><b>[I008262]</b></a><br />
From Wikipedia<br>
<br>
Eleanor of Castile (1241 - 28 November 1290) was the first queen consort of Edward I of England. Eleanor was born in Castile, Spain, the daughter of Fernando III, King of Castile and Leon and his second wife, Jeanne, Countess of Ponthieu. Her given name was Leonor (she was called Eleanor in England). Her birthdate is not certainly known, but it is known that she was the second of the three children born to Fernando and Jeanne. Her elder brother Fernando was born 1239/40 and her younger brother Luis was born 1242/43. For the ceremonies in 1291 marking the first anniversary of Eleanor's death, 49 candlebearers appear, each candle commemorating one year of her life. This would place her birth in 1241.<br>
<br>
She married Edward, the son of Henry III of England, in October 1254 at Burgos and became queen in 1272 when his father died and he became king. Theirs was one of the most successful royal marriages of all time, and she often accompanied her husband on his military campaigns, giving birth to his fourth son (later King Edward II of England) at Caernarfon in 1284, immediately after the conquest of Wales. She gave birth to fifteen children all told, six of whom survived into adulthood, but only four of whom outlived their parents.<br>
<br>
Eleanor is remembered warmly by history as the queen who inspired the Eleanor crosses, but she was not so loved in her own time. Her English subjects considered her to be too foreign and greedy. Walter of Guisborough preserves the following poem:<br>
<br>
    "The king desires to get our gold/the queen, our manors fair to hold..."<br>
<br>
She and Edward seemed to have been more devoted to one another than to their offspring. Their daughter Joan was left to be raised by her grandmother in Ponthieu for much of her childhood. When their son Henry lay dying at Guildford, neither of his royal parents undertook the short journey from London to see him.<br>
<br>
Eleanor died on November 28, 1290, at Nottingham (believed actually Harby, Nottinghamshire rather than the city), and her body was returned to London for burial at Westminster Abbey. Such was Edward's devotion to her that he erected memorial crosses at each overnight stop. Three of these "Eleanor crosses" are still landmarks today, although the most famous at Charing Cross (from which its name derives) is a copy. He did not remarry for nine years, to Marguerite of France, in 1299.<br>
<br>
The locations of the 12 crosses were as follows: Lincoln, Grantham, Stamford, Geddington, Northampton, Stony Stratford, Woburn, Dunstable, St Albans, Waltham, Westcheap, and Charing.<br>

Fernando DE CASTILE
<p>
<a name ="I008273"><b>[I008273]</b></a><br />
Fernando III called El Santo (the Saint), (1198/1199 - May 30, 1252) was a king of Castile (1217 - 1252) and Leon (1230 - 1252). He was the son of Alfonso IX and Berenguela of Castile, daughter of Alfonso VIII. Because his parents were first cousins, their marriage was anulled, but Fernando remained legitimized and was able to succeed his father as king.<br>
<br>
In 1231 he united Castile and Leon permanently.<br>
<br>
Fernando spent much of his reign fighting the Moors. He captured the towns of Córdoba in 1236, Jaén in 1246, and Seville in 1248, and occupied Murcia in 1243, thereby completing the reconquest of Spain excepting Granada, whose king nevertheless did homage to Fernando.<br>
<br>
He founded the University of Salamanca and the Cathedral of Burgos.<br>
<br>
Fernando was canonized by Pope Clement X in 1671. Several places named San Fernando were founded across the Spanish Empire.<br>
<br>
Marriages and Family<br>
<br>
In 1219, Ferdinand married the daughter of the German king Philip of Swabia, Elizabeth, called Beatriz in Spain. Their children were:<br>
   1. King Alfonso X of Castile (November 23, 1221-1284)<br>
   2. Infante Fadrique (September 1223-1277), secretly executed by his brother Alfonso.<br>
   3. Infante Fernando (March 1225-1243/1248)<br>
   4. Infanta Leonor (1227-died young)<br>
   5. Infanta Berenguela, a nun at las Huelgas (1228-1288/89).<br>
   6. Infante Enrique "El Senador" (March 1230-August 1304)<br>
   7. Infante Felipe (December 1231-1274). He was promised to the Church, but was so taken with the beauty of Princess Christine of Norway (daughter of Haakon IV of Norway), who had been intended as a bride for one of his brothers, that he abandoned his holy vows and married her. She died in 1262, childless.<br>
   8. Infante Sancho, Archbishop of Toledo and Seville (1233-1261)<br>
   9. Infante Juan Manuel (1234-November 1283)<br>
  10. Infanta Maria, died an infant in November 1235.<br>
<br>
After Elizabeth died in 1235, he married Jeanne de Dammartin, Countess of Ponthieu, before August 1237. They had four sons and one daughter:<br>
   1. Infante Fernando, Count of Aumale (1239-1269)<br>
   2. Eleanor of Castile (1241-1290), wife of King Edward I of England.<br>
   3. Infante Luis (1243-1269)<br>
   4. Infante Ximen (1244), died young and buried in a monastery in Toledo.<br>
   5. Infante Juan (1245), died young and buried at the cathedral in Cordoba.<br>
</p>
Fernando I DE CASTILE
<p>
<a name ="I007717"><b>[I007717]</b></a><br />
Ferdinand I of Castile, known as El Magno or "the Great," (d. 1065), was King of Castille and King of Léon from 1035 to 1065.<br>
<br>
Life<br>
Ferdinand was the eldest son of Sancho III of Navarre. He was barely in his teens when he was put in possession of Castile in 1028 with his father's backing, on the murder of the last Count, as the heir of his mother Munia , daughter of a previous count of Castile and sister of the deceased count. The count, Don Garcı́a, was about to be married to Doña Sancha, sister of Bermudo, king of León, but was assassinated as he was entering the church of St.John Baptist in León by a party of Castilian nobles, exiles from their own land, who had taken refuge in Leon.<br>
<br>
Ferdinand now married Sancha of Leon instead. He reigned in Castile with the title of king from 1033. His father king Sancho died in 1036, and Ferdinand became the "high king" of the dynasty. In 1038, when his brother-in-law Bermudo was killed in battle with Ferdinand at Tamaron, Ferdinand took possession of León as well, by right of his wife who was the heiress presumptive of Bermudo. He overran the Moorish section of Galicia, and set up his vassal as count in what is now northern Portugal. With northern Spain consolidated, Ferdinand, in 1056, proclaimed himself emperor of Hispania. The use of the title was resented by the emperor Henry II, Holy Roman Emperor supported by Pope Victor II in 1055, as implying a claim to the headship of Christendom, and as a usurpation on the Holy Roman Empire. It did not, however, mean more than that the sovereign of León was the chief of the princes of the peninsula, and that Spain was independent of the Empire. Ferdinand's brothers Garcia V of Navarre and Ramiro I of Aragon opposed his power, but were killed in ensuing battles.<br>
<br>
Although Ferdinand had grown in higher power by this strife with Bermudo of León, and though at a later date he defeated and killed his brother Garcı́a of Najera, he ranks high among the kings of Spain who have been counted religious, as religion often subconsciously favors violence. To a large extent he may have owed this reputation to the military victories over the Moors, in which he initiated the period of the Christian reconquest of the peninsula.<br>
<br>
Santa Justa<br>
Ferdinand was probably a pious man. Towards the close of his reign he sent a special embassy to Seville to bring back the body of Santa Justa. The then king of Seville, Motadhid, one of the local princes who had divided the caliphate of Cordova, was himself a sceptic and poisoner, but he stood in wholesome awe of the power of the Christian king. He favoured the embassy in every way, and when the body of Santa Justa could not be found, helped the envoys, who were also aided by a vision seen by one of them in a dream, to discover the body of Isidore of Seville instead. The Doctor's body was reverently carried away to León, where the church of San Juan Bautista (St.John Baptist) was reconsecrated to receive the relics.<br>
<br>
<br>
Death<br>
Ferdinand died on the feast of Saint John the Evangelist, June 24, 1065, in León, with many manifestations of ardent piety, having laid aside his crown and royal mantle, dressed in the robe of a monk and lying on a bier covered with ashes, which was placed before the altar of the church of Saint Isidore.<br>
<br>
At his death, Ferdinand divided up his kingdom between his 3 sons, Sancho, Alfonso, and Garcia, and his two daughters, Elvira and Urraca. By giving them his dominion, he wanted them to abide by the split in the kingdom and respect his wishes. However, Sancho (born 1030), being the oldest, believed that he deserved more of the kingdom, and therefore sought to gain possession of the divided parts of the kingdom that had been given to his brothers and sisters. Elvira of Castille (born 1038) married Garcia II Aza, the son of Garcia Fernandez Aza 3rd Lord.<br>
</p>
Fernán González DE CASTILE
<p>
<a name ="I030926"><b>[I030926]</b></a><br />
Fernán González (died 970) was the first independent count of Castile, son of Gonzalo Fernández de Burgos, who had been named count of Arlanza and the Duero around the year 900, and by tradition a descendant of semi-legendary judge Nuño Rasura. His mother Muniadona Ramı́rez was so well remembered that the later Counts of Castile would sometimes be recorded by Iberian Muslim scholars as Ibn Mama Duna (descendant of Muniadona).<br>
Fernán González was a colourful character of legendary status in Iberia, and founder of the dynasty that would rule a semi-autonomous Castile, laying the foundations for its status as an independent kingdom. In the year 930, Ferdinand's name appears with the title of count inside the administrative organization of eastern the Kingdom of León.<br>
He grew up in the castle of Lara and inherited his father's title after the capture and death of his uncle, Nuño Fernández.<br>
In 931, Fernán gathered under his control a strong military force composed of troops from the counties of Burgos, Asturias, Santillana, Lantaron, Álava, Castile, and Lara. His military prowess came to prominence in the Battle of Simancas in 939 and then at Sepulveda, where he wrested the region from the Moors and repopulated it. As his power increased, so did his independence from León. During this period he married Sancha, the sister of the king of Navarre, Garcı́a Sánchez I. Sancha was a daughter of Sancho I of Pamplona, and Toda of Navarre.<br>
After having fought with Ramiro II of León against the Arabs, and after the Battle of Simancas and the retreat of the Muslims, Fernán was dissatisfied because the king of León distributed his troops in the frontier towns and he rose in rebellion against him. He was, however, defeated and made prisoner in 944, which lasted for 3 years until he became reconciled with his sovereign, giving his daughter Urraca in marriage to the king's son, Ordoño, who afterwards became King Ordoño III.<br>
Notwithstanding this alliance, Fernán continued to foment trouble and discord in León. He later aided Sancho I against his brother Ordoño III, and then Ordoño IV, son of Alfonso IV, against Sancho.<br>
Upon the death of Ramiro II of Leon in 951, the kingdom of León experienced a dynastic crisis that Fernán played out to his advantage.<br>
Initially Fernán supported the demands of Sancho I against his brother Ordoño III, but when Sancho failed, Fernán was forced to recognize Ordoño as king. Ordoño III's early death allowed Fernán to recover his maneuvering capacity, although he abandoned his old ally Sancho, instead supporting his rival Ordoño IV. Defeated in 960 through Navarrese intervention, he was captured by King Garcı́a of Navarre, but he recovered his freedom after making various territorial concessions. With the kingdom of León weakened and in disorder, Fernán slowly solidified his position as legitimate independent count of Castile.<br>
After his death the county was left to his son Garcı́a Fernández. His remains were buried in the monastery of San Pedro of Arlanza.<br>
His life and feats are recorded in an anonymous poem, The Poem of Fernán González, written between 1250 and 1271 and conserved as an incomplete copy from the fifteenth century.<br>
By Sancha of Navarre, he had the following children:<br>
    * Gonzalo, who married Fronilde Gómez, suggested to have been granddaughter of count Diego Rodrı́guez Porcelos<br>
    * Sancho, named in a charter of his paternal grandmother<br>
    * Munio<br>
    * Garcı́a, his eventual successor<br>
    * Urraca, twice queen of León and then of Navarre<br>
    * Muniadona, wife of Gómez Dı́az, count of Saldaña, of the powerful Beni Gómez clan<br>

Garcı́a Fernández DE CASTILE
<p>
<a name ="I030920"><b>[I030920]</b></a><br />
Garcı́a Fernández, called of the White Hands (Spanish: Él de las Manos Blancas) (Burgos, 938 - Córdoba, 995), was the count of Castile and Alava from 970 to 995.<br>
The son of Count Fernán González, he continued to recognise the suzerainty of the Kingdom of León, even though he was practically autonomous. In order to expand his frontiers at the expense of the Moors, in 974 he expanded the social base of the nobility by promulgating decrees stating that any villein of Castrojeriz who equipped a knight for battle would enter the ranks of the nobility. He was succeeded by his son, Sancho I of Castile.In 960, Garcia married Ava of Ribagorza, daughter of Raymond II, count of Ribagorza. They had seven children:<br>
    * Mayor Garcı́a, married Raymond III, count of Pallars-Jussà, they claimed Ribagorza<br>
    * Sancho Garcı́a, conde de Castilla<br>
    * Urraca Garcı́a<br>
    * Gonzalo Garcı́a (died 979), speculated to have been ancestor of the House of Lara<br>
    * Elvira Garcı́a (died 1017), married in 991 Bermudo II of León<br>
    * Toda Garcı́a, married Sancho Gómez of Saldaña, of the powerful Beni Gómez family<br>
    * Oneca Garcı́a, married in 995 Almanzar, chamberlain of Cordoba<br>
</p>
Gonzalo Fernández DE CASTILE
<p>
<a name ="I007675"><b>[I007675]</b></a><br />
Gonzalo Fernández, Count of Burgos (ca. 899-915) and of Castile (c. 909-915).<br>
Recorded for the first time in 899 as Count of Burgos, soon the region expanded to the eastern mountain valleys enabling Gonzalo to make his fort base in Lara, thus stretching his rule from the foot of the Cantabrian Mountains around Espinosa de los Monteros to the river Arlanza, which therefore became the border with the neighbouring Muslim territories. In order to stretch his territory this far, he first had to displace the Muslim forces based at the stronghold of Carazo that dominated the area and access. This was achieved after a long and well contested struggle.<br>
The valley of Lara was then the rallying point of the family that - years later - achieved through his son, Fernan Gonzalez the quasi-independence of Castile, securing the area for five generations with the family until it became a kingdom under Fernando I of Castile of the Jimenez dynasty.<br>
His name appears for the first time in charter of the Monastery of San Pedro de Cardeña (899), one of the most influential monastic houses later in Castile together with the Monastery of Santo Domingo de Silos. He was also the founder of the other Monastic House of San Pedro de Arlanza (912).<br>
In 912, he took main part in the Castilian offensive to the river Duero, settling the old villages of Haza, Clunia and San Esteban de Gormaz.<br>
Gonzalo Fernández appears as Count of Castile for the first time in a document of January 8, 914 and again in January 1, 915. He appears witnessing royal documents among other magnates and nobles at the Leonese Court main Assemblies until the defeat of the Leonese in the battle of Valdejunquera (920), after which he was considered dead. Modern scholars suspect that he must have been in disgrace at Court for some unrecorded mistake or other major offense typically resulting in exile, as somebody with his name and the seldom given then rank of Count - Gundisalvus comes - appears signing royal documents at the Court of Navarre between the years 924 and 930, the year that his son was given the authority of Count alone. Previously, his wife Munia Donna (or Muniadona) appears holding the patrimony estates and county regency during the minority of their son Fernan Gonzalez.<br>
His remains were laid to rest in a vault at San Pedro de Arlanza, as Friar Antonio de Yepes registers in his "General Chronicle".<br>

Muña Mayor Sánchez DE CASTILE
<p>
<a name ="I007720"><b>[I007720]</b></a><br />
Mayor of Castile (died 1032 or after 1066) was queen of Navarre. She was originally called Muniadona (or Muñadona) and is variously called Munia (or Muña) Mayor (or just Munia  or Muña). In Spanish, she is called Muniadona de Castilla. It is said that her husband Sancho III of Navarre (Sancho the Great) renamed her from her contemporary name Muniadona to Mayor, for she was the eldest in her family, yet since she had an aunt of the same name, the story is clearly apocryphal. She was the daughter of Count Sancho Garcı́a of Castile. Her marriage to Sancho made her Queen consort of Navarre.<br>
In 1029, the Count Garcı́a Sánchez of Castile, Mayor's brother, was assassinated by the Vela family, Castilian exiles in León. Mayor's husband, Sancho the Great, claimed his role as feudal overlord to pass the county to their second son, Ferdinand. Likewise this brought a nominal legitimate claim to the counties of Ribagorza and Sobrarbe to her husband, who has already taken control of them militarily.<br>
Mayor was the mother of four sons and perhaps two daughters:<br>
<br>
    * King Garcı́a Sánchez III of Navarre<br>
    * Ferdinand the Great, king of León and Castile<br>
    * Ramiro, known from a 1020 charter that also names his brother Garcı́a and half-brother Ramiro I of Aragon<br>
    * Gonzalo of Sobrarbe and Ribagorza<br>
    * Bernardo<br>
    * Jimena, wife of Bermudo III of León<br>
    * Mayor, wife of Pons of Toulouse<br>
</p>
Sancha DE CASTILE
<p>
<a name ="I007516"><b>[I007516]</b></a><br />
Sancha of Castile, was the only surviving child of King Alfonso VII of Castile by his second queen, Richeza of Poland, who was the daughter of Vladislav II, Duke of Silesia.<br>
On January 18, 1174 in Saragossa she married King Alfonso II of Aragon. They had 9 children, but only seven would survive into adulthood:<br>
Constance of Aragon, married King Imre of Hungary and later, Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor<br>
Leonor, married Count Raymond VI of Toulouse<br>
Peter II of Aragon (I of Barcelona), b. 1174, killed at the Battle of Muret, September 12, 1213<br>
Dolça (nun)<br>
Alfonso II, Count of Provence, b. 1180, d. 1209<br>
Fernando, Abbot of Montearagon, d. after 1227<br>
Ramon Berenguer, d. in the 1190s<br>
A patroness of troubadours such as Giraud de Calanson and Peire Raymond, the queen became involved in a legal dispute with her husband concerning properties which formed part of her dower estates. In 1177 she entered the county of Ribagorza and took forcible possession of various castles and fortresses which had belonged to the crown there.<br>
After her husband died at Perpignan in 1196, Sancha was relegated to the background of political affairs by her son Pedro II, and she retired from court, withdrawing to the abbey of Nuestra Senora, at Sijena, which she had founded. There she assumed the cross of the Order of St John of Jerusalem which she wore till the end of her life. The queen mother entertained her widowed daughter Queen Constanza of Hungary (1179-1222) at Sijena prior to her leaving Aragon for her marriage with the emperor Frederick II in 1208. She died soon afterwards, aged fifty-four, and was interred before the high altar of the church at Sijena.<br>
</p>
Sancho Garcia I DE CASTILE
<p>
<a name ="I007673"><b>[I007673]</b></a><br />
Sancho was the son of count Garcı́a Fernández and his wife Aba of Ribagorza. He rebelled against his father with the support of Al-Mansur of Córdoba. This resulted in the partition of the county between father and son, and the county was not reunited until his father's death five years later. He renewed the Reconquista  by rebelling against Almanzor, alongside Garcı́a Sánchez II of Pamplona  and Garcı́a Gómez of the Banu Gómez. Sancho led the coalition that was defeated at the Battle of Cervera in July 1000, but in early September successfully turned back the Córdoban invasion of his county. Almanzor was again campaigning against Sancho in 1002 when another battle occurred, remembered by the Christians as the Battle of Calatañazor and Muslims as the Pedroso expedition. The two sides report different outcomes to the battle itself, but Almanzor died of injuries received in the conflict, removing Sancho's primary antagonist and leaving the Caliphate of Córdoba in crisis. Sancho ruled for another 15 years, and was succeeded by his own son Garcı́a.<br>
[edit] Family and issue<br>
His wife was named Urraca, whose appears to have been his cousin, the daughter of count Gómez Dı́az of Saldaña, head of the Beni Gómez family, by Muniadona Fernández of Castile. They had:<br>
    * Muniadona Mayor, eldest daughter, married Sancho III of Navarre, through whom right to the county eventually passed.<br>
    * Ferdinand, died before 2 March 999<br>
    * Tigridia, abbess of San Salvador de Oña, which he founded for her to direct.<br>
    * Sancha, married Berenguer Ramon I, Count of Barcelona<br>
    * Garcı́a, who succeeded his father<br>
They may also have been parents of:<br>
    * Urraca, wife of Sancho VI William of Gascony<br>

Urraca Alfonsez DE CASTILE
<p>
<a name ="I007703"><b>[I007703]</b></a><br />
From Wikipedia<br>
<br>
Urraca of Castile (1082 - March 8, 1129) was Queen of Castile and León from 1109 to her death. She was the daughter of Alfonso VI of Castile by his second wife, Constance of Burgundy. She became heiress to her father's kingdom after her only brother was killed at the battle of Ucles in 1108.<br>
<br>
She had been married as a child to Raymond of Burgundy, who died in September 1107. They had two small children: Infante Alfonso Ramı́rez (born 1104) and the Infanta Sancha (born before 1095). Now a widow, Urraca was ruler of Galicia. She was also her father's only surviving legitimate child, and now the heiress to Castile. King Alfonso VI selected a a new husband for her, and his choice fell on Alfonso I of Aragon. Urraca and Alfonso of Aragon were married in 1109.<br>
<br>
Alfonso was renowned as a great warrior; according to the chronicler Ibn al-Athir, he once remarked that a real soldier lives with men, not with women. Urraca accused him of being physically abusive to her, and their inability to produce a child created a further rift between them. She took a lover, Count Gómez González, and the royal couple were separated by 1111.<br>
<br>
Her reign was disturbed by strife among the powerful nobles and especially by constant warfare with her husband, who had seized her lands. Their marriage was annulled in 1114, and Urraca never remarried, though she took several lovers. Another thorn in her side was her brother-in-law Henry, the husband of her half-sister Teresa of Leon. He alternatively allied with Alfonso I of Aragon, then betrayed Alfonso a better offer came from Urraca's court. After his death in 1112 his widow Teresa still contested ownership of lands with Urraca. With the aid of her son, Alfonso Raimúndez, Urraca was able to win back much of her domain and ruled successfully for many years.<br>
<br>
According to the Chronicon Compostellanum, Urraca died in childbirth in 1126. The father was her lover, Count Pedro González of Lara. She was succeeded by her legitimate son, Alfonso VII.<br>

Urraca Fernández DE CASTILE
<p>
<a name ="I015141"><b>[I015141]</b></a><br />
Urraca Fernández (died 1007), infanta of Castile and daughter of Count Fernán González, was the queen consort of two Kings of León and one King of Navarre between 951 and 994. She acted as regent for her son Gonzalo, who had been given the County of Aragon, and later was co-regent of the Kingdom of Navarre, along with her daughter-in-law Jimena Fernández and the bishops of Navarre, of her grandson Sancho III.<br>
<br>
She was first married by her father to Ordoño III of León in 951. Fernán's support of Sancho the Fat cost her her husband's affection and she was repudiated in 956. By him she had two, and possibly three children:<br>
<br>
    * Ordoño, who died young<br>
    * Theresa, who became a nun<br>
    * (perhaps) Bermudo II of León, whose maternity is subject to scholarly debate<br>
<br>
In 958, after Ordoño's death, she was remarried to Ordoño IV. He died in 960.<br>
<br>
Her third and most important marriage was contracted in 962 to Sancho II of Pamplona. Both Sancho and Urraca were grandchildren of Sancho I of Pamplona, because Urraca's mother was Sancho I's daughter Sancha. With Sancho, she had several children:<br>
<br>
    * Garcı́a Sánchez II of Pamplona<br>
    * Ramiro (died 992)<br>
    * Gonzalo, who ruled the County of Aragon with Urraca as regent<br>
    * Abda (Urraca) the Basque, given to Almanzor before entering a convent<br>
