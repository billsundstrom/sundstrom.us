Soon after their son Rick married in 1981, they decided to return to Fairbanks to stay. They built a small frame home in the Rosie Creek area, in close proximity to family. About three years ago, they moved in with Rick and Sue because of declining health. It has been a blessing for those of us who got the chance to spend more time with him near the end of his life.<br>
