The Teacher on Altappen.<br>
Teacher Lydia Sundstöm was a sister of farmer and writer Nils Fredrik Sundström in Hertsön and the daughter of legendary Nils Petter Sundström (Captain Balaklava) from Luleå and Hertsön. <br>
Lydia was born in 1865. She received her teacher's education in Gammelstad and passed her teacher's exam in 1883. At that time a teacher's education alternated between Öjebyn and Gammelstad. Every second year the education took place in Öjebyn and then Gammelstad.<br>
She was employed as a teacher on the island Altappen, situated at the mouth of the Lule river, probably the year after her exam. In 1891 she took a years leave of absence and traveled by boat to Stockholm to continue her eduction at a school of household management.<br>
Her well wrtten letters to her relatives in Luleå during her stay in Stockholm are still kept by her relatives. In her letters she describes, in a lyrical way and with feeling and exactness, her stay at the school and all the things she learned there.<br>
The next year she returned to duty as a teacher on Altappen and taught school there until 1908 when a disastrous fire devastated the island. All the industrial buildings and the homes were totally destroyed. The only buildings that were saved were the school and builder's villa (Managing Directors residence). 500 persons lost their jobs, their homes and their belongings.<br>
After the fire, Lydia moved to Luleå and set up a home in Kungsgatan 26. (Kings street #26). and taught school at Östra Skolan (East school) until 1925. She died in 1947.<br>
From Luleå newspaper NSD in Sweden 16 April 2008. It was translated by Gunilla Sundstrom.<br>

The original article in Swedish:<br>
<br>
Lärarinnan på Altappen<br>
Lärarinnan Lydia Sundström var syster till jordbrukaren och skribenten Nils Fredrik Sundström i Hertsön och således dotter till legendariska sjökaptenen Nils Petter Sundström (Kapten Balaklava) från Luleå och Hertsön.<br>
Lydia föddes 1865. Hon fick sin lärarutbildning i Gammelstad där hon tog sin lärarexamen 1883. Vid den tiden fanns en ambulerande lärarutbildning mellan Öjebyn och Gammelstad. Vartannat år i Öjebyn och vartannat i Gammelstad.<br>
Hon anställdes som lärare på ön Altappen i Luleåälvens mynning, troligen året efter examen. 1891 tog hon tjänstledigt och reste med båt till Stockholm för att vidareutbilda sig under ett år på en hushållsskola.<br>
Hennes välformulerade brev hem till anhöriga i Luleå under Stockholmsvistelsen finns bevarade i släkten. I breven berättar hon lyriskt med inlevelse och noggrannhet om sin vistelse på skolan och allt hon fick lära sig där.<br>
Året därpå återvände hon till sin tjänst på Altappen och arbetade där fram till 1908 då en förödande brand ödelade ön. Alla industribyggnader och bostadshus jämnades med marken sånär som på skolan och byggmästarvillan och 500 människor blev arbetslösa och utblottade på husrum och ägodelar.<br>
Efter branden bosatte sig Lydia på Kungsgatan 26 i Luleå och tjänstgjorde på Östra skolan fram till 1925. Hon avled 1947.<br>

Comments made by Gunilla regarding above article.<br>
<br>
Altappen is a small island close to Luleå. A large saw mill on the island employed quite a lot of people. The school was managed by the saw mill company. The saw mill caught fire on July 3, 1908 and the whole island was left in ruins.<br>
"Captain Balaklava", N.P. Sundström, sea captain from Luleå was given the name of honor "Captain Balaklava" when, during the Crimean War, he was able to, on his own ship, import cargo into the Black Sea.<br>
Öjebyn was the old city Piteå, 50 kilometers south of Luleå. Öjebyn has, like Gammelstad, an old church and some church cottages.<br>
Östra skolan is a huge school building inLuleå, built in 1901, and still in use. My mother went to school there in 1919.<br>

Dear Bill,<br>
Last Feb. I received a letter from Gunilla with the information about the man in the picture, Skipper Nils Petter Sundsrom know as "Kapten Balaklava"". (1818-1878).  The following comments are from her letter.<br>
I visit the local library frequently and last week I looked through a book called "Luleå-yearbook-2007", a new book that is published every year by the archives of the city of Luleå. The book contains articles and photos/ pictures of Luleå and its inhabitants in the old day. Quite interesting! I found this picture of N.P.Sundstrom in one of the yearbooks. N.P. Sundstrom was a sea captain and should fit in somewhere in our genealogy. I believe he was the grandfather of Magnhild Östling, the little old lady you met at the family dinner here in Gammelstad in 1992. Magnhild had a picture of the Nils Petterʼs ship on the wall in her drawing room. She told me a story about N. P. that must have happened in the middle of the 19th century.<br>
The summer had been cold and very short, frost came early and failure of crops resulted in lack of food. When spring came the food supply was more or less finished, people were starving and famine was just around the corner. On top of all of this misfortune the weather continued being winter like and the Gulf of Bothnia stayed frozen until midsummer. When the ice eventually started breaking up lots of people came down to the harbor every day to see if any ship was approaching. One morning a ship could, with the help of binoculars, be seen at the horizon. The approaching ship was the first one to arrive since fall and it had a cargo of grain onboard and the skipper was N.P.S. When the ship arrived at the Luleå harbor the skipper and his crew, were heralded like heroes.<br>
Magnhild also told me that her grandmother had accompanied Nils on a couple of his voyages to England when they were newly married. After their first child was born she had to stay at home.<br>
I read in the yearbook that Nils built a house on Luleå and opened a food store in their house. He was nick named "Balaklave" because he liked to tell people about his sea adventures and especially his most adventurous voyage, the one when his ship came close to the fight at Balaklava (Crimea 1854-55). <br>
Nils, later, after having permanently gone ashore, bought a farm at Hertsön, a few miles north of Luleå. Some of his descendants still live there. <br>
In an email you sent me last August you had a website in Sweden that I tried but its in Swedish and I canʼt translate the information. I would like to find N.P. Sʼs parents and see how he is related. Let me know what you find.<br>
