Faith WHITAKER
<p>
<a name ="I084889"><b>[I084889]</b></a><br />
Faith Olson, member of Claremont (CA) Monthly Meeting, was the youngest of her parents' six children (including an adopted Chinese sister) and was born on June 20, 1925 in Lintsing, Shantung, China where she spent the first five years of her life (speaking mostly Chinese). Her parents, Robert Burdette Whitaker and Louise Gulick Whitaker, were medical missionaries. Faith went again to China with her family during her high school years, and in 1947 graduated from Oberlin College, following in the footsteps of her mother and grandmother. Subsequently, she went to nursing school, after which she lived for several years in the San Francisco Bay Area.<br>
From 1952-57, she served as a missionary in Korea, where she worked as a Lab Technician in a hospital used by the missionaries serving there, some of whom she later knew at Pilgrim Place in Claremont after she was retired. She continued her work as a Medical Lab Technologist through the early 1990s.<br>
She married Robert Allen ("Bob") Olson, an accomplished amateur pianist and composer, on July 4, 1963 in Los Angeles. As older-than-usual parents, they joyously welcomed the birth of their son, Nels, in 1966. Bob's piano playing filled their household with joy on a daily basis. He was sight-impaired and among the jobs he held, supported by Faith, was management of courthouse food concessions, a position reserved in some jurisdictions for the sight impaired. The Olsons lived in several communities in Southern California and Oregon until Bobʼs death in 1990.<br>
In the 1970s and 80s, Faith was a member of the Pacific Ackworth Friends Meeting in the Temple City, CA area. She became friends with John and Alice Way, founders of the Pacific Ackworth Friends School (in those years a K-8 school), which Nels felt fortunate to attend from 5th through 8th grade. During this period, Faith became active in RESULTS, a group that lobbies for legislation on hunger issues, and she remained active in this work for many years, joined by numerous friends, both when she lived in Oregon and later in Claremont.<br>
Faith retired to Mount San Antonio Gardens in Pomona/Claremont in 1996, where she began attending Claremont Friends Meeting, occasionally accompanied by her sister and brother-in-law, Frances and Ed Riggs, who lived, until their deaths, nearby at Pilgrim Place in Claremont. Faith quickly became active with Claremont Friends as well as with community causes, especially the Council of Churches Hunger Project. She also aided the Braille Institute doing transcription for the blind. One of her personal joys was playing her small organ.<br>
Faith was welcomed into membership of Claremont Meeting on July 29, 1999 and she continued her service on the Fellowship, Discussion, Peace and Social Order, and/or Library committees (usually on more than one committee each year!) until advancing age curtailed her activities with Friends. Her gentle spirit and quiet presence have been greatly missed in recent years as health issues prevented her attendance at meeting for worship.<br>
She died comfortably in her sleep on July 8, 2012 with Nels at  her side, and shortly thereafter Friends participated in a memorial gathering at Oak Tree Lodge, her most recent residence at Mount San Antonio Gardens. She is survived by her son and his wife, Ellen Lewis, of Berkeley, CA and by cousins, nieces and nephews widely scattered across the United States.<br>

<p>
<a name ="I084886"><b>[I084886]</b></a><br />

Returning to the United States, she later met and married Lewis Balch in Washington state eventually settling in New Mexico. Juliet was a devoted wife and mother until her death on September 11, 1998. Juliet is survived by her husband of 60 years, Lewis Balch, sons, John Balch and his wife, Beth, Bill Balch and his wife, Kathleen, Thomas Balch and his wife, Julie, Russell Balch and Richard Balch, daughters, Mary Smith and her husband, Allen and Ann Balch, nine grandchildren, sisters, Faith Olsen, Frances Riggs and other family and friends.

Louis Eugene WHITAKER
<p>
<a name ="I084887"><b>[I084887]</b></a><br />
In Remembrance - Louis Eugene Whitaker <br>
 In the chapel of the United Church of Canada, Ch'engtu, Szu Ch'uan, on Sept. 10, there took place the funeral of a young man who had laid down his life in the cause of relief and comfort to the victims of destruction in interior China. Again in Peking on the afternoon of September 18, a company of friends met in the Union church, of which he was a member, to remind themselves of the recent passing of this young life of twenty-five years. Though brief, this life was rounded out in inland China under circumstances worthy of carefully studied words of eulogy. <br>
 Louis Eugene was so named out of the respect of his parents for two great men, one renowned as a scientist, Louis Agassiz; and one respected as a Christian gentle- man of finest devotion to the cause of the poor and op- pressed in the world of labor, Eugene V. Debs. <br>
 Louis was in the North China American School at Tungchou about ten years ago. There he showed an adventurous spirit and love of nature-hikes. From the Jefferson Academy taxidermist he learned to mount natural history specimens of skins and skeletons and later in college helped support himself by taxidermy work, as did the writer in his time. <br>
 He finished college at Oregon State in Corvallis, Oregon, with the class of 1938, majoring in geology and mineralogy. The next year he engaged to teach classes in the Peking American School and did so for a few months. A schoolmate at Tungchou, Howard Sollenberger, brought out from Shansi thrilling stories of the need for help and opportunity for distributing relief sent out from England and America. This fired his imagination, appealed to his love of adventure and touched his outgoing sympathy for the needy in this land of his parents' adoption. Nothing could dissuade him from going as companion to his schoolmate. <br>
 So he had to make arrangements for the Peking American School and gather a small winter travel out- fit. This included the borrowing of a sheepskin sleeping bag given the writer after a Roy Chapman Andrews Mongolian expedition, a book on the birds of the region, and a pair of binoculars for their study. This he split and took but one barrel of the binoculars to save space and weight in his baggage. He wrote that they identified some rare birds and had to burn the sleeping bag after it became infected with the typhus carrying cooties. <br>
 They had to return to Shanghai before starting and there Louis had an appendectomy. He also took the inoculations for typhus and other dreaded diseases they were liable to encounter. Before being fully recovered, they set out for the interior and they did their work, interrupted for a time by a siege of the typhus, of lighter form because of their preventive measures, yet still a horrible disease. <br>
 On their attempted return to the coast, they were held up on the west bank of the Han River above Hankow by the flood that came down the night of their arrival there at its bank. There was no crossing it, and for a long time, the way behind was also closed by the waters. Finally, backtracking, they reached Chengtu where they stayed to put flesh on their bones before attempting again the arduous journey to the coast. But before that could be accomplished, Louis' body, weakened by hardship, disease and diet among the people of scanty cereals diluted with tree leaves, succumbed to an attack of typhoid and accompanying pneumonia. <br>
 Born August 15, 1915, in Oakland, Calif., just before his parents came to China, Louis grew up in China. In Hawaii, during a furlough visit, he joined the Central Union church under Rev. Philip Schwartz, formerly of Peking. He transferred to the Freewater Federated church, Oregon, while in college where his father was pastor and then became an associate member of Union Church in Peking. <br>
 We may be sure that he "looked to Jesus, the author and finisher of our faith," for support in those trying months in red China; and that he shared with his Lord in that "joy set before him" of knowing that his sacrifice of life in suffering was not in vain, but that it brought him a good conscience, the approval of fellow men and of his Master because it was for the salvation of men.<br>
