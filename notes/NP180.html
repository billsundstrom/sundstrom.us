Edmund FITZALAN

From Wikipedia<br>
<br>
Edmund FitzAlan, 9th Earl of Arundel (May 1, 1285 - November 17, 1326) was an English nobleman prominent in the contention between Edward II and his barons and second de facto Earl of the FitzAlan line. He was born 1 May 1285 in the Castle of Marlborough. He was the son of Richard FitzAlan, 8th Earl of Arundel and Alisia de Saluzzo (also known as Alice), daughter of Thomas I, marquis of Saluzzo in Italy. He succeeded to his father's estates and titles in 1302. He was summoned to Parliament, 9 November 1306, as Earl of Arundel, and took part in the Scottish wars of that year.<br>
<br>
Arundel bore the royal robes at Edward II's coronation, but he soon fell out with the king's favorite Piers Gaveston. In 1310 he was one of the Lords Ordainer, and he was one of the 5 earls who allied in 1312 to oust de Gaveston. Arundel resisted reconciling with the King after de Gaveston's death, and in 1314 he along with some other earls refused to help the king's Scottish campaign, which contributed in part to the English defeat at Bannockburn.<br>
<br>
A few years later Arundel allied with king Edward's new favorites, Hugh le Despenser and his son of the same name, and had his son and heir Richard married to a daughter of the younger Hugh le Despenser. He reluctantly consented to the Despenser's banishment in 1321, and joined the king's efforts to restore them in 1321. Over the following years Arundel was one of the king's principal supporters, and after the capture of Roger Mortimer in 1322 he received a large part of the forfeited Mortimer estates. He also held the two great offices governing Wales, becoming justice of Wales in 1322 and warden of the Welsh marches in 1325.<br>
<br>
After Mortimer's escape from prison and invasion of England in 1326, amongst the barons only Arundel and his brother-in-law Warenne remained loyal to the king. Their defensive efforts were ineffective, and Arundel was captured and executed at the behest of Queen Isabella.<br>
<br>
Arundel married Alice Warenne, sister and eventual heiress of John de Warenne, 8th Earl of Surrey or Warenne and daughter of William de Warenne and Joan de Vere. Alice was living in 1330 but died before 23 May 1338. His estates and titles were forfeited when was executed, but they were eventually restored to his eldest son Richard FitzAlan, 10th Earl of Arundel.<br>

<a name ="I008477"><b>[I008477]</b></a><br />
John FitzAlan, 7th Earl of Arundel (14 September 1246, Arundel, Sussex, England - 18 March 1272) was an English nobleman. He was the son of John FitzAlan, 6th Earl of Arundel (d. 1267), and Isabel d'Aubigny, daughter of William d'Aubigny, 4th Earl of Arundel.<br>
<br>
Arundel married Isabella de Mortimer, daughter of Roger Mortimer, 1st Baron Wigmore, in 1260. They had at least two children - Richard Fitzalan and Eleanor Fitzalan. Arundel's titles also included Baron of Clun and Oswestry.<br>

John FitzAlan (1223-1267), Lord Oswestry, Clun, and Arundel, was an English nobleman. He is sometimes counted as 6th Earl of Arundel, although he was never called earl during his lifetime. He married Maude le Botiller, daughter of Theobald le Botiller and Rhese de Verdon.<br>
<br>
He was the son of John Fitzalan, Lord of Oswestry, from whom he inherited a great estate in Shropshire, and Isabel d'Aubigny, daughter of William d'Aubigny, 4th Earl of Arundel. After the death without direct heirs of his mother's brother Hugh d'Aubigny, 5th Earl of Arundel, he inherited a quarter of the earl's estate, including Arundel.<br>
<br>
Arundel vacillated in the conflicts between Henry III and the barons. He fought on the king's side at the Battle of Lewes, where he was taken prisoner. On 26 May 1244, he obtained possession of his paternal estates in Shropshire.<br>
<br>
John and Maude had a son John Fitzalan, 7th Earl of Arundel.<br>
</p>
Richard FITZALAN
<p>
<a name ="I095539"><b>[I095539]</b></a><br />
From Wikipedia<br>
<br>
Richard FitzAlan, 10th Earl of Arundel (c. 1313-January 24, 1376) was an English nobleman and military leader.<br>
<br>
Fitzalan was the eldest son of Edmund FitzAlan, 9th Earl of Arundel, and Alice Warenne. His birthdate is uncertain, but could not have been before 1307. Around 1321, FitzAlan's father allied with King Edward II's favorites, the Hugh le Despenser, 1st Earl of Winchester and his namesake son, and Richard was married to the daughter of Hugh the Younger. Fortune turned against the Despenser party, and in 1326, FitzAlan's father was executed, and he did not succeed to his father's estates or titles.<br>
<br>
However, political conditions had changed by 1330, and over the next few years Richard was gradually able to reacquire the Earl of Arundel as well as the great estates his father had held in Sussex and in the Welsh Marches. Beyond this, in 1334 he was made justice of North Wales (later his term in this office was made for life), sheriff for life of Caernarvonshire, and governor of Caernarfon Castle.<br>
<br>
Despite his high offices in Wales, in the following decades Arundel spent much of his time fighting in Scotland (during the Second Wars of Scottish Independence) and France (during the Hundred Years' War). In 1337, Arundel was made joint commander of the English army in the north, and the next year he was made the sole commander.<br>
<br>
In 1340 he fought at the Battle of Sluys, and then at the siege of Tournai. After a short term as warden of the Scottish Marches, he returned to the continent, where he fought in a number of campaigns, and was appointed Joint Lieutanant of Aquitaine in 1340.<br>
<br>
Arundel was one of the three principal English commanders at the Battle of Crécy. He spent much of the following years on various military campaigns and diplomatic missions.<br>
<br>
In 1353 he succeeded to the Earldom of Surrey (or Warenne), which even further increased his great wealth. (He did not however use the additional title until after the death of the Dowager Countess of Surrey in 1361.) He made very large loans to King Edward III but even so on his death left behind a great sum in hard cash.<br>
<br>
Arundel married twice. His first wife (as mentioned above), was Isabella Despenser. He repudiated her, and had the marriage annulled on the grounds that he had never freely consented to it. After the annulment he married Eleanor of Lancaster, daughter of Henry, 3rd Earl of Lancaster and Maud Chaworth.<br>
<br>
By his first marriage he had one daughter. By the second he had 3 sons: Richard, who succeeded him as Earl; John Fitzalan, who was a Marshall of England, and drowned in 1379; and Thomas Arundel, who became Archbishop of Canterbury. He also had 2 surviving daughters by his second wife: Joan, who married Humphrey de Bohun, 7th Earl of Hereford, and Alice, who married Thomas Holland, 2nd Earl of Kent.<br>
