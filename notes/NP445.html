A Great Man, Remembered By Many<br>
Stan Clarke: Feb 7,1914 - Feb 13, 2010<br>
by Chris Clarke<br>
Stan was born in Fort William, Ontario and had moved out to Lethbridge from after many years as a radio operator in the Ontario bush. His radio communications had guided and landed many bush planes and commercial ventures during this time. He was hired by Trans Canada Airlines which later turned into Air Canada. Stan was with Air Canada until he retired in 1972.<br>
While he was with Trans Canada Air, he began to paint in oils, and the legacy began . . . Stan Clarke was introduced to the arts in the early 1950's when he met Jean Reagh while moonlighting at a flower shop in Lethbridge Alberta. Jean had attended Alberta College of Art and the Chicago Art Institute. Stan and Jean moved to Vancouver and set up Reagh Studios and sold ceramics and supplies. Stan's contemporaries were Bill Reid, Tony Onely and Gathy Faulk among many others. He exhibited as a portrait painter and a jeweler, working in silver and enamel.<br>
He was in on the start of the BC Potters guild and began to moonlight at the UBC Potter's hut teaching in the extension department while working for Air Canada and as well designing the award winning flight dispatcher's office at the 'new' Vancouver airport. He spent some time with the great potter Bernard Leach in England.<br>
In 1956 the Clarkes moved to Surrey and set up a pottery and sculpture studio, producing work there for many years in the old chicken houses, firing the oil kiln only at night as not to distress the neighbors' with the black clouds! Stan retired from Air Canada and set up Greenbarn Pottery Supply at the farm. During this time Stan attended a World Craft council meeting in Britain and was bitten by the studio glass bug, he learned about blowing glass by studying with George Elliott and also spent time at the Glass House in London. On return to Canada, he set up a hot glass shop in the early '70's and exhibited from then on.<br>
Stan was always generous with his knowledge and many potters and glass blowers benefited from his advice. He could tell you how to set up a kiln, encouraged those to build a kiln themselves rather than buy one and could tell you how to adjust a glaze that wasn't working out. When his daughter Chris returned from both Alberta College of Art and the Glass Centre in England, she kicked him out of his glass studio, this was when Stan decided to start turning wood. This was a great time for him and he enjoyed the friends in the wood clubs and pleased many with his creations.<br>
Stan retired from Greenbarn at the age of 92, selling up the old farm where he had spent over 50 years. He set up a wood shop in his new home and received the 'Civic Treasure' award from the City of Surrey in 2008. Stan and Jean had always had lively discussions on Art vs Craft, and it was always entertaining if a roast was cooked in the kiln and forgotten and reduced to ashes, or wine was mulled by a hot poker in the glory hole of the glass studio. Famous people have had their Lincolns danced on by goats and investigated by cats(Uncle Ben and Harry Adaskin). But every one was welcome and entertained by the antics of the various animals that populated the farm. Stan Clarke was a renaissance man of our times, curious, hungry for knowledge and a great fan of musical theatre. He had a great circle of friends and was much loved by Bacon and Van, Bull Terriers that he loved dearly, and they loved him. Bacon was at the Bridge to meet him and sadly for Chris, Van followed Stan a few days later, onto this new chapter.<br>
