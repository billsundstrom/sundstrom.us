On April 8, 2016, Skip peacefully passed away in his sleep at home while surrounded by his loving family, after bravely and courageously battling cancer for over 2 years.

After many adventures and cities, Skip, Kathy, and their two children Michelle and J.J., moved to the Sacramento area in 1985.

I will see you in my dreams; God bless you, baby. Yours forever, Bosco (Kathy) Dad, you are my anchor and I will love you until the seas run dry. I will miss you every day for the rest of my life. I am who I am because of the love and support you and mom have given me. Love forever, Your Baby Girl (Michelle) Dad, thank you for my example of the best dad and showing me unconditional love. You have helped me be the best dad I can be. I cannot wait to see the lessons you have for me in the years to come. Thank you Pop! Always Remembered, Never Forgotten!
