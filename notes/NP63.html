William R. BULLOCK
<p>
<a name ="I062358"><b>[I062358]</b></a><br />
William R. Bullock, seems to have been the eldest child of William and Mary Bullock, who were both born in England. William R, like his sisters appears to have been born in Erie County, in New York. By 1860 the census records show that his parents had moved their family to the Town of Kingston, Green Lake County, Wisconsin.<br>
Kinston seems to be about 20 miles from Scott, in Columbia Wisconsin, where Rosina Inglehart, were living. Rosina Inglehart, was born, in Ohio, I think in Geneva, which is in Ashtabula County, there. Her family seems to have moved to Scott, after her birth in the mid 1840's. That is where the rest of her siblings were born and her parents lived out their lives. Her Dad seems to have been a grocer there. <br>

Laurel Patricia Ann Hutchens of Onalaska was called home to the Lord on Wednesday, March 10, 2004, while visiting her daughter and son in Florida.<br>
Laurel was born Oct. 15, 1931, to Lloyd and Birdie (Haney) Burch. She married Roger Hutchens on Sept. 10, 1949, at Johnny Cake United Church of Christ in Billings Creek, rural Ontario, Wis. Roger passed away May 15, 1995.<br>
Laurel loved life, making people happy and having fun. Her life overflowed with compassion for others. Her love and devotion for the care of her daughter Cindy was unending. She was quickly at the side of family members and friends when illness or other needs arose. Her own needs were often set aside for the needs of others.<br>
Laurel was well known for her creativity. She seldom did a task part way. Her talent for sewing resulted in projects for bridesmaid dresses, square dance outfits, special occasion attire, furniture upholstering and a variety of other requests. Given a theme or idea, she would create an entire roomful of elaborate decorations for a class reunion or camping rally. She was always searching for the missing pieces of her next project. She loved camping and traveling. She had a quick wit and wonderful sense of humor.<br>
Laurel was a member of the Relax-In Campers, and a member of the board of directors of the Badger Chapter of the Family Motor Coach Association. She helped establish the Purple Petunias Chapter of the Red Hat Society and was known as the chapter "Hysterian." Laurel was a member of the Esther Circle at the Onalaska United Methodist Church and of the Eastern Star. She regularly filled her mornings with exercise, coffee and camaraderie as a mall walker. She loved to dance and was active in the Pistols and Petticoats and Coulee Promenaders until the loss of her husband.<br>

In Memoriam<br>
RALPH BURCHAM<br>
1924-1963<br>
Ralph Burcham, the Archivist of the State of Washington, suffered a fatal heart attack on November 9, 1963. He had been ailing for some months. Dr. Burcham was 39 years old.<br>
Born in Rittman, Ohio, on March 13, 1924, Ralph was a member of a large family that was hard hit by the depression years in that industrial city. He completed high school there and during World War II was inducted into the United States Army. Serving in the European Theater, he was invalided home before the war's end.<br>
As a disabled veteran, Ralph was able to pursue his education. He moved west and took his B.A. degree at the University of Idaho in 1950. Pursuing his newfound interest in western history, he transferred to Washington State College (now University) at Pullman and worked toward his doctorate under Prof. Herman Deutsch.<br>
In January 1953 Ralph accepted an appointment as Assistant State Archivist in Olympia. I had been appointed Archivist 18 months earlier, and together-despite the inadequacy of statutory authority for the job at hand- we surveyed a vast collection of unclassified records that had been accumulating over the years with no professional care.<br>
For a number of years we worked principally as stevedores and microfilm operators. Ralph accepted this in good part and pressed forward this work. In 1957 we lobbied through the legislature the present records management law and began to catch up on the backlog of work<br>
Ralph took his doctorate in 1957, writing on the gold rush era on the Clearwater. In 1958 he became State Archivist, and in 1963, just a few months before his death, he saw the State archives moved into a new building for which he had done much of the planning.<br>
Ralph was active in the Society of American Archivists and in his work with historical and library agencies in Washington. It was his aim to make the Washington State Archives a useful agency for historical research, something it had not achieved in the past. His acquaintance with official records of the State, especially with respect to their origins and arrangement, will be sorely missed by the agencies.<br>
Dr. Burcham is survived by his wife, Beverly Freeburg Burcham, who is on the teaching staff of an Olympia school; a son, Randall, who is a student at Washington State University; a daughter, Sally Jean, who attends Tumwater High School; his youngest son, Jonathan, a student at a Tumwater grade school, and a baby daughter, Robin.<br>
