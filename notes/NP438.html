<a name ="I097174"><b>[I097174]</b></a><br />
Alice secondly married 26 November 1994 to Charles T. Whitley at Seattle.<br>
-------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
Our beloved mother, teacher, advisor and lifelong baseball fan passed away peacefully into heaven surrounded by family on Wednesday, June 13, at the age of 95.<br>
Alice grew up on the family farm in McLeod, North Dakota, the youngest of four children. She graduated from Lisbon High School in 1941 and married the boy next door, Everett Olerud, the same year. They married at Elbow Lake, Minnesota. Over the next 23 years, Everett and Alice welcomed five children: Sharon, John, Cathy, Janna and Jodi. Being a wife and a mother wasn't just a part of Alice's life, it was the fulfillment of her biggest hope and dream. She was loving and playful, caring and deeply committed to family. She supported Everett in all his endeavors, including a three-year deployment during World War II, as she stayed behind with young Sharon and John.<br>
They relocated their family several times between Washington State and Lisbon/McLeod, ND. Everett started a propane gas business in Washington, owned the Sand Dune Saloon in McLeod and was Sherriff of Ransom County in Lisbon for several years with Alice "blooming where she was planted". In later years, Alice and Everett worked as condominium managers at several locations including: Mariner Manor in Des Moines, Washington, where they touched the lives of many. Everett preceded her in death in 1991.<br>
She loved baseball and had the good fortune to follow the exploits of her husband Everett's McLeod town team, her son John's college and 7-year professional baseball career as well as her grandson, John's college and 17-year major league career. She was able to attend 2 World Series, 2 All Star games, and many playoff series in which John participated. She learned to use the computer, so she could follow young John's games when she traveled. In later years she traveled with her son, John, to the Roy Hobbs Senior Baseball World Series in Ft. Myers, FL for many championships and many great friendships.<br>
In 1994, Alice married Charles "Chuck" Whitley. They shared a love for travel and adventure, and adventures they had. The couple hauled RVs across the United States, driving upwards of 50,000 miles. They enjoyed many happy years together, traveling, reading, sharing stories and watching ballgames. Chuck preceded her in death in 2016.<br>
Alice, or "Grandma O", loved all her grandchildren and great-grandchildren, and delighted in watching them grow up. Her family will miss her loving devotion, quick wit, sage advice and steady presence. She is survived by her children, Sharon, John (Lynda), Cathy (Dave), Janna and Jodi (Bret) and 13 grandchildren and 14 great-grandchildren.<br>
