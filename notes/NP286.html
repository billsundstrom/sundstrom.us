Dennis Michael KALLAL
<p>
<a name ="I017264"><b>[I017264]</b></a><br />
Dennis M. (Kelly) Kallal, of Chandler AZ, went home to be with the Lord, February 23, 2006 at the age of 58. His legacy continues through Jane his wife, best friend and love of his life for over 38 years, and children and grandchild. With great pride, Dennis was immersed in helping his grown children, son Joe, and daughter, Kimberly, establish themselves as contributing citizens. Dennis and his son, Joe, were in business together, and continued to grow closer through the enjoyment of many of the same recreational, sporting and career interests. To Dennis, daughter Kim was always "daddy's little girl", yet he enjoyed seeing her growth as a young adult and mother of his only grandson, Evan. Evan's birth, three years ago, opened a new and joyous chapter in Dennis' life, not only for Dennis as the doting and adoring grandfather, but also for friends and relatives who watched or participated in the special relationship Dennis had with his grandson. Evan was truly a remarkable gift in Dennis' last years on this earth. Dennis is also survived by his father and mother, George and Alvina Kallal, sister Jean and her husband Ray Greenbush, and their sons, Brad and Jeff. He was born in Faribault, MN, and raised in Lonsdale, MN. Dennis honorably served his country in the United States Air Force. He graduated from the University of Wisconsin-River Falls with a degree in Business and Economics. Dennis had a long career in sales, marketing and executive management at national and international companies in Minnesota, supplying processing equipment for the electronics industry, and later with Advanced Systems Inc. in Phoenix. Most recently, Dennis was co-founder and President of DALUX Equipment Service Corporation. Throughout his career, Dennis built international relations that spanned the globe, specifically China, Taiwan, Canada, Germany and France. In addition to his many business interests, Dennis also volunteered his time and talents to assist in the establishment and growth of the Family Involvement Center of Phoenix, a non-profit, family-driven resource and training center providing education and support activities for at-risk youth, their families and human services workers. Dennis will be remembered for his strong character, work ethic and discipline, storytelling, humor, zest for life, love of family and admired for always being available to help his friends and neighbors in time of need. Dennis also found great joy in his home and yard, continuously making improvements for his family and entertaining business and family friends at his home. Dennis also found time for his hobbies of pheasant hunting and other shooting for sport, as well as fishing, camping, billiards and golfing. He will be greatly missed by all, but his spirit and values will continue on. Visitation will be held on Thursday, March 2nd from 5:00pm-8:00pm at the Carr-Tenney Mortuary, 2621 S. Rural Rd., Tempe, AZ. Funeral Mass will be held at 9:30am, Friday, March 3rd at Our Lady of Mt. Carmel Catholic Church, 2121 S. Rural Rd., Tempe, AZ.

Ruth married Louis Fish Shank on February 6, 1943 in Little Rock, Arkansas. In 1946, Ruth began working with Margaret Curry writing a book titled The History of Platte County. This began her love of the history of Columbus and Platte County. After raising her family, Ruth returned to work full time at Loup Public Power in 1965. She was a PBX Operator/receptionist and was known as the Voice of Loup Power until her retirement in 2001 at the age of 84.

John J. KALVODA
<p>
<a name ="I022455"><b>[I022455]</b></a><br />
GLENULLIN- John "Johnny" J. Kalvoda Jr. died peacefully Dec. 22, 2005, at Marian Manor Healthcare Center, Glen Ullin, of complications from multiple sclerosis, a disease he battled more than half of his life. Services will be held 2:30 p.m. Tuesday, Dec. 27, at Christ the King Catholic Church, Mandan, with the Rev. Albert Leary officiating. Burial will follow in Mandan Union Cemetery.<br>
Visitation will be held from 1 to 9 p.m. Monday at Weigel Funeral Home, Mandan, with rosaries by Christian Mothers at 4:30 p.m. and the Knights of Columbus at 7:30 p.m., with a parish vigil at 8 p.m.. Visitation will continue one hour prior to services at the church.<br>
Johnny ("Yenda" in Czech) was born March 6, 1933, in Mandan, the son of John Sr. and Marie (Kadlec) Kalvoda. He married Lila Lee Lowman on June 26, 1963, in Bismarck, and the couple raised their family in Mandan. In 1965, he was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis, a disease that slowly reduced his ability to walk. A born farmer, he also sold real estate until 1976. His condition forced him to completely retire in 1978. By 1999, medical realities mandated a move to Marian Manor Healthcare Center, where his good-natured ribbing made him a staff favorite.<br>
He loved the land and its animals, quietly bursting with pride to help something grow, be it endless fields of wheat, the lilacs that lined his family's backyard, or the family dog, Spencer. A force of nature in younger days, Johnny was a competitive ringleader who loved to dance, hunt (including aerial), collect pens, "watch a good Western or war picture," and rollerskate (once flying out an open window). He even worked in a stock car pit crew. Friends would attend wrestling matches at the Bismarck Civic Center just to see Johnny sit in the corner and taunt the "dirty" guy. Cards and board games brought out a hilarious sore winner side, and sometimes he would "bend the rules" by speaking in Czech. He loved to share laughs about the good old days until he fell out of his chair, tears streaming down his face.<br>
But as the multiple sclerosis progressed, family and friends attempted to ease the struggle, and the later years were hard.<br>
Johnny is survived and was blessed by his wife of 42 years, Lila Lee, Mandan; son, Charlie, Round Lake, Ill.; son, Andy "Drew" and daughter-in-law, Anja, Moorhead, Minn.; daughter, Theresa, and son-in-law, Mike Porter, Bismarck; son, Mike, Los Angeles; six grandsons, Ethan and Jayden Porter, and Jacob, Jonathon, Jordan and Joseph Kalvoda; one sister and brother-in-law, Marie and Eugene Graner Sr., Bismarck; one brother and sister-in-law, E.C. (Milo) and Lois, Mandan; and a treasure of family and friends whom he thought the world of.<br>
He was preceded in death by his parents; his brother, Benedict; and his infant sister, Libby.<br>
In lieu of flowers, the family prefers memorials to the Multiple Sclerosis Society, Marian Manor Healthcare Center, and the Humane Society.<br>
