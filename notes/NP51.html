Margaretha BRAUN
<p>
<a name ="I013015"><b>[I013015]</b></a><br />
Margaretha was the daughter of Jacob and Elisabeth Braun. She married Georg Pitzer (name changed to Bitzer after immigration), who died and left her with 5 children. He was 33 at the time of his death. She then married Peter Schmitt, he was 24 years older. They had 3 children. He died between 1870 & 1880. She had no occupation, so I assume she lived with one of the Bitzer children, until Stephen's marriage in 1877. She lived with Stephen and Lizzie until her death in 1900. She contracted TB and was treated at some point in time. She is buried in Oakhill Cemetary under the name of Margharetha Braun.  Her grave stands alone.<br>

Stella M. BRAZAK
<p>
<a name ="I033540"><b>[I033540]</b></a><br />
AUBURN - With much sadness, we announce the death of our beloved mother, Stella Lipiska. Stella, 96, of State Street Road, died on Jan. 18, 2014 at the home of her daughter, Jeanne Kuhfta, with her loving devoted family at her side.<br>
Stella, the daughter of the late Thomas and Mary (Naworol) Brazak was born Feb. 4, 1917. She worked for many years at the Family Bargain Center and as a nursing assistant, retiring in 1965 from Mercy Rehab Center.<br>
Stella was the "matriarch" of the Lipiska family. Our mom was the most devoted mom a child could want. She was a very strong, generous person, who always put her children first. She drove her car until she was 91 and could be seen cutting the grass on her "power steering" riding lawnmower until she was 95. Up until the age of 94, when she had a hard time getting "back up," you would see her working in her flower beds. Each spring you would see hundreds of brightly colored tulips and daffodils adorn the yard. Stella lived independently until a few months ago, when her body grew tired and weak.<br>
Our mom was always a part of our lives; from the large family "get-togethers," picnics, recitals, graduations, and every holiday we spent together. She spent many weekends on the patio watching her children, grandchildren, and great-grandchildren "partying." Her presence and guidance will be so sadly missed.<br>
Stella was predeceased by her husband, George in 1987; her daughter, June Caruana Lipiska in 2004; her daughter-in-law, Kelly Green Lipiska in 2006; her grandson, Gregory; great-granddaughter, Emily, and her two brothers, Stanley and Teddy Brazak.<br>
Stella is survived by her loving children, Joan (Bernie) Ryan, Sue Bertonica, Jeanne Kuhfta, Tom Lipiska, Mike Lipiska, and Dave (Tammy) Lipinski; her "adopted" daughter, Sandy (Jim) Kershner, of Massachusetts. Stella also known as "Mock" by her surviving grandchildren, Kathy Zettelmoyer, Bernard Ryan, Maureen Ryan, Gina Gera, Jeffrey Bertonica, Michelle Kuhfta, Mackenzie Cunningham, Thomas and Miranda Lipiska, Sara and Andy Lipiska, Renee Munn, Jenna and Matt Lipiska. She also leaves behind 11 great-grandchildren; her two "special" nieces, Carol Jordan and Sandy Bower; her three nephews, Bobby, Todge, and Raymond Brazak.<br>
We would like to thank the Throop Fire Department, Auburn Community Hospital: ER, ICU, and 3M, Hospice, Dr. Godishala and Dr. Vounas for their many years of service to her; her companion and caregiver, Ann Murphy and Joan Scanlon. Hospice nurses and aides, Home Instead Senior Café, and Shannon Moskov and Marci at longterm care.<br>
We were so fortunate to have our mother, "The Queen" all these years. She was an inspiration to all who knew her. Her "light" will shine on forever. Until we meet again.<br>
