"My father was Carl W. Rulien and his store was Rulien Office Equipment. He started his business in Hudson in 1940. As a young girl, my friends and I also had several rummage sales in the store in the late 40s. At that time my Dadʼs business was in one large open room," she said.<br>
"He had a wonderful slogan he used on his business cards. It said, ʻ"C Rulien for your next machine.ʼ He sold, rented and repaired adding machines, typewriters and cash registers along with selling office furniture and other office equipment," McConaughey said.<br>
"Dad ran his business in Hudson until 1956, the year Gwin and Petersen purchased the building. He and my mother then moved to Florida for three years.
