<h2>Notes</h2>
Lois BERG
<p>
<a name ="I089032"><b>[I089032]</b></a><br />
Born in a little house on the North Dakota prairie, near the town of Max, Lois grew up on a farm with her father and mother, Peter and Frances Berg, and eight brothers and sisters: Gilbert, Marie, Lucille, Eleanor, Ken, Bob, Clifford and Jim. She graduated from Max High School in 1938 and attended Minot State Teachers College, earning a certificate to teach elementary school. An excellent classroom teacher, she taught in one room school houses and later at St. Paul's Elementary School in San Pablo, California, for 13 years.<br>
She married Earbon Trihub of Max in June of 1943 in San Diego where he was stationed with the Marine Corps. Following the end of World War II they lived briefly in North Dakota before making their home in Richmond, California. They had one daughter, Rhonda. Lois was a loving wife and mother, an outstanding cook and seamstress who enjoyed spending time with her extended family, helping others, gardening and reading.<br>
Both Lois and Earbon were diagnosed with long-term illnesses. In 1978 they were admitted to Roberts Nursing Home in Napa. Earbon would later live at the Veterans Home in Yountville, California, where he died in October of 1993. Lois remained at Roberts Nursing Home until it closed in 2003. She lived at Napa Valley Care Center for the past 10 years.<br>
Lois was an inspiration to all who knew her. Despite the progressive paralysis of 44 years of illness, she remained positive and engaged with her family, her friends and the larger world. Many will remember her smile and her interest in their lives. She was determined to live her life to the fullest. And she succeeded.<br>
The family wishes to extend their heartfelt gratitude to the many wonderful caregivers who took care of Lois, and loved her, for the past 35 years. Thank you, too, to the Napa Valley Hospice team, including Dr. Ronald Julis, who helped Lois to live her final weeks in dignity, free of pain and anxiety. Their compassion was extraordinary.<br>
Lois is survived by her daughter and son-in-law, Rhonda and Frank Kingman of San Francisco, five brothers and sisters: Lucille Miller (Minot, North Dakota), Eleanor Wenger (Independence, Missouri), Kenneth Berg and LaVern (Napa), Bob Berg (Garrison, North Dakota), Jim Berg and Muriel (Aurora, Colorado) and numerous nieces and nephews. She was preceded in death by her husband, Earbon, her parents, and her siblings: Gilbert Berg, Marie Rodrigues and Clifford Berg.<br>
A funeral Mass in celebration of her life will take place on Saturday, June 1st, at St. Thomas Aquinas Catholic Church at 11:00 A.M., 2725 Elm St., Napa, California.<br>

Nels Victor Eugene BERGQUIST
<p>
<a name ="I100822"><b>[I100822]</b></a><br />
els Victor Bergquist was born November 11, 1918, in Hoquaim, Washington, the first of five sons of Nels Axel and Mary (Kretz) Bergquist. He was named Victor because on that same day the Germans surrendered, marking the close of WWI. Victor lost his mother when he was nine years old. During his teenage years he had to leave school for a while to work and help support his family because of the Depression. On October 19, 1940, Victor married Esther Swanson of Aberdeen. In January of 1942 they welcomed their son, Robert. Victor served in the Army personnel office at Camp Roberts, California during WWII. He and Esther celebrated the birth of their daughter, Judith, in November of 1944. The family lived briefly in Seattle, and then moved to Bremerton in 1947. While there Victor worked as salesman and credit manager at Kitsap Radio and Appliance. He served as chairman of First Covenant Church, the Kitsap County Laymensʼ Association, and the local chapter of the Gideons, International. Esther and Victor were blessed with the coming of their son, Donald, in 1949.<br>
In 1972 Esther and Victor moved to Bellevue, where he became the Western Washington distributor for the Rexair Corporation. He convinced many that the Rainbow "not only cleaned the house but cleansed the air". His success enabled the two of them to take enjoyable trips to Europe, Hawaii, and to the various places their children and grandchildren lived. Victor and Esther were members of the Highland Covenant Church while in Bellevue, where he enjoyed singing in the church choir, as well as at the annual Julefest at First Covenant Church in Seattle.<br>
In 1997 the Bergquists became part of the community of Covenant Shores on Mercer Island. Esther played the piano and Victor led the singing at the Sunday evening vesper services, and he had a wonderful time singing in the mensʼ chorus and playing pool. Though someone else took over the distributorship, Victor continued a business of financing Rainbows into his 90ʼs, saying "he wanted to keep on working so he could keep on giving"! Esther died in 2007, yet Victor continued delivering papers every morning to people in his building and leading a weekly hymn sing in the Health Center. He died three weeks after a family celebration of his 97th birthday, having told his family they need not sorrow at "his going home".<br>
Victor was preceded in death by Esther, by his brothers Allan, Roy, Henry, and Carl, and by his sister, Betty. He is survived by his son Bob, and wife Judy; daughter Judy Matzen and husband, Greg; and by his son, Don. He also leaves his beloved grandchildren Jim, Anne, Julie, Peter, and Bill; and great-grandchildren Joshua, Harper, Morgan, Lakemoon, Ellis, Elise, Temple, Isaac, and Lucas.
