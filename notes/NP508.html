Marion Louise Snyder Gingerich, 96, of Fulton, MD, formerly of S. Main Street, Keyser, WV, passed away Saturday, June 9, 2012 at the residence of her daughter, Lorraine, by whom she has been cared for and lived with since 2004.<br>
Born on February 24, 1916 at Osceola Mills, PA, she was a daughter of the late David Jeffries and Ellen Catherine (Shoff) Snyder. She was preceded in death by her loving husband William Donald Gingerich, whom she married on September 19, 1934 in Westernport, MD. He died on September 29, 2003.

Marion lived in Pennsylvania until moving to West Virginia when she married her husband Don from Tyrone, PA. She was a stay at home mom for many years until a change at home forced her to go to work. She also had to learn to drive at the age of 50, a feat that was not easy for her. She worked for over 20 years as a kindergarten aide at the Keyser Primary-Middle School where she was known as "Mrs. G." She enjoyed seeing all of her former students around Keyser and watching them grow up. She was often spotted by former students and their parents and she loved to relive the time she had them in her kindergarten class. Marion enjoyed cooking, crafting, crocheting, gardening and especially sewing. Since all her children left Keyser, she relished the time when her family visited her from out of town. Marion also had many close friends in Keyser and was a member of several women's clubs around town. She was a long time member of the Keyser Presbyterian Church. She always had a great sense of humor and a bright outlook on life, and being a breast cancer survivor, Marion never let health problems get in her way. Even up until the age of 95, she was still walking around daily.<br>
Surviving are two daughters, Lorraine Gingerich and husband Larry Tyson of Fulton and Nancy Williams and husband Richard of Forest Hill, MD; three sons, Michael Gingerich and wife Barbara of Dumfries, VA, William F.

Leila Ethelyn SODERSTROM
<p>
<a name ="I003430"><b>[I003430]</b></a><br />
Leila Gilman passed into glory on Sunday evening, Dec. 13 at 9:33 p.m., with family at her side. Having battled pulmonary fibrosis for the past several months, her death occurred just twelve days after the passing of her husband.<br>
Leila was born on a country homestead northwest of Beresford, SD on May 27, 1930. Living on a farm during the dust-bowl years of the 30's, Leila grew up learning what hard work and making ends meet was all about. Her Christian faith was instilled and nurtured throughout her early years by her family and childhood church, Skrefsrud Lutheran. It was in this church that she was baptized, confirmed, married and commissioned to foreign missions. Leila graduated from Augustana Academy in Canton, SD in May of 1948, then attended Augustana College until 1950. From there she left for Fairview School of Nursing in Minneapolis, MN, where she completed her nurses training in Feb. of 1954.<br>
While attending Augustana College, Leila met her husband to be of more than 67 years, Richard Gilman. Richard and Leila were married on May 17, 1953, and from this union came four children. It was soon after their marriage that they left the states for foreign mission work in Cameroon, W. Africa. Their first-born, Susan, was the youngest passenger aboard the Queen Mary as they made their way overseas. Mari and Tom were born during their time in Cameroon, and Dan was born upon their return to the states. What adventures Leila had to tell about their work in Africa! Many of those stories are recorded for posterity in letters and journals kept in family libraries.<br>
Her gift for and love of writing served her well as she had a great interest in family history, poetry, and journaling. To quote from her writing, "The Value of Heritage", "There are many reasons to be assured that family is very important. Even more important is the realization that God knew us before we were born, that He designed every detail about each of us, that He planned our lives even before He created the earth (Eph.1:4), and He chose the family into which each of us would be born. Isn't that awesome?!" Among her other "favorite things" were, foremost, spending any time she could with family. Board games and word games, especially Scrabble, were a regular occurrence whenever family was together. When time came to return home from these gatherings, it was Leila who would frequently be heard speaking with her husband about staying a little while longer, "just to hear the banter of the family interacting". She will always be remembered for her "barely controlled" laughter when unexpected (and sometimes deviously planned) surprises would elicit a jump or scream from an unsuspecting family member. A favorite trick was to hide one of her many very-real looking spiders just where she knew it was sure to be spotted as one was getting into bed.<br>
Leila was also a gifted Counselor and a student of the Bible, attaining her Doctoral Degree in Christian Counseling at the age of 72. She worked for a number of years, both independently and with New Haven Ministries in Sioux Falls, helping others in their struggles. She loved people; she loved her family, and she loved her Lord. This was evident in every aspect of her life. It was said of her not long ago, "For learning by example what it means to live by unconditional love, to show encouragement, to extend grace, to love the Lord and follow Him, to exhibit class in every situation and season of life...there isn't another woman on earth who could have done a better job!"<br>
Leila's departure seemed too soon, though she is now free of every ailment that 90 years brings upon the flesh. For that, there is rejoicing. She will be long remembered and dearly missed by all who knew her.<br>
Preceeding Leila in death were her parents, Elmer and Ethel Soderstrom, brother, Elmer (Jr.) Soderstrom, husband, Richard Gilman and daughter, Susan Norton.<br>
Remaining and grateful for sharing her life are daughter, Mari Schwarting; sons, Tom (Patty) Gilman and Dan (Sheila) Gilman; grandchildren, Olivia, Angelyn, Jacob, Benjamin, Sara, Matthew, Laura, Austin, Braelyn, Zachary and Jackson; eight great-grandchildren; brother, Rodney (Dorothy) Soderstrom; and numerous nieces and nephews and other relatives.<br>
