Willis Franklin OSBORN
<p>
<a name ="I090111"><b>[I090111]</b></a><br />
Willis Franklin Osborn, 89, died on December 1, 2010, in Springville, California. He was born on December 9, 1920, to the late William Roe Osborn and the late Christina Hallie Osborn. He was their only child. <br>
Willis was a native of Springville and lived many years of his life in the Springville-Porterville area. His journey of life took him to other places in California, but the Springville-Porterville area was his earthly home. He was a faithful member of the church of Christ all of his life and attended the Springville church of Christ prior to his death. During his life, he was employed in several different vocations from clothing retail to maintenance services. Before retirement at age 62, he worked for Alpha Beta Markets as a maintenance engineer. <br>
Willis will be remembered for his skill as a carpenter and builder. He was able to design and construct most anything. He was a loving and gentle man who would share his talent with anyone who would ask. He was a man of integrity, honesty, hard work, and straightforwardness. He loved God, Jesus, and the church with all of his heart and taught the gospel to many people during his lifetime. Wherever he lived, he was an active member of the local church of Christ and served as a deacon in several congregations. <br>
His family will remember him as a humble, but strong father, grandfather, and great-grandfather. He led in his own quiet but sometimes humorous way. Members of the family will always reflect upon the many projects that he built for them and upon the entertainment he provided by the playing of his harmonica.<br>
Willis was preceded in death by his wife of 62 years, Jane Burts Osborn. Surviving are his 2 sons Larry F. Osborn and wife Joy, and Gene M. Osborn and wife Carol; his 3 grandchildren, Cyndi Osborn, Stacey Martinez and husband Ubaldo, and Scott Osborn; his 3 great-grandchildren, Sirena, Emilia, and Natalia Martinez; and two cousins, Clinton Osborn and Leland Osborn.<br>
A memorial service will be held on Saturday, December 18, 2010, at 2 P.M. at the church building of the Springville church of Christ at the corner of Tennis and Talley Streets, Springville, California.

Adils OTTARSSON
<p>
<a name ="I008125"><b>[I008125]</b></a><br />
Eadgils was a 6th century king of Sweden who appears in the Old English epic Beowulf.<br>
<br>
In the Norse sagas and Gesta Danorum appears a Swedish 6th century king having a closely similar name Adils, or Athisl. This king was also the son of a king named Ohthere and just like in Beowulf, Adils killed a king named Onela (Ali) with foreign assistance.<br>
<br>
In the Hrólf Kraki tradition, Adils (Eadgils) captured and married Yrsa (Yrs), the mother of Hrólf Kraki (Hrothulf). Not long after Hrólf became king, Eadgils requested his assistance against his uncle Áli (Onela). Hrólf sent his twelve companions, led by Bödvar Bjarki (who it is often remarked has similarities with Beowulf), Áli was defeated in the Battle on the Ice and Adils gained the kingdom. But when Adils refused to pay Hrólf's men the expected tributes for their help, Hrólf Kraki set off to Gamla Uppsala. As Adils was away, gathering reinforcements, Hrólf's mother and sister Yrsa then gave him a horn filled with gold and jewels and a famous ring called Sviagris 'Pig of the Swedes'. With the treasure given them by Yrsa, Hrólf and his men try to escape over the Fyrisvellir (Fyris Wolds). When Adils and his men pursued them, Hrólf desperately spilled out the gold to occupy the pursuers with treasure collecting instead. Adils, however, overtook Hrólf who desperately threw away Sviagris. When Adils stooped to pick it up with his spear Hrólf ungloriously cut him in the back screaming that he had bent the back of the most powerful man in Sweden, stole the ring once again and fled.<br>
<br>
Snorri Sturluson relates that Adils loved good horses and had the best horses in his days (interestingly, the contempary Gothic scholar Jordanes noted that the Swedes were famed for their good horses). One horse was named Slöngve and another one Raven, which he had taken from Áli. From this horse he had bred a horse also named Raven which he sent to king Godgest of Hålogaland, but Godgest could not manage it and fell from it and died, in Omd on the island of Andøya. Adils himself died in a similar way at the Disablót. Adils was riding around the Disa shrine when Raven stumbled and fell, and the king was thrown forward and hit his skull on a stone. He was buried at Uppsala, and was succeeded by Östen.<br>
    Witch-demons, I have heard men say,<br>
    Have taken Adils' life away.<br>
    The son of kings of Frey's great race,<br>
    First in the fray, the fight, the chase,<br>
    Fell from his steed -- his clotted brains<br>
    Lie mixed with mire on Upsal's plains.<br>
    Such death (grim Fate has willed it so)<br>
    Has struck down Ole's [Onela's] deadly foe. (Laing's translation [1])<br>
