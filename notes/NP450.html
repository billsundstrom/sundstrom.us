Gruffudd ap RHYS
<p>
<a name ="I009982"><b>[I009982]</b></a><br />
From Wikipedia, 12 June 2006:<br>
<br>
Gruffydd ap Rhys II (died 25 July 1201) was a prince of Deheubarth in south-west Wales. He was the son of Rhys ap Gruffydd (The Lord Rhys) and grandson of Gruffydd ap Rhys.<br>
<br>
Gruffydd was the eldest son of Rhys ap Gruffydd by his wife Gwenllian, daughter of Madog ap Maredudd prince of Powys. Rhys intended Gruffydd to be his main heir, and in 1189 he was married to Matilda, daughter of William de Braose, by whom he had two sons, Rhys and Owain. In Rhys' last years a feud developed between Gruffydd and his brother Maelgwn ap Rhys, both supported by some of their other brothers. In 1189 Rhys was persuaded to imprison Maelgwn, and he was given into Gruffydd's keeping at Dinefwr. Gruffydd handed him over to his father in law, William de Braose. In 1192 Rhys secured Maelgwn's release, but by now he and Gruffydd were bitter enemies. In 1194 Maelgwn and another brother Hywel defeated their father and imprisoned him, though he was later released by Hywel.<br>
<br>
Rhys ap Gruffydd died in 1197. Gruffydd was recognised as his successor after an interview with Archbishop Hubert the justiciar, but Maelgwn used troops supplied by Gwenwynwyn ab Owain of Powys to attack Aberystwyth. He captured the town and the castle, and took Gruffydd himself prisoner, later handing him over to Gwenwynwyn who in turn transferred him to the English who imprisoned him in Corfe Castle. In 1198 Gwenwynwyn threatened the English holdings at Painscastle and Elfael, and Gruffydd was released from captivity to try to mediate in the dispute. His efforts failed, and in the ensuing battle Gwenwynwyn was defeated. Gruffydd retained his liberty and by the end of the year had captured all of Ceredigion from Maelgwn except for the castles of Cardigan and Ystrad Meurig. In 1199 he took Cilgerran Castle. Maelgwn made an agreement with King John of England, selling Cardigan castle to him in exchange for the possession of the remainder of Ceredigion.<br>
<br>
In July 1201 another brother, Maredudd ap Rhys, was killed, and Gruffydd took over his lands. However on 25 July Gruffydd himself died of an illness and was buried in Strata Florida Abbey.<br>

Nest Verch RHYS
<p>
<a name ="I006730"><b>[I006730]</b></a><br />
Known as the most beautiful woman in Wales. She had many lovers. In Christmas 1108 Owain ap Cadwgan of Cardigan came to visit Gerald and Nesta. He so lusted after her that he, that night, attacked the castle and carried her off and had his way with her. This upset Henry I [King of England] so much that the incident started a war.<br>
Source:www.dcs.hull.ac.ukShe was stunningly beautiful, called the Helen of Wales. She was thedaughter of the last king of indenpendent Deheubarth, she was themistress of Henry I, king of England,and had a son by him Robert DeCarn, Earl of Dorchester and Gloucester. Henry I took the throne awayfrom his brother in 1100. She was the wife of Gerald de Windsor,Constable of Pembroke, she was romantically abducted by Owain apCadwgan,son of the Prince of Powys, and is generally supposed to have had anynumber of other romantic liaisons. She was the founder of moredynastiesthan is polite to mention. Thousands of Welsh children today arestill<br>
refered to as Nest in her honour.<br>
<br>
From Wikipedia<br>
<br>
Nest verch Rhys (died after 1136) was a princess of Deheubarth who was renowned for her beauty. She was the daughter of Prince Rhys ap Tewdwr by his wife, Gwladys verch Rhiwallon.<br>
<br>
After her father died in 1093, Deheubarth was conquerored by the Normans and King Henry I of England appointed himself her protector. Nest bore him a son, Henry FitzRoy. In 1100 King Henry decided to marry her to one of his knights, Gerald of Windsor, whom he appointed castellan of Pembroke. Nest and Gerald had four children:<br>
   1. William FitzGerald (died 1173)<br>
   2. Maurice FitzGerald, Lord of Lanstephen (died September 1, 1177)<br>
   3. David FitzGerald, Archdeacon of Cardigan and Bishop of St. David's<br>
   4. Angharad de Windsor<br>
<br>
During Christmas 1109, Nest and her husband were visited by her cousin, Owain ap Cadwgan. Owain was so taken with Nest's beauty that he and fifteen companions attacked Cenarth Bychan, seized Nest, and carried her off. This abduction earned her the nickname "Helen of Wales" because it led to civil war on a small scale. Nest bore to Owain two sons, Llywelyn and Einion, before finally being returned to her husband. After Gerald's death, Nest became the lover of Stephen, constable of Cardigan, by whom she had another son, Robert FitzStephen.<br>
<br>
Nest's daughter, Angharad, was the mother of historian Gerald of Wales. Her sons Maurice and Robert campaigned in Ireland with Strongbow; Robert died there in 1182.<br>

<a name ="I088740"><b>[I088740]</b></a><br />
On March 19, 1995, Frederick Ribotto, who was recovering from a stroke, climbed out of the window of his fourth-floor room on the hospital's medical-surgical unit and fell or jumped to his death. Plaintiff claims that her husband's death could have been avoided if, when the hospital built a new psychiatric unit in the early 1990s, It had also built a seclusion room for disturbed medical patients on the medical-surgical unit. Plaintiff alleges that Davis, the vice president of behavioral medicine and rehabilitation medicine at the time that the hospital's psychiatric unit was being built, had a duty to ensure that the hospital complied with state guidelines and regulations which require such a seclusion room.<br>

William Laurence RICCI
<p>
<a name ="I033641"><b>[I033641]</b></a><br />
The Man, the Myth, the Legend, William (Bill L. Ricci died in his home with his wife, Linda in Wednesday, March 9, 2005. He had lost his battle with cancer. Bill was born on October 26, 1940, in Upland, California and lived here his entire life other than the years he served in the United States Army. Bill enlisted in the Army in 1962 during the escalation of the war in Viet Nam. During his years in the Army he served his County with pride, honor and dignity. His accomplishments during his time in t he service are too many to list, however those that he was most proud of are: graduated from Officers Candidate School; served as an Airborne Ranger, the 82nd Airborne Division; Green Beret; 1st Battalion, 8th US Infantry Division where he received the Bronze Star. Bill received the Air Medal three different times for his heroism while participating in aerial flight, flying the Huey and Cobra helicopters in Viet Nam. For those of you that knew him and loved him you know he loved flying helecopters. He has many stories of his days at St. George's Catholic School which he attended through eighth grade. Bill was in the first graduating class from Upland High School in 1958. After his Honorable Discharge from the United States Army, Bill returned to Upland to complete his education at Cal Poly Pomona with a degree in Bachelor of Science in Business Adminstration in 1971. Bill began his business career with Security Pacific Bank in 1969. He completed their Management Training Program and advanced up the corpor ate ladder to Senior Vice President and Director of Human Resources for the over 500 banking offices. He was either admired or not for his frankness even though it was in their best interest. He always treated everyone fairly. During this time he received his MBA degree from Claremont Graduate School. In 1989, Bill joined Geneva Companies in Irvine, where he was the Senior Vice President and Director of Operations as well as Human Resources. Geneva provided him with a challenging environment which he love d mostly, and sometimes hated. He retired in 2002 to pursue his love of art which he continued to do until the day he died. As a matter of fact, he sold one of his paintings the week before he passed away. His paintings were in watercolor, acrylic and his least favorite, oil. He was fortunate to have the benefit of Robert E. Wood's mentoring as well as being a member of several art alliances, his most favorite though was the Art Box under Sylvia Megerdichian direction. He loved painting with the "ladies" from the Art Box every Monday. Bill has two wonderful sons, Gabriel and Matthew and was blessed to be the grandfather of Dylan, age two, Gabriel's son. His beautiful daughter-in-law, Elizabeth, joined our family by marrying Matthew in July of 2004. Bill married Linda on Christmas Eve, 1982, the time of the year they both loved and cherished. His loving mother, Georgia Ricci resides in Upland as well and too many other loving family members to mention. In our mind we know Bill is in a better place, in ou r hearts we wish he were here. Rosary will be held at 9:30 a.m. and Mass at 10 a.m. on Wednesday, March 16th all at St. Anthony Catholic Church in Upland. Burial at Bellevue Memorial Park, Ontario. In lieu of flowers Bill would appreciate donations made to the City of Hope or Vietnam Veterans Memorial or Ducks Unlimited. Stone Funeral Home in charge of arrangements.<br>
