Penny Lynn HALL
<p>
<a name ="I047520"><b>[I047520]</b></a><br />
Penny Lynn (Hall) Swanson , beloved mother, daughter, sister and friend, passed away peacefully November 19, 2002. Penny was born in Columbus, Ohio, on January 26, 1954. She is survived by her sons Walter Charles (Chas) Swanson III, Salt Lake City,<br>
and David Lee Swanson , Eden, Utah; mother, Ruth Crawford, London, Ohio; father, Milton Hall, Delaware, Ohio; sisters, Kathy (Gary) Young and children, Hilliard, Ohio; Marilyn Hall, London, Ohio; Barbara (Jeff) Tucker and children, Arvada, CO; brother, Lee Hall, Dublin, Ohio; her beloved partner, Dan Mellus, Sandy, Utah; and her faithful companion, Jilly's Prime Margaret (Maggie).<br>
Penny loved music and really enjoyed singing along. Her other passions were fashion and decorating. Penny had a great sense of humor and was always smiling; she had the natural ability of making people feel at ease and comfortable around her. She was sincerely kind, and had a deep concern for all living things. Her thoughtfulness was only exceeded by her compassion.<br>
Penny and her canine companion, Maggie, were pet partner volunteers the last year of her life. They were members of the Utah Animal Assisted Therapy Association. Their goal was to bring comfort, love and hope to those in need of the human-animal bond. Penny and Maggie brought all of those things and more to the residents at Alta Ridge Assisted Living, the Neighborhood House Adult Day Care, and Primary Children's Camp Hobie.<br>
Her family would like to express their heartfelt appreciation to all family and friends who gave their support and prayers in time of need. A special thank you goes out to Dr. Mark Ott, for his kindness and his unwavering hope and valiant efforts; and to the 6th floor staff of LDS Hospital in Salt Lake City for their professionalism, compassion and bedside manner.<br>
Funeral services will be held 10 am Friday November 22, 2002 at Larkin Sunset Gardens, 1950 E. 10600 S. Sandy, Utah where friends may call Thurs. Nov. 21 6-8 p.m. and Friday 9-9:45 am prior to services. Internment Larkin Sunset Garden. Directors Lindquist's Bountiful Mortuary.<br>
To my love: You gave your heart to all; we give your heart to God. Dan<br>

Wells Albert Hall was born in Bennington, Vermont in 1877. He attended Brockton High School in Massachusetts and was graduated from Brown University in 1904 where he was a lineman on the varsity football team. He later received a Masters Degree from Harvard University. He moved to Concord in 1906 to teach chemistry, coach football and to act as sub-master of Concord High School. In 1907, he was elected to the position of Superintendent of Schools and carried out those duties until shortly before his death in 1938<br>
During his lifetime, Mr. Hall gained nation-wide acclaim as a progressive, sound educator. He combined this lifelong interest in academics with the ability of a strong, capable business executive. Together, these qualities enabled him to build and maintain a first-rate educational system for the town of Concord<br>
Shortly after Mr. Hall's death, one of his fellow educators wrote: "He was one of the men engaged in the work of education who gave evidence in his daily life of the very highest ideas of public service. His devotion to the interests of the students was unfailing. He has left an impression, not only on the schools of Concord, but also on those of the State, that will be lasting."<br>
