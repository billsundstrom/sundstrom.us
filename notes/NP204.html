<br>
Dear Bill: <br>
I would like to make a correction to your family tree:  Wade C. GOHEEN is NOT<br>
the son of John Wilson GOHEEN.  John Wilson GOHEEN married Jennie Rankin <br>
GWINN (older sister of my Ggrandfather John Edgar GWINN)--see Park Hill Cemetery records at<br>
www.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~waclacem  which shows "Father" John Wilson GOHEEN next to "Mother" Jennie Rankin GOHEEN. <br>
Wade's father was Joseph M. GOHEEN (b. ~1856), son of Davis GOHEEN (1801 - 1877). <br>
The 1900 Census of Porter, Clarion Co, PA shows Davis' widow Sarah as HOH with son Joseph M. <br>
and grandchildren Wade and Florence.  John Wilson GOHEEN's father was James Miller GOHEEN, the brother of Davis.<br>

Elmer William GOMES
<p>
<a name ="I114853"><b>[I114853]</b></a><br />
On Wednesday, July 22, 2020, Elmer peacefully passed into the gates of his heavenly home. He was born on April 20, 1922, in Hollister, California. In 1949, Elmer met, fell in love with, and married Ruby M. Hillary.<br>
Elmer and Ruby had four children, Susan Turner (Ken), their children Eddie and Joe; Michael Gomes (Sue) and their three children Melissa, Mitch and Garrett; Patty Strohn (Pete) and their two children Kevin and Adam; Elizabeth Smith (Courtney) and their two children Kevin and Sean. Elmer also had sixteen great-grandchildren and several nieces and nephews. He was preceded in death by his wife Ruby; son-in-law, Pete Strohn; his father and mother; and eight brothers and sisters.<br>
Eighteen years ago, Elmer met and married Rena Darley. The companionship and camaraderie was a blessing to them both. Rena preceded Elmer in death on June 16, 2020.<br>
Because of his distinctive laugh, Elmerʼs nickname was "Rooster." Anyone who knew him recognized him by his signature laugh and we couldnʼt help but laugh along.<br>
Elmer grew up a farmer. During WWII, Elmerʼs older siblings served in the war. Being the youngest, Elmer was needed to stay home and help his father work the family farm. This bothered Elmer, knowing his brothers were serving our country and he wasnʼt. He finally realized that providing food for our soldiers was serving our country.<br>
Elmerʼs greatest dream was to be a cattle rancher. In 1968, he and Ruby bought a ranch in Roseburg, Oregon. For 12 years they traveled from the farm to the ranch before permanently settling in Oregon in 1980.<br>
Funeral services will be on Wednesday, July 29, 2020, at St. Josephʼs Catholic Church at 12:10 p.m. followed by a private burial.<br>

Frank D. GOOCH
<p>
<a name ="I018588"><b>[I018588]</b></a><br />
A Brutal Murder<br>
This community was shocked last Monday when the report was flashed around that Frank D. Gooch had been murdered, and on investigation, it was found that the report was true and that he had met death at the hands of Claude Coonse. It seems that Coonse was owing Gooch some money, and last Monday forenoon the latter went to the Turner Ranch, where Coonse was working, to collect the money due him and an argument arose and Coonse knocked Gooch over onto the teeth of a hay buck, face down, and then jumped on the prostrate man, catching him by the head or shoulders, and literally beat his face into a pulp, breaking the jaw bones and all the bones in the face, causing death in a few minutes. Acting on the advise of parties, Coonse came to town and gave himself up to Constable Boston and was later taken to jail at Alturas by Sheriff Sharp. The above are the facts as near as we can get them. There were no witnesses to the horrible tragedy except the little nine-year old son of Mr. Gooch, who had accompanied his father on the trip that ended in his death. An inquest was held by Deputy Coroner Pengelly, of Alturas and the verdict of the jury was that Frank D. Gooch came to his death from a fractured skull inflicted by Claude Coonse. The funeral was held Monday afternoon from the M. E. Church, the services being conducted by Re. Joseph Miller. The church was crowded with relatives and friends who came to pay their last tribute of respect to the murdered man, and the remains were followed to their last resting-place in the Cedarville Cemetery by the large number assembled. Frank Dwight Gooch was born at Reno, Nevada, December 24, 1876, and came with his parents to Surprise Valley two years later. He was married to Katie E. Davidson, January 26, 1907. To this union were born six children, Emma, Clyde, William, Frankie, Catherine, and Delbert, all of whom live to mourn his loss, as also does his father, O. S. Gooch, and two sister, Mrs. Gladys Wentzell and Mrs. Belva Sevier, and two brothers, Guy and Roy Gooch of this place. He united with the Methodist church in 1907 and of which he has been an active member ever since. He died June 16, 1923, at the age of 47 years, 5 months and 8 days. The act of savage brutality that ended the life of Frank Gooch has cast a mantle of gloom over the entire community and the heartfelt sympathy of all go out tot he sadly bereaved wife and little children, and to the sorrowing relatives. As this is a case to be determined by the courts the Record refrains from any comment at this time.<br>
