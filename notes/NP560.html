Pharilda Matilda VANWALLEGHAN
<p>
<a name ="I000332"><b>[I000332]</b></a><br />
Pharilda secondly married Garland A Treloar before 1947.<br>
</p>
Theresa Catherine VANWEES
<p>
<a name ="I026336"><b>[I026336]</b></a><br />
Theresa McKay passed away January 20, 2018. She lived a vigorous 92 years. Her book of life began in Heerlen, Limburg, the Netherlands in 1925. She and her mother came to the States in the late 1940's to see the family's first grandchild. That closed the first chapter and the second one opened.<br>
She met her husband in Dayton through some mutual friends and stayed in the USA. The rest of her family also came to the USA. Her younger brother became involved in the trucking industry and her younger sister became a CPA in Chicago.<br>
Early in her marriage she and her husband liked to travel the eastern states and visit the area he grew up in; southern Ohio. She worked for Rike's in downtown Dayton until the first of three sons came on the scene. Then raising three boys, taking care of the household and volunteering at St Luke's became a full time job.<br>
In 1978 that chapter closed and then the next one started when her husband of 29 years, died of cancer.<br>
She decided to find a job doing what she liked and had 20 years of experience doing. She became a nanny for a family in the local area. But her story was not over yet. The family moved to Austin Texas and invited her to come along. There she learned the flavor of Austin and met up with her younger sister after many years apart. The family moved to Atlanta and she went with them as well.<br>
It was in Atlanta that she kept the most busy, the Georgia Walkers when the weather was good and ushering at the Fox theatre to keep the juices flowing with various events.<br>
The next chapter started when Theresa retired and came back to the Beavercreek area, returning to the home where she raised her family. Not to leave dust on her feet, she joined the Senior club, took trips with the St Luke's travel group. In the nicer weather she loved her walks on the local bike path meeting new friends that though were much faster than her; would slow down to see how she was doing. If the weather was bad, she would walk on the treadmill. Walking took her back to her days in the Netherlands; where her family would walk after church every Sunday. To keep in touch with the little ones, she started babysitting at St Luke's and at League of Women's voters meetings.<br>
She is survived by a sister-in-law, her own three sons, their wives and three grand children. There are six nieces and nephews and their families. She was preceded in death by her parents, two sisters , two brothers, her husband and many special friends.<br>
The memorial will take place May 5, 2018. Friends and relatives can gather starting at 9am at St Lukeʼs Catholic Church in Beavercreek Ohio. The memorial mass will be at 10:30am. A light lunch will follow the mass. Burial will be after the lunch at the Beaver cemetery on Dayton-Xenia Rd where concluding ceremony will take place.<br>

Abraham Pieter van Zelm<br>
After bravely fighting cancer for almost two years, it is with great sadness that we announce the passing of Abraham Pieter Van Zelm on October 18th at his home in San Marcos, California. While the warmth of his smile and twinkle of his eye will be sorely missed, we are comforted by the fact that he left this earth peacefully, with his beloved wife, Joan, by his side. In his last days, he was also surrounded by the comfort of both of his loving daughters.<br>
Born in Delft, Holland in 1924, Abraham (known as both "Abe" and "Bram" by his friends) was distinguished by his bravery during World War II in helping his parents, three sisters and others survive during the occupation. On several occasions he was nearly captured by the Nazis, but was hidden by his courageous friends.<br>
He was also a gifted student, attending the Technological Institute of Delft, Holland, studying advanced mathematics and mechanical engineering. He immigrated to the United States in 1950 and became a citizen in 1956. Shortly thereafter, he settled in Southern California, where he held senior management positions in the insurance and mortgage banking fields. <br>
In 1977, he married his beloved Joan Fagering, and together they found great joy by spending time at the beach, sailing and traveling in Europe. He was loved and respected by all his friends, and known as a very gentle man who showed kindness to everyone he met. <br>
He is survived by his wife, Joan Van Zelm; two daughters, Judy Bruner and Connie Olsen; three grandsons, Christopher, Eric, and Neil Bruner; his sister, Wilhelmina Segervall, and many nieces and nephews. A celebration of his great spirit and life will be held in the San Francisco Bay Area in November.<br>
