Capt. Evans Dies; Well Known Here<br>
On Friday evening of last week, Captain Manville Evans died at the Gretchwick hospital, in Buffalo, following an illness that began in February last. He was 58 years old, and had been intimately connected with steamship traffic on the St. Lawrence River for over forty years.<br>
Captain Evans was well known in Cape Vincent, he having married Miss Emma Roseboom, of this village. She died about twenty years ago.<br>
An Alexandria Bay correspondent writes as follows concerning Captain Evans:<br>
"Captain Evans was born in the Goose Bay section of the town of Alexandria in 1875, a son of Jason and Anna McLean Evans.<br>
"After completing school he started his career on the steamboat Massena under Captain Frank Dana.<br>
"Captain Dana took a liking for the young man and by the time he was 21 years old he was qualified for the papers of a full-fledged captain and became the youngest captain on the St. Lawrence river.<br>
"Since the beginning of his captaincy he had been in charge of the St. Lawrence, the Empire State and the Island Belle.<br>
"For 15 years he was captain of the Vesta, one of the best vessels on the St. Lawrence. He had also been captain of the Ruma, a steam yacht belonging to H. W. Smith, of Syracuse, and for the last five years he was master of the steamboat Roosevelt, one of several ferry boats belonging to the Hudson Ferry line plying between this village and Lockport, Ont.<br>
"Because of ill health he retired, however, in February of this year.<br>
"He was first married to Miss Emma Roseboom. Shortly after the death of his first wife he was married to Miss Agnes Cornwall.<br>
"His only survivors are his wife, Mrs. Agnes Cornwall Evans, and a first cousin, Mrs. Wellington Willix, both of Alexandria Bay.<br>
"The body of Captain Evans was brought to Alexandria Bay for interment."<br>

William B. 'Bill' Everson , Birmingham: Theater lover was 'a rock' of local guild<br>
By many accounts, Bill Everson was the backbone of St. Dunstan's Theatre Guild of Cranbrook.<br>
In his five decades with the group, he performed in numerous productions, directed several, once served as guildpresident, and often worked behind the scenes to head tasks from lighting to set design. He also invigorated cast mates during the Bloomfield Hills guild's pre-play recitation rituals and helped write scripts as well as coordinate original revues.<br>
The work made him "a rock," said longtime friend Sally Garrison, a fellow guild member. "He was always doing what was needed."<br>
Mr. Everson died Saturday, May 12, 2007, at Beaumont Hospital in Royal Oak. He was 81.<br>
Born May 26, 1925, in Stoughton, Wis., he attended the University of Notre Dame before serving in the U.S. Navy. He later earned a business administration degree from the University of Michigan. After a stint working in advertising for the Hudson's department store in Detroit, he became a writer at the MacManus, John & Adams advertising agency. He retired as senior vice president in 1989.<br>
Much of Mr. Everson's free time was devoted to St. Dunstan's, on whose stage he transformed into various characters. In "The Odd Couple," he played Felix, a pedant forced to room with a slob. And in one of his last performances, the 2001 rendition of the Pulitzer Prize-winning play "Harvey," he fleshed out Dr. Chumley, who attempted to locate a man befriending an imaginary rabbit.<br>
"He just liked playing a character," said his wife, Betty. "He enjoyed the whole thing."<br>
A longtime member of the Bloomfield Open Hunt club, Mr. Everson served with the Cultural Council of Birmingham/Bloomfield as well as the Ad Craft Club. He also participated in the Cranbrook Writers' Guild Conference.<br>
For years, He and his wife belonged to the Nomads traveling group, trekking to spots such as England, Norway and Mexico.<br>
An avid gardener, Mr. Everson tended a spot brimming with lilies, one of his favorite flowers.<br>
Besides his wife, other survivors include two sons, Eric and Christopher; a daughter, Margaret Thele; two grandchildren; and a sister-in-law, Geri Paton.<br>
Services have been held.<br>
Memorials may be made to St. Dunstan's Theatre Guild of Cranbrook, P.O. Box 59, Birmingham, MI 48012; or Easter Seals-Adult Mental Health Services, 22170 W. Nine 9 Mile Rd., Southfield, MI 48033.<br>
