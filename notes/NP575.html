<p>
<a name ="I074548"><b>[I074548]</b></a><br />
Vincent William Weidner of Mount Prospect The funeral service for Vincent William Weidner will be held at 11 a.m. Wednesday, July 1, at Grace Lutheran Church, Wolf Road and Euclid Ave., Mount Prospect. Interment will be private in Memory Gardens Cemetery. Visitation will be from 4 to 9 p.m. Tuesday, June 30, at Friedrichs Funeral Home, 320 W. Central Road (at Northwest Highway), Mount Prospect, and from 10 a.m. until the time of the service Wednesday, at the church. Born Aug. 26, 1952, in Elgin, to Elsie (nee Klages) and Vincent Clarence Weidner, he passed away suddenly Friday, June 26, 2009, at Northwest Community Hospital in Arlington Heights, after collapsing while umpiring a youth softball game. Vince graduated from the University of Wisconsin - Whitewater with a bachelor's degree in business administration. He furthered his education by receiving his master's degree from DePaul University. He was first employed at the Mount Prospect State Bank, where he met his wife, Jeanne M. Brandeau. Upon graduation from college, he worked at a Chicago utility company, where he was in human resources for 30 years. For the last several years, Vince expanded his professional horizons. Vince was an instructor at the Northwest Suburban Driving School, but found pure enjoyment when he became a school bus driver for School District 57. Vince was also a coach, umpire and referee for many local area youth sports organizations. He excelled in everything he pursued. He was "able to move mountains" with his perseverance, determination and dedication to the task at hand. Vince was a devoted and much loved husband for 35 years to Jeanne; loving father of Timothy (Janae) of Yorkville and Sheri of Mount Prospect; loving and doting grandfather of Lilah; and "big brother" to Victoria Hodor-Freeman, Valerie (Mark) Gaylord and Vivian (Tony) Wozniak. He is also survived by his mother, Elsie; and was a loving uncle of many nieces and nephews. Vince was preceded in death by his father, Vincent; his brother, Vance Robert; and his father-in-law, Charles Brandeau. He was a true friend and a wonderful man who lived every moment and touched so many that can't be named. Vince will be remembered as an avid "Sox" fan, the grill master, a detailed planner, an enthusiastic golfer and a true sportsman. All of his spare time was devoted to his family, as he never missed any athletic events and was his children's #1 fan. "He leaves us with fond memories and heavy hearts as he enters into his eternal life." He will surely be missed, but his organs and tissues will continue to help others. In lieu of flowers, contributions can be made to the Weidner family for a memorial fund to be established at a later date.<br>
