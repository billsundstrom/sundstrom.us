Holbrook Lynedon HORTON
<p>
<a name ="I020543"><b>[I020543]</b></a><br />
Holbrook Lynedon Horton, 93, of Farmington, died Saturday, (March 17, 2001), after a long and giving life. Born in Portland, ME, and raised in Concord, NH, most of his years were spent in Saddle River, NJ, where he was active on the Board of Education, Board of Health and in The Valley Club and the Zion Lutheran Church. His devoted wife, Julia (Witherell) Horton, predeceased him in 1992, after 57 years of marriage. In 1994, he moved from Saddle River to The Gables, Farmington, where he had a happy and supportive home. His care for the past two years has been lovingly and professionally given by the Avon Health Center, Avon. He leaves his two sons and daughters-in-law, Christopher and Sherryl of Unionville, and Timothy and Margaret of Martinsville, NJ; and four grandchildren, Brendan and his wife, Ann; Elizabeth, Joshua and Tobiah. He was longtime editor and vice president of The Industrial Press, New York City, and for many years the chief editor of "Machinery's Handbook,'' considered "the bible'' of the tool and die and mechanical engineering professions. One of several books he authored,  "Mathematics At Work,'' now in its fourth printing, was awarded a top 100 ranking for technical books in the year it was published. A graduate of Worcester Polytechnic Institute in 1929, where he belonged to Theta Chi, edited several college publications, sang in the chorus and played in the mandolin band, he worked for the PWA during the depression, and as an industry advisor to tool and die manufacturers during World War II. An avid reader, gardener and bridge player, he was a loving husband, father, grandfather and caring friend. Many turned to Holbrook in times of need and in times of joy for his encouragement, wisdom and appreciation. He spent every summer for over 40 years at Flood's Cove, Friendship, ME, with his wife, Julia; and various members of his direct and extended family. His spirit inhabits that place and resides in us all. A private interment ceremony will be held in Concord, NH. Memorial donations may be made to Worcester Polytechnic Institute, 100 Institute Rd., Worcester, MA 01609. Arrangements are being handled by The Ahern Funeral Home, Inc.<br>

Charles HOSKING
<p>
<a name ="I039144"><b>[I039144]</b></a><br />
ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. - Every Friday afternoon Chuck Hosking chugs up the hill toward Sandia National Laboratories on his coaster bike with an 8-foot-tall banner strapped to his seat and handlebars. He sets up at one of the gates where employees leave Kirtland Air Force Base and unfurls a sign.<br>
On this blustery afternoon it says, "Jesus said love your enemies - do we?"<br>
Hosking is a trim 64 thanks to the bicycle being his only mode of transportation and his diet consisting only of food he finds in commercial garbage bins. He stands quietly and holds the sign for about an hour and a half while the employees leave the base and drive home from work.<br>
He usually gets a honk here and there, sometimes accompanied by a smile and a wave and sometimes by a middle finger.<br>
"Most days are very boring," he says. "Thereʼs a complete lack of interest."<br>
Hosking holds his vigil to protest the labsʼ nuclear weapons work, hoping the brilliant scientific minds employed inside the gates might consider a different line of work or, better yet in Hoskingʼs view, that the contractor that runs the labs will decide to switch all that brain power over to solving the problems of global warming.<br>
So it has gone for 30 years.<br>
Has anything changed in all those decades?<br>
"No," Hosking cheerfully told me. "I realize itʼs not having any significant results."<br>
Itʼs hard to imagine spending decades trying to accomplish something and not making a dent. I told Hosking he reminded me of a Greek fellow named Sisyphus who futilely pushed the rock up the hill day after day after day.<br>
He laughed and reminded me that doing the same thing again and again and expecting a different result is also one of the definitions of insanity.<br>
Hosking moved to Albuquerque in 1983 with his wife, Mary Ann Fiske, who worked full time for peace and justice issues until she died five years ago. Aware of the national labsʼ presence near their new home, Hosking thought it was his moral duty to wage a protest. He spent several weeks counting cars going in and out of the base gates in the mornings and afternoons to pick the best time to protest and measured speed limit signs to determine how big the letters should be on his signs.<br>
He settled on afternoons from 3:30 to 5 and very big signs. He also decided that instead of preaching with statements, his signs should provoke thought with questions. Example: "Are you sure weapons of mass destruction build peace?"<br>
Hosking kicked off his vigil on Ash Wednesday 1983 and vowed to go to the base every day for the 40 days of Lent. At the end of 40 days he kept going. For months. Then he started adding a morning shift as well and kept that up for nine months.<br>
The vigil stopped for a few years when Hosking and Fiske moved to Africa but since 1994, Hosking has faithfully kept it up every Friday afternoon.<br>
Early on, in 1985, a research physicist at the labs who had been grappling with what he viewed as the moral contradictions of his work for years approached Hosking and told him he was resigning. But Hosking told me that since that event he has sensed a waning interest in his Friday vigil.<br>
"I donʼt think I have much more chance of changing their minds than they have of changing mine." he said.<br>
What drew me to Hosking was not so much his cause but his indefatigable determination in the face of what appears to be futility.<br>
To help me understand him better, Hosking told me about a formative time in his life.<br>
At 14, he attended his first protest march, a fair housing protest in Chicagoʼs northern suburbs, and decided then and there that he needed to examine his lifeʼs purpose. Hosking spent the next six years reading, thinking and praying (he had plans to become an Episcopal priest) and came to the conclusion he would live simply and work to advance peace and justice and to end global inequity.<br>
He chose teaching as his career and decided early on to live on little and give away most of his income. These days, Hosking works as a note taker for disabled students at Central New Mexico Community College. He keeps track of what he spends and last year his total was $1,755 and most of that went toward utilities and property taxes on the house he owns in a downtown neighborhood.<br>
The Friday vigil by now is as ingrained in his being as frugality and charity, so questions about whether he is having any effect seem beside the point.<br>
"Iʼm just one of the workers out there in the trenches, you know, just holding a sign and making a statement in hopes that you scatter some seeds and some of them come to fruition," he told me on the 30th anniversary of his vigil. "My feeling is as long as we can still think seriously about issues, thereʼs hope."<br>
