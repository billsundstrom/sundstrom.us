Ashland Daily Tidings, 23 December 2004<br>
By Vickie Aldous<br>
Astronauts first walked on the moon just six years before Don Laws was elected to the Ashland City Council.<br>
Laws gives way to new order:<br>
Southern Oregon University students who have already graduated and settled into their careers hadn't even been born, and Ashland was still navigating the change from mill town to tourist Mecca.<br>
Laws took office in 1975 and served almost continuously until his last council meeting on Tuesday. He had a short break after losing a a bid for mayor against Cathy Shaw in 1988, but was back on the council in 1990.<br>
Jack Hardesty defeated Laws in the November election and will take office in January.<br>
Throughout his time on the council, Laws listened to community members and sought solutions to Ashland's problems, according to former Councilor Susan Reid, who was elected in 1982 and worked beside Laws through 2002.<br>
"He took his role of listening to the community very seriously," Reid said. "He has always worked to try and fix a need in the community. He didn't come with an agenda as far as I could tell. He came with the attitude of, 'How can I help facilitate your ideas?'"<br>
Leaving a legacy:<br>
Many of Laws' achievements benefited the elders and youths of the community.<br>
"Don has always worked very hard on senior issues and to maintain the ability of seniors and people on fixed incomes to continue living here," Reid said.<br>
He was one of the key founders of the senior center on Homes Avenue.<br>
As a political science professor at SOU, Laws provided a direct link between the city government and the university, and stayed attuned to the needs of students.<br>
He worked to cut bus fares to a quarter in a move that benefited students while reducing traffic and air pollution. The council later agreed to increase its subsidies for bus transportation so that all trips inside Ashland are free - resulting in a doubling of ridership.<br>
With Reid, Laws advocated abandoning a sewage treatment plan that would have led to treated wastewater being sprayed on a hillside north of Ashland. After fierce debates, a slim council majority voted to treat the wastewater to higher standards and continue emptying it into Bear Creek for the benefit of fish.<br>
"The effluent made up at times one-third to one-half of the water in Bear Creek," Laws said. "I thought that was pretty important."<br>
A changing city:<br>
Laws also worked on the Comprehensive Plan, a behind-the-scenes, laborious task that yielded a blueprint to guide Ashland's growth and development.<br>
Looking back, Laws said the plan has helped make Ashland the beautiful town that it is today - creating a new set of problems.<br>
"The improvements have made the city so attractive it's changing the nature of the city," he said, pointing to continuing pressure for growth as well as the lack of affordable housing.<br>
Because of the millions of dollars it would cost to provide adequate affordable housing, residents may have to accept the fact that Ashland is changing and will not be able to attract many low and moderate-income families, he said.<br>
Meanwhile, growth is continuing at a pace that has some fearing Ashland will lose its small town character.<br>
"We'll have to work to make Ashland the best small city we can instead of the best small town," Laws said. "If we can't keep it a small town, let's make it the best small city in the world."<br>
A changing council:<br>
Laws impatience with the slow pace of the council has shown through in recent years.<br>
According to Oregon Shakespeare Festival Executive Director Paul Nicholson, Laws has exhibited integrity, a sense of humor, thoughtfulness and prudence. He respects process, but also knows that action moves the city forward.<br>
"Don, ultimately, is a man focused on results," Nicholson said.<br>
Laws acknowledged his occasional frustration with long council discussions.<br>
"The present council has been the most difficult for me to work with in terms of trying to get things done," he said. "But it's not because we have poor councilors. It's the opposite. We have councilors who are concerned about everything. Because we go into such detail, it drives other things out and puts a difficult burden on staff. It's been a hard time almost because the councilors are too good."<br>
Although he doesn't plan to run for elected office again, Laws said he hopes to stay involved by serving on city committees and commissions.<br>
"Believe it or not, I enjoy it," he said. "I'd hate to be in any community that does things where I don't have a say about it. I've had the ability to make those decisions. I hope they were good and intelligent decisions. I hope the city is at least 1 percent better because I was on the council."<br>
