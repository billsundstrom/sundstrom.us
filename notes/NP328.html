Lipsett, pioneer resident and business man of this city. Mr. Lipsett was 84 years of age. Death came to him at the Lipsett residence, 315 East Spruce street. <br>
James L. Lipsett, son of Francis and Sarah Lipsett, was born August 25, 1854, in Gray county Ontario. He lived on the homestead farm of his parents until he was 18 years of age when he moved to Annon, Ontario, where he served three years apprenticeship to become a blacksmith. He came to Sault Ste. Marie in September, 1875, and started a smithy; a trade which he followed for ten years. His business expanded with the town and from 1880 until 1887, Mr. Lipsett operated a livery and stage business. For two years his stage carried the mail from St. Ignace to the Sault. During this time he held a contract to fill the grade of twelve miles of the Duluth/South Shore and Atlantic railway. <br>
Mr. Lipsett stared one of the first farm machinery and implement businesses in the Sault which was the start of the present Lipsett companies in Chippewa county. For a time he was in the construction business as a member of the firm of Lipsett and Gregg, and at that time (the late 1880's) built the Ferguson block and five brick buildings at Fort Brady. <br>
Mr. Lipsett, former mayor of Sault Ste. Marie and thirty-three years president of the Central Savings Bank, had been confined to his bed since May 25. His illness had been years long, however, following a paralytic stroke some eight years ago. <br>
He married twice and is survived by his wife, Mrs. Minnie Lipsett to whom he had been married almost 55 years. Funeral arrangments this afternoon still were indefinite, but the funeral will be held at the home at 315 E. Spruce Street, probably Thursday afternoon. <br>
He is survived by: His wife, Mrs. J.L. Lipsett. Four children, Verne Lipsett; Mrs. Clarence Alphord of Flint; Mrs. Miriam L. Irvin of the Sault; and James L. Lipsett, Jr. of the Sault. Three sisters--Mrs. Rebecca Watson, Portland, Oregon; Mrs. J.A. Douglas, Miami, and Mrs. Sara Agnew, Detroit. Eleven grandchildren, and six great-grandchildren.
