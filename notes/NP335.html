Robert Henry LUNDBERG
<p>
<a name ="I054365"><b>[I054365]</b></a><br />
Robert H. ""Bud'' Lundberg , 77, died March 5, 1997, in a Bismarck hospital, where he had been a board member for more than 30 years. A memorial service will be at 2 p.m. Saturday at Trinity Lutheran Church, Bismarck, with the Revs. Steve Sathre and Dick Owens officiating.<br>
After cremation, a private spring burial will be held at Sunne Lutheran Church, Wilton.<br>
He was the only child of Axel and Myrtle (Schilling) Lundberg , born Feb. 4, 1920, in Bismarck. He graduated from high school at Regan High School in 1938, and from University of North Dakota in 1942, with majors in history and social sciences. In 1942, he volunteered with the U.S. Navy Air Corp, trained in Corpus Christi, Texas, and graduated as a dive bomber. He married Evelyn Olson, who grew up in Chicago, in Oklahoma City on Jan. 13, 1944.<br>
Bud was one of the first people to become involved in the initial stages of a guided missile program (controlling pilotless planes by electronic means) and to become an instructor in the program. Eventually, the needed technology was not yet well advanced to continue the program.<br>
He became the first pilot of Bombing Squadron 152, stationed out of Midway Island and Pelileu Island. He accumulated more than 1,500 hours of flying time. Of special interest is the fact that his plane was the first to find debris of the remains of the torpedoed Indianapolis, which had delivered the bomb to Guam. Only 200 out of 2,000 men survived. He was discharged as a 1st Lieutenant from the Navy Air Corp in Chicago after the war.<br>
He and Evelyn moved to Wilton, where he taught American history, social science and biology. He also coached the basketball team and was principal of the high school. They subsequently began farming near Regan and started raising cattle. They built a farming operation of considerable size over the course of six years. He followed the continued operation of this all his life.<br>
He entered UND law school in 1951, graduating third in his class with Order of the Coif in 1954. He joined Harold Anderson as the Assistant Burleigh County State's Attorney until 1960. He then joined Alfred Thompson. He practiced through the years with excellent attorneys: Max Rosenberg, Irv Nodland, Norlyn Schulty, Pat Conmy, Bill Lucus, Tim Lervic and Tom Dixon. He remained ""of counsel'' after retirement.<br>
In 1981, he had his first heart attack and bypass surgery and as a result, in 1983, went on a part-time basis with the Lundberg , Nodland, Schultz Law Firm.<br>
That same year Prairie Public Radio came to Bismarck and Bud started what turned out to be 10 years of broadcasting ""Bud's Corner'' jazz programs. An avid jazz aficianado all his life, he has a record collection of more than 6,000 albums. He and his family often traveled to jazz festivals and were personally acquainted with many of the jazz greats of the world.<br>
In 1982, the Great Plains Jazz Society was established, with Bud acting as its first president. This was the first non-profit jazz organization in the state and continues to be a forceful power. A free program of jazz in the park was established, which was named in his honor in the 1980s as ""Bud's Jazz in the Park.'' This well-established event annually attracts thousands of people.<br>
Bud was active in the early days of the North Dakota Mental Health Association as its first president, and he transformed the organization from strictly a volunteer group to a staffed organization with real force. He was the first representative to the National Association of Mental Health, whose president was Mrs. Winthrope Rockefeller with other leaders, including Mrs. du Pont.<br>
As a fledgling organization, he and Charles Conrad started a class action lawsuit to gain education rights for the mentally handicapped, which they won. They also pioneered local treatment for the mentally ill, where previously everyone had been sent to Jamestown. Other lawsuits followed but eventually they gained legislative support and started the first mental health clinic in North Dakota, which was one of the first in the nation. Their legislation pioneered mental health services nationwide and was used by the U.S. Congress as a basis for the National Bill for Mental Health.<br>
The Dacotah Foundation, a non-profit organization established in 1970, was another board he served on until his death as many-time president and legal counsel. The Dacotah Foundation is nationally recognized as a progressive and exemplary organization and continues to serve as an active bridge between the public and private sector as help for the mentally ill.<br>
In 1960, he became a board member of the Bismarck Hospital, now Medcenter One, acting as secretary of the board for more than 30 years and as attorney for more than 25 years. He was very involved with helping the hospital, which grew immensely in size and staff, with numerous bond issues providing funds for expansion of facilities and services.<br>
He also was a board member and legal counsel for the Missouri Slope Nursing Home, North Dakota Child Welfare and the North Dakota Board of Nursing.<br>
In the 1970s Bud, in consultation with Gabriel J. Brown, initiated and established the Gabriel J. Brown Trust, a private non-profit foundation that annually grants more than $100,000 in educational loans to North Dakota students.<br>
Bud was a great thinker and supporter of the arts, including the Bismarck Art and Galleries Association where he was a major contributor and responsible for initiating meetings leading to BAGA's successful ownership of part of their building.<br>
Along with his family, he brainstormed and established Sleepy Hollow Summer Theatre in 1990, which filled a need for educational summer involvement in the arts for students aged 6-20. As an excellent planner, he visualized and brought forces together for the financing and construction of major facilities at the park as well as the execution of educational classes and musical theater productions. More than 60,000 people have been involved in this program.<br>
He also was major counsel for ""Friends of the Belle,'' chaired by his daughter, Susan, which successfully passed the $2.4 million sales tax vote by 65 percent and raised an additional $100,000 in funds to complete the facility as planned by the arts community.<br>
For his contributions to the arts, he and his family received the Honor Citation Award from the Bismarck Arts and Galleries Association and he was recognized as an outstanding community person in 1991 by the Bismarck Tribune.<br>
He and his family have been members of Trinity Lutheran Church for more than 40 years.<br>
His desire to ""come back'' after a stroke in 1989, staph infection in 1993 and several surgeries in the last two months showed how hard he fought to recover. He did not allow his body's limitations to govern the spirit and breadth of his very active mind.<br>
As a man of extraordinary integrity and civility, he had a strong sense of community. He believed that the most important word in the English language was ""duty'' to one's country, community and family, and ""ego'' was the most destructive word. His life of quiet servitude exemplified his commitments.<br>
His immediate family include his wife, Evelyn; two daughters and one son-in-law, Susan Lundberg , and Stephanie and Bill Delmore; and two grandchildren, Melissa Lundberg and Shane Delmore.<br>
In lieu of flowers, his family wishes memorials be given to the two art organizations in which he was so insturmental: The Great Plains Jazz Society and Sleepy Hollow Summer Theatre.<br>

Norman, Dad, Grandpa and Papa: Although you may not have realized it, you were an inspiration to all of us. What was it that made your life so full and special? You truly loved your wife, children, grand children and great-grand children. You always strived to love, teach and to provide a strong legacy for us, showing deep pride knowing weʼd learned a lesson you had tried to teach us and in everything we accomplished or achieved. Your smile was the gratitude and recognition that we all looked for, because we knew coming from you that was always "high praise." You always welcomed a set of younger feet that filed through that front door and looked forward to the hugs and kisses to follow. We will miss your presence, but will cherish all the "treasures" that you have allowed us to bring along on our walk of life. All of us will miss you dearly ... Love you.<br>
