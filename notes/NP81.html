Las Vegas Review-Journal, 13 September 2013<br>
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
Many  things can be said about Norma Lee Bruner. Known to friends and acquaintances as a friendly, energetic, empathic and fun loving woman. Her compassionate nature would always shine through, revealing her charm, warmth and caring demeanor. She was warmhearted, gentle and organized in all the things she sought to accomplish. Norma was a mentor, a natural "teacher" capable of seeing things clearly, leading others and bringing out the best in all of those around her.<br>
      Norma was born on April 6, 1930 at home in Tishomingo, Oklahoma. Her parents were Essie and Edgar Chapman. Norma was raised in Norman, Oklahoma. When she was young, Norma's friends and family found that "straightforward" and "precocious" were perfect words to describe her. Even as a child, Norma demonstrated strong qualities of self-confidence, perceptive ability and a strong spiritual-nature.<br>
      Norma grew up with four siblings. She had three older brothers Edgar Jr, Melvin, Richard, and one older sister Hazel. Norma was constantly involved in all sorts of activities with her family. She was fun loving, full of humor, and loved by all she came in contact with. She enjoyed stirring the pot and getting a rise out of everyone. Norma carried these traits into her adult life and served as one of many reasons why family and friends found her delightful to be around. Norma was a person who genuinely understood and cared for others, making powerful connections with those she knew.<br>
      As a young girl, Norma was imaginative, ingenious, clever and a "novel" thinker. Regardless of whether her peers were older or younger, or came from different backgrounds, Norma could easily relate to other kids. In her spare time she liked riding horses. However, to Norma, the most fun to be had was simply playing and spending time with her many friends.<br>
      During her high school years, Norma had a natural flair for cheering on and applauding just about everyone. She was constantly offering her support and encouragement to fellow members of the groups and activities in which she participated. She did well in school and genuinely enjoyed telling stories in a way that drew people to her. In this way, Norma had a talent for becoming the center of attention, a kind of social catalyst. Norma was often found to be the lead person facilitating a group activity, frequently filling the role of being "the life of the party." Teachers and classmates knew Norma as an excellent listener. She placed a high value on learning and always understood that there was a new lesson to be grasped waiting for her just around the corner. The teacher she enjoyed learning from the most was Patricia Vorhees. <br>
      Norma enjoyed college, she earned her Bachelor of Science in Education. Her favorite courses were music and home economics. Norma lettered in softball and planned as well as participated in the school dances. The skill of being a good communicator helped Norma immensely during her college days. She was comfortable with abstract information and theories and tended to thrive on the subjects that forced her to think. No matter what class it was, Norma was always very perceptive and embraced the mental challenges that her college experience provided.<br>
      Always considered a "good" friend, Norma sought to understand the things that others enjoyed. For this reason Norma always seemed to possess a never-ending collection of acquaintances. Norma's friends found her easy to know and get along with because of her talent for being socially at ease, adept at conversation, and always amiable in her dealings with others. Norma would always seek to learn what her friends enjoyed, and she would go out of her way to make sure that their needs were met. Norma was always seen as the type of person who was the more gracious giver. In fact, she sometimes felt ill at ease when she was the one on the receiving end. Throughout her life she had many friends, one of her best friends in life was Wanda Rhodes.<br>
      On June 25, 1953 Norma married William Alonzo Bruner in her brother's backyard garden in Albuquerque, New Mexico. Compassionate and devoted, Norma worked hard to make her new family happy. She was always generous with her time and this meant that Bill came first in Normaʼs book. She was always caring and made certain that she considered Billʼs feelings. By trusting her emotions, Norma did her best to make sure that both the marriage and home life ran smoothly. <br>
      Norma's quality of being a caring person who was very accepting of others translated to being a good mother to her children. Norma shared these values with her three children, Mike,Gary, and Judi. Norma was also blessed with six grandchildren, Chris, Eric, Neil, Rebecca, Jon, Brandin, adopted granddaughter Sydney, and one great-granddaughter Shyla. Norma related well to children of all ages and was able to connect to them on their level. The children always loved her and she was completely and totally devoted to them.<br>
      Norma experienced success in her work life over and over again. Her primary occupation was a school teacher. She concluded her career at JFK High School in Richmond, California after 15 years of employment. Norma always made the effort to understand what was needed at work, and was well known by her colleagues as a team player. Norma took pride in truly connecting with her students. Norma was one to take the initiative and her skills at working cooperatively were highly valued.<br>
      Norma derived much satisfaction from sports. Because she was so instinctive and could always grasp the big picture, Norma delighted in the strategy and inner workings of a competition. In high school, Norma played basketball. In her college years, Norma continued to stay active by participating in softball and basketball. As Norma grew older her favorite recreational sports included bowling, golfing, and swimming. And if playing the slots were a sport, she would be an Olympic gold medalist. Norma was also something of a sports fan and enjoyed watching her favorite teams' events whenever she got the opportunity. Tops on her list were basketball and football... GO BOOM-A-SOONERS!<br>
      Throughout her life, Norma was actively involved in professional and community organizations. With a talent for focusing in on exactly what was required to be completed, Norma was known to her peers as being able to strengthen any group endeavor. When called on, Norma was a natural leader who created harmony and good relationships within the group, often putting her own needs aside. In high school, Norma was a member of the band, the trio, and the operetta. In college, Norma joined the band and the Alpha Delta Pi Sorority. Throughout her later years, Norma was an active member of the Richmond Auxiliary Club.<br>
      Norma's faith was important to her. She was a member of the Presbyterian Church. During that time, she was a member of the choir and at one point the choir leader. She was compassionate and warm hearted, someone who truly cared for others and that was clearly demonstrated in her work with the congregation.<br>
      Norma enjoyed traveling, and took on all the responsibility of planning and scheduling all of the family vacations. Her gift for keeping things lively meant that vacations with Norma were always enjoyable. Some of her favorite vacations included Hawaii, Italy, the Bahamas, and Australia.<br>
      Norma was a lover of animals and cherished her pets. One of Norma's favorite was Misty Blue, a Siamese cat. They were best friends for 21 years.<br>
      When Norma's retirement finally came in 1968, she embraced her new career of full-time wife and mother. Even in retirement, Norma continued to stay in touch with her past colleagues and made plenty of new acquaintances. Focusing all of her time and energy on her husband's career and the well-being of their children was her life dream fulfilled. <br>
       Norma, a breast cancer survivor, fought a brave battle against her most recent cancer and passed on September 7, 2013. She is survived by her husband Bill; her children Mike, Gary, and Judi; daughters-in-law Judy and Ellen; grandchildren Chris, Eric, Neil, Rebecca, Jon, and Brandin; adopted granddaughter Sydney; and her great-granddaughter Shyla. Services were held at Palm Northwest Mortuary. Norma was laid to rest in Bunkers Memory Gardens in Las Vegas, Nevada.<br>
      Throughout her life, Norma was a gregarious and enthusiastic woman. She was generous to a fault, giving to and helping those she loved. She was imaginative, original, tender hearted and easy to get along with. Norma leaves behind her a legacy of life-long friendships and cherished memories. Everyone whose lives she touched will dearly remember Norma Lee Bruner.<br>

 CHARLEMAGNE
<p>
<a name ="I004763"><b>[I004763]</b></a><br />
Charlemagne, or Charles the Great, CAROLINGIAN king of the FRANKS, came to rule over most of Europe and assumed (800) the title of Roman emperor. He is sometimes regarded as the founder of the HOLY ROMAN EMPIRE. In 768 he and his brother Carloman inherited the Frankish kingdom (most of present-day France and a part of western Germany) from their father PEPIN THE SHORT. The entire kingdom passed to Charlemagne when Carloman died in 771. He inherited great wealth and a strong military organization from his father and brother. He used these assets to double the territory under Carolingian control. In 772 he opened his offensive against the SAXONS, and for more than three decades he pursued a ruthless policy aimed at subjugating them and converting them to Christianity. Almost every year Charlemagne attacked one or another region of Saxon territory. --4,500 Saxons were executed on a single day in 782--and deportations were used to discourage the stubborn. The Saxons proved to be a far more difficult enemy than any of the other peoples subjugated by Charlemagne. For example, the LOMBARDS were conquered in a single extended campaign 773-74), after which Charlemagne assumed the title "king of the Lombards." In 788 he absorbed the duchy of Bavaria, and soon thereafter he launched an offensive against the AVAR empire. The Avars succumbed within a decade, yielding Charlemagne a vast hoard of gold and silver. After one disastrous campaign (778) against the Muslims in Spain, Charlemagne left the southwestern front to his son Louis, (later Emperor LOUIS I) who, with the help of local Christian rulers, conquered Barcelona in 801 and controlled much of Catalonia by 814. On Christmas Day, 800, Charlemagne accepted the title of emperor and was crowned by Pope LEO III. For several years after he regarded the imperial title of being of little value. Moreover, he intended to divide his lands and titles among his sons, as was the Frankish custom. At his death on Jan. 28, 814, however, only one son, Louis, survived; Louis therefore assumed control of the entire Frankish empire.<br>
<br>
From Wikipedia<br>
<br>
Charlemagne (c. 742 or 747 - January 28, 814) (or Charles the Great, in German Karl der Große, in Latin Carolus Magnus, giving rise to the adjective form "Carolingian"), was king of the Franks from 771 to 814, King of the Lombards since 774, and the renewer of the Western Empire. His dual role as Emperor - Imperator Augustus - and King of the Franks provides the historical link beetween the Imperial dignity and the Frankish kingdoms and later Germany. Today both France and Germany look unto him as a founding figure of their respective countries.<br>
<br>
Date of birth<br>
Charlemagne's birthday was believed to be April 1, 742, but several factors led to reconsideration of this traditional date. First, the year 742 was calculated from his age given at death, rather than attested with primary sources. Second, 742 precedes the marriage of his parents (in 744), yet there is no indication that Charlemagne was born out of wedlock, and he inherited from his parents. Another date is given in the Annales Petarienses, the April 2, 747. In that year, April 1 is Easter. The birth of an Emperor on Easter is a coincidence likely to provoke comment, but there is no such comment documented in 747, leading some to suspect the Easter birthday was a pious fiction concocted as a way of honoring the Emperor. Other commentators weighing the primary records have suggested that the birth was one year later, 748. So at present, it is impossible to be certain of the date of the birth of Charlemagne. The best guesses include April 1, 747, after April 15, 747, or April 1, 748.<br>
<br>
<br>
Life<br>
Charlemagne was the elder son of Pippin the Younger (714 - September 24, 768, reigned 751 - 768) and his wife Bertrada of Laon (720 - July 12, 783); he was the brother of the Lady Bertha mother of Roland.<br>
Charles, eldest Son of King Pippin, receives the News of the Death of his Father and the Great Feudalists offer him the Crown.--Costumes of the Court of Burgundy in the Fifteenth Century.--Fac-simile of a Miniature of the "History of the Emperors" (Library of the Arsenal).<br>
<br>
On the death of Pippin the kingdom was divided between Charlemagne and his brother Carloman. Charles took the outer parts of the kingdom, bordering on the sea, namely Neustria, Aquitania]] and the norhtern parts of Austrasia, while Carloman attained the inner parts, bordering on Italy.<br>
<br>
Carloman died on the 5th of December, 771, leaving Charlemagne the leader of a reunified Frankish kingdom.<br>
<br>
Shortly after that, he marched against the Lombards in Italy. In 774 he deposed their king Desiderius and was himself crowned king of the Lombards, permanently unifying the kingdom of Italy to the Frankish crown.<br>
<br>
Charlemagne was engaged in almost constant battle throughout his reign. After thirty years of war and 18 battles, he conquered Saxony, a goal that had been the unattainable dream of Augustus, and proceeded to convert the conquered to Catholic Christianity, using force where necessary. He dreamed of the reconquest of Spain, but never fully succeeded in this goal.<br>
<br>
In 797 (801?) the caliph of Baghdad, Harun al-Rashid, gave Emperor Charlemagne the first historically recorded elephant in northern Europe, named Abul-Abbas, an Asian elephant. (See History of elephants in Europe.)<br>
<br>
In 800, at Mass on Christmas day in Rome, Pope Leo III crowned Charlemagne Imperator Romanorum (Emperor of the Romans). Though this, according to the sources, occured against his intentions, Charles thus became the renewer of the Western Empire, that had expired in the 5th century. To avoid frictions with the Eastern Emperor, Charles later called himself not Imperator Romanorum (a title reserved for the Eastern Emperor), but rather as Imperator Romanum gubernans Imperium (Emperor ruling the Roman Empire).<br>
<br>
Pursuing his father's reforms, Charlemagne did away with the monetary system based on the gold sou. Both he and King Offa of Mercia took up the system set in place by Pippin. He set up a new standard, the livre (i.e. pound)- both monetary and unit of weight- which was worth 20 sous (like the solidus, and later the shilling) or 240 deniers (like the denari, and eventually the penny). During this period, the livre and the sou were counting units, only the denier was a coin of the realm.<br>
<br>
Charlemagne applied the system to much of the European Continent, and Offa's standard was voluntarily adopted by much of England.<br>
<br>
Charlemagne organized his empire into 350 counties, each led by an appointed count. Counts served as judges, administrators, and enforced capitularies. To enforce loyalty, he set up the system of Missi Dominici, meaning 'Envoys of the Lord.' In this system, one representative of the church and one representative of the emperor would head to the different counties and every year report back to Charlemagne on their status.<br>
<br>
When Charlemagne died in 814, he was buried in his own Cathedral at Aachen. He was succeeded by his only son to survive him, Louis the Pious, after whose reign the empire was divided between his three surviving sons according to Frankish tradition. These three kingdoms would be the foundations of later France and the Holy Roman Empire.<br>
<br>
After Charlemagne's death, continental coinage degraded and most of Europe resorted to using the continued high quality English coin until about 1100.<br>
<br>
It is difficult to understand Charlemagne's attitude toward his daughters. None of them contracted a sacramental marriage. This may have been an attempt to control the number of potential alliances. After his death the surviving daughters entered or were forced to enter monasteries. At least one of them, Bertha, had a recognized relationship, if not a marriage, with Angilbert, a member of Charlemagne's court circle.<br>
<br>
Charlemagne's mother tongue was the Old High German dialect called Frankish. He also spoke Latin and understood some Greek.<br>
<br>
Cultural significance<br>
harlemagne's reign is often referred to as the Carolingian Renaissance because of the flowering of scholarship, literature, art and architecture. Most of the surviving works of classical Latin were copied and preserved by Carolingian scholars. The pan-European nature of Charlemagne's influence is indicated by the origins of many of the men who worked for him: Alcuin, an Anglo-Saxon; Theodulf, a Visigoth; Paul the Deacon, a Lombard; and Angilbert and Einhard, Franks. Charlemagne enjoyed an important afterlife in European culture. One of the great medieval literature cycles, the Charlemagne cycle or Matter of France, centres around the deeds of Charlemagne's historical commander of the Breton border, Roland, and the paladins who served as a counterpart to the knights of the Round Table; their tales were first told in the chansons de geste. Charlemagne himself was accorded sainthood inside the Holy Roman Empire after the 12th Century. His canonization by Antipope Paschal III was never recognized by the Holy See. He was a model knight as one of the Nine Worthies.<br>
<br>
It is frequently claimed by genealogists that all people with European ancestry alive today are probably descended from Charlemagne. However, only a small percentage can actually prove descent from him. Charlemagne's marriage and relationship politics and ethics did, however, result in a fairly large number of descendants, all of whom had far better life expectancies than is usually the case for children in that time period. They were married into houses of nobility and as a result of intermarriages many people of noble descent can indeed trace their ancestry back to Charlemagne.<br>
<br>
Another interesting note about Charlemagne was that he took a serious effort in his and others' scholarship and had learned to read in his adulthood, although he never quite learned how to write. This was quite an achievement for kings at this time, of whom most were illiterate.<br>
