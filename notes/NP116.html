William M. DARLING
<p>
<a name ="I119376"><b>[I119376]</b></a><br />
William Darling, Jr. was born in Washington, DC to Louise Anderson Darling and William M. Darling, a DC printer. A telling, early fascination with airplanes and flight lead a grade school age Bill to sneak off to pay five dollars to the pilot of a 2-seater plane for his first airplane flight from the fields around DC.<br>
He graduated from Central High School, then from the University of Maryland in 1941 with a BS in Mechanical Engineering, focus on aeronautical engineering. He immediately found work as a civilian at the Special Weapons Branch of the Army Air Corps at Wright Field in Dayton, Ohio. His work was centered on designing and testing the aerodynamics of the glide bomb prototypes in a race to catch up with German weaponry.<br>
After the start of the war, Bill joined the Army Air Corps (now the Air Force.) After training, he was sent to an airbase in La Junta, Colorado, and assigned to a B-25 bomber squad. During this time, he met, fell in love and married the love of his life, Patricia Stedman in September of 1943.<br>
Instead of being deployed to the Pacific, Bill's old bosses at the Special Weapons Branch had him ordered back to Wright Field because they could not replace him on the glide bomb project. He and Patti moved back to Dayton, where their son William III was born in August of 1944. His work there included a crash program to replicate an unexploded German Buzz Bomb recovered in London, which they were able to manufacture by the war's end.<br>
In 1946, with the birth of their son, John, and Bill's discharge from the Air Force, the family moved to Los Angeles and Bill began his career with North American Aviation. His first work was on a missile known as the Navaho, whose rocket engines, guidance system and vehicle design laid the groundwork for rocket development for the next several years. Bill and Patti's third son, Douglass, was born during this time, in 1949.<br>
By the 1960's, Bill was Vice President of contracts and pricing at North American during the space exploration years. He was rightfully proud to have been a part of the success achieved in the Mercury Space Capsule, Apollo Command Module and the Space Shuttle Orbiter programs.<br>
It was during these heady years that Bill and Patti developed a life long love affair with Hawaii, especially a patch of Waikiki, where every October they would gather under a tree with a diverse group of friends to enjoy the sun and warm water. When they discovered the joy and peace they felt on the ocean, they learned to sail. Their first boat was a Lido 14, and later they had a beautiful wooden Herreshoff 28 built for them. Some of the family's fondest memories are of sailing the South Bay and trips to Catalina's Avalon and the Isthmus. Bill and Patti maintained strong friendships with the boating community in King Harbor, friendships that continued long after they gave up their boat.<br>
After Bill retired, it was not long before the joys of grandchildren began to arrive in numbers. First son Bill and his then wife Charlene's boy, John, then son John and wife Karen's boys Eric and Kyle, followed by son Doug and wife Ann's daughter, Kate, and son, Peter. The babysitting, beach days, sleepovers, soccer games and sailing trips filled Bill and Patti's days and helped to ease the pain they felt when their son John passed away in 1984. In the past few years, the arrival of great granddaughters Whitney (John and Angela) and Elle and Alice, (Kyle and Sara) brought special delight to "Great Grandpa Bill."<br>
On May 5, 2018, William passed away peacefully with family at his side. No services are being planned at this time. Please sign the guest book at www.dailybreeze.com/obits<br>

GEORGE DARNELL ELECTROCUTED<br>
FRUITLAND MAN KILLED WHILE TRYING TO PUT OUT FIRE ON POWER LINE POLE<br>
George Darnell, ditch rider for the Farmers' ditch company, was instantly killed Monday morning by contacting with the current of a power line. He was burning trash along the ditch and when an electric power line pole caught fire he went to the ditch and brought a bucket of water with which to extinguish the flames. In throwing the water against the pole contact was formed, as water is a conductor, and the current passed through his body killing him instantly. The hand which held the water bucket and one of his heels, in which there were heavy nails, were burned, showing that the current passed through the body from the hand to the foot. His helper was near by and saw the accident and his body fall, but when he reached the unfortunate man life was extinct.<br>
