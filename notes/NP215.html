Olaf GUDRØDSON
<p>
<a name ="I007653"><b>[I007653]</b></a><br />
From Wikipedia<br>
<br>
Olaf Gudrødsson, or as he was named after his death Olaf Geirstad-Alf, was a legendary Norwegian king of the House of Yngling from the Ynglinga saga. He was the son of Gudrød the Hunter and the brother of Halfdan the Black. Gudrød and Olaf conquered a large part of Raumarike.<br>
<br>
Gudrød died when Olaf was twenty years old and he and Halfdan divided their kingdom between them. Olaf took the southern part and resided in Geirstad. They only inherited the Westfold because Alfgeir took Vingulmark for himself and made his son Gandalf Alfgeirsson its king.<br>
<br>
The Ynglinga saga relates that Olaf was a skillful man and a great warrior. He was also handsome, big and strong.<br>
<br>
During the reigns of Olaf and his brother Halfdan the Black, Värmland started to pay tribute to the Swedish king Erik Anundsson instead.<br>
<br>
Olaf was the father of Ragnvald the Mountain-High and he died of illness.<br>
<br>
Tjodolf of Hvin sang about Olaf:<br>
    Long while this branch of Odin's stem<br>
    Was the stout prop of Norway's realm;<br>
    Long while King Olaf with just pride<br>
    Ruled over Westfold far and wide.<br>
    At length by cruel gout oppressed,<br>
    The good King Olaf sank to rest:<br>
    His body now lies under ground,<br>
    Buried at Geirstad, in the mound.<br>
<br>
After his death, he was worshipped as an elf, and was called the Geirstad-alf, the "elf of Geirstad".<br>
<br>
A hypothesis identifies Geirstad with Gjerstad near Gokstad, and his burial with the Gokstad Ship.<br>

Halfdan GUDRØDSSON
<p>
<a name ="I008100"><b>[I008100]</b></a><br />
Halfdan the Black Gudrødsson (820 - 860) (Old Norse: Hálfdan svarti, Norwegian: Halvdan Svarte) was the father of the first King of Norway Harald I and of the House of Yngling.<br>
<br>
His father was King Gudröd the Hunter, and his brother Olaf Geirstad-Alf.<br>
<br>
The saga of Halfdan the Black tells the following story:<br>
<br>
Halfdan's mother was named Åsa. She was the daughter of King Harald of Agder. When Halfdan's father was killed, Åsa took the year-old Halfdan and returned to Agder, where Halfdan grew up.<br>
<br>
In 838, when he was eighteen years old, Halfdan became king of Agder. He quickly began adding to his kingdom through political negotiation and military conquest. He divided the kingdom of Vestfold with his brother Olaf and, through military action, persuaded King Gandalf of Vingulmark to cede half his kingdom.<br>
<br>
Next, Halfdan subdued an area called Raumarike. To secure his claim to Raumarike, Halfdan first defeated and killed Sigtryg, the previous ruler, in battle, then defeated Sigtryg's brother and successor Eystein in a series of battles. This established Halfdan's claim not only to Raumarike, but also to half of Hedemark, Sigtryg and Eystein's core kingdom.<br>
<br>
Halfdan first wife was Ragnhild, daughter of King Harald Gulskeg (Goldbeard) of Sogn. Halfdan and Ragnhild had a son named Harald after his grandfather, and they sent him to be raised in his grandfather's court. Harald Gulskeg, being elderly, named his grandson as his successor shortly before his death. Ragnhild died shortly after her father and the young king Harald fell sick and died the next spring. When he heard about his son's death, Halfdan traveled to Sogn and laid claim to the title of king. No resistance was offered and Halfdan added Sogn to his realm.<br>
<br>
The sons of Gandalf of Vingulmark, Hysing, Helsing, and Hake, attempted to ambush Halfdan at night but he escaped into the forest. After raising an army, he returned and defeated the brothers, killing Hysing and Helsing. Hake fled from the country and Halfdan became king of all of Vingulmark.<br>
<br>
Halfdan's second wife was also named Ragnhild. She was the daughter of Sigurd Hjort, king of Ringerike. She was kidnapped from her home by Hake, a berserker who encountered her father in Hadeland and killed him. In turn, Halfdan had her kidnapped from Hake so that he could marry her. Ragnhild and Halfdan had a son who was also named Harald.<br>
<br>
Halfdan died when he fell through the ice of a lake that had been weakened by cattle dung after a hole was cut in the ice for the cattle to drink. Each of the districts of his kingdom wanted to claim his grave. In the end, it was agreed to divide his body into four pieces so each district could bury a piece of it, resulting in Halfdan's Mounds.<br>

Death of Gen. George M. Guion <br>
Seneca Falls, Nov. 10. - General George M. Guion died at his home in Colorado Springs yesterday and from a dispatch which relatives here received at 11 o'clock. It is thought that the remains will be buried at that place, tomorrow afternoon. General Guion raised a company of volunteers in this village at the breaking out of the Civil war and in the New York brigade he won distinction and was advanced to the rank of general. He was for years after the war a prominent resident of the village. About 18 years ago he moved to Chicago and from there, to Colorado Springs. He leaves two nephews, John and Edward Guion of this village.<br>

GEORGE MURRAY GUION.  <br>
Colonel United States Volunteers. Died at Colorado Springs, Colorado, November 9, 1910.  <br>
Again we are called to record the passing of one of our best loved companions. The records of the Civil War contain few names of more worth as a citizen soldier than that of George Murray Guion, who died at Colorado Springs, Colorado, November 9th, 1910.  <br>
George Murray Guion, son of the Rev. John Marshall Guion, S. T. D., was born in Meriden, Connecticut, June 28th, 1836. He was a direct descendant of Louis Guion, Huguenot, who settled in America about 1687.  <br>
In 1840 he moved with his parents to New Britain, where he lived until 1854. Three years were spent in New Haven and New York, and in 1857, with other members of his father's family, he settled in Seneca Falls, New York, and there engaged in the drug business.  <br>
At the outbreak of the Civil War, having organized a company at Seneca Falls, he was mustered as Captain May 9th, 1861, and proceeded with his company to the rendezvous at Elmira, where it became Co. A of the 33rd N. Y.  <br>
In July following his regiment was ordered to Washing- ton and assigned to Gen. W. F. Smith's Brigade, which afterwards became the 3rd Brigade 2nd Div. 6th Corps.  <br>
He served in the 6th Corps, Army of the Potomac, through the Peninsular and Maryland campaigns in 1862, and in the 18th Corps, Army of the James, during the movement against Richmond, and the siege of Petersburg in 1864.  <br>
He also commanded a successful expedition from York- town to Matthews C. H., and Gwynn's Island in 1863. At the battle of Williamsburg his regiment (temporarily as- signed to Hancock) took the lead in the famous charge on the right, and for its action in that engagement was, by special order of Gen. McClellan, authorized to inscribe "Williamsburg" upon its banners, being the first volunteer regiment in the Army of the Potomac thus honored.  <br>
In September, 1862, just before the battle of Antietam, he was commissioned Lieut. Colonel of the 148th, but refused to leave his old comrades until the great battle had been fought and the enemy driven back across the Potomac. In this memorable engagement, Capt. Guion was severely wounded.  <br>
As Lieut. Colonel he joined his regiment at Norfolk, Va., in Dix's 7th Corps, being assigned to the city defenses and outpost duty. In 1863 he was promoted to the Colonelcy of his regiment, and stationed at Yorktown, remaining there until April, 1864, when the 148th became part of the 2nd Brigade, 2nd Div. of Smith's 18th Corps. He was assigned to the command of this Brigade in August, 1864, and retained the command until he resigned his commission and was honorably discharged Oct. 16th, 1864. As Captain in the 33rd N. Y. he took an active part in the following engagements: Lewinsville, Va., Sept. 11th, 1861; Lee's Mills, April 4th, 1862 ; Siege of Yorktown, April 5th to May 4th ; Williamsburg, May 5th; Mechanicsville, May 24th; Gaines Mills, June 27th; Chickahominy, June 28th; Savage Station, June 29th; White Oak Swamp, June 30th; Malvern Hill, July 1st; Second Bull Run, August 30th; South Mountain, Md., Sept. 14th; Antietam, Sept. 17th.  <br>
As Colonel of the 148th N. Y. he was in command of his regiment at Swift Creek, Va., May 9th, 1864; Proctor's Creek, May 14th; Drewry's Bluff, May 15th; Port Walt- hall, May 26th; Cold Harbor, June 3rd; Rowlett's House, June 15th ; Siege of Petersburg, June 15th to Aug. 25th.  As Brigade Commander he was engaged in the attack on Fort Gilmore and the capture of Fort Harrison and the line of works at Chaffin's Farm, near Richmond, and in the repulse of Beauregard's attempt to recapture the fort in September, 1864. Upon his return from the Army he was- appointed by Gov. Seymour Brigadier General in the National Guard of the State of New York.  <br>
He was married February 19th, 1863, to Adelaide Cornelia, daughter of Erastus Partridge, a prominent merchant and banker of Seneca Falls, and to them were born two daughters and one son, Adelaide Murray (Mrs. James Platt Hubbell), since deceased, Elizabeth De Lancey (Mrs. Hamilton Garnsey) and LeRoy Partridge.  <br>
With his family he came to Chicago in 1891 and was elected a Companion of the First Class of the Military Order of the Loyal Legion of the United States, through the Commandery of the State of Illinois, April 14th, 1892, his insignia number being 9484.  <br>
In 1906 he removed to Colorado Springs, Colorado, where he died on November 9th, 1910.  He is survived by his widow, one daughter and his son.  <br>
During 1905 and 1906 Colonel Guion was a member of the Library Committee of the Commandery of Illinois, where he endeared himself to his Companions by his gentle manners and accurate knowledge of the records and events of the war.  <br>
Upon leaving Chicago for Colorado Springs he enriched the library of the Commandery by generous and valuable contributions from his own collection.  <br>
He was indeed a "very perfect gentile knight," in his personality bearing proof that "the bravest are the tenderest, the loving are the daring."  <br>

John Marshall GUION
<p>
<a name ="I015697"><b>[I015697]</b></a><br />
He was a graduate of Columbia College in 1826 and the General Theological Seminary in 1829.  For a time he was associated with Dr CRIEHGTON as assistant minister of St. Mark's Church in New York City (Also known as "St Mark's in the Bowery")/  Later he became rector of parishes in Saybrook, Meriden, and New Britain, Connecticut.  In 1853 he accepted a call to become assistant minister of St Paul's in Baltimore, Md., remaining there until the destruction of the church by fire the following year.  While in Baltimore he officated upon various occasions for the Chaplain of the United States Senate.  In the year 1855 he accepted a call to the rectorship of Trinity Chuch at Seneca Falls, New York remaining there up to the time of his death in 1878.  His degree of S. T. D. was conferred by Columbia College in 1865.<br>
------------------------------------------<br>
From the History of Seneca County New York, 1876<br>
The Rev. Doctor John M. GUION, has supplied a valuable lesson not only to those of like profession but to society in general.  John Marshall Guion, son of Elijah Guion, was born in New York City, on February 22, 1801.  He is descended from those Huguenots of France who were so inflexible for religious right and illustrious for their nobility of character.  His ancestors emigrated from France and settled at New Rochelle, in 1689.<br>
Dr. Guion entered Columbia College in 1822, and four years later, having graduated, immediately began a course of theological study at the New York Theological Seminary, which course was completed in 1829.  These seven years were devoted to one object, the sacred ministry, and during the same season in which his preparation was completed, he was ordained deacon, and immediately took charge of the parish at Palmyra, in this State.  Having been advanced to the priesthood in 1830, he took charge of St. Mark's Church in the city of New York, remaining there until 1832, when his marriage to Elizabeth Ives Wheaton, daughter of John R. Wheaton, of New York, was solemnized.<br>
Removing to Connecticut, the parishes of Saybrook, Meriden, and New Britain were successively placed in his charge, for various periods, up to 1853, when he accepted a call to St. Paul's Church, Baltimore, Maryland, and there remained until the destruction of the church edifice, by fire, during the following year.<br>
In 1855, Dr. Guion came to central New York, having been called to the rectorship of Trinity Church, at Seneca Falls.  For twenty-one years the rector of this parish, he has won the affection of those who have attended his ministrations, and though recently retired from active service, his occasional presence in the pulpit is a source of gratification to those who have known him long only to deepen their regard for his personal merit and consistent teachings.  In 1865 the degree of S. T. D. was conferred by his Alma Mater, Columbia College, an honor most worthily bestowed.  The lesson taught by this brief record is one of quiet, unostentatious perseverance.<br>

Addison GULICK
<p>
<a name ="I084878"><b>[I084878]</b></a><br />
Dr. Addison Gulick (4/2/1882 - 9/28/1969) by Dr. Richard Dallam<br>
Professor Gulick was appointed Instructor of Physiology at the University of Missouri School of Medicine in 1912 and was promoted to Assistant Professor, Associate Professor and in 1921 was appointed Professor of Physiology. In 1931, the Department of Physiological Chemistry was established, and Professor Gulick was selected to be its Chairman. he was Professor and Chairman of Physiological Chemistry until his retirement in 1952 at which time he was given the title of Professor Emeritus of Physiological Chemistry. Professor and Mrs. Gulick retired to Cambridge, Massachusetts.<br>
Professor Gulick was born in Osaka, Japan. His parents were both Congregational Missionaries whose mission was largely educational, working with young Japanese boys and girls, and among the scholarly class. He was home schooled by his mother until his parents were move to Hawaii, where he attended high school for two years before finishing at The Oberlin Academy, which was affiliated with Oberlin College in Ohio.<br>
Professor Gulick received a Bachelor of Arts degree from Oberlin College in 1904, with a major in Biology. He receive a Master of Arts degree from Harvard in 1905, with a major in Zoology. He did graduate work in Physiological Chemistry at the University of Strassbourg (Alsace) for two years before receiving his Ph.D."summa cum laude" as a Royal Society of Arts Fellow from the University of Wurzburg (Germany) in 1910, with a major in Zoology.<br>
Professor Gulick was a Teaching Fellow for one year at the University of Toronto, (Canada), 1910-1911, and was appointed Instructor in Physiological Chemistry for one year at the University of Minnesota, 1911-1912.<br>
Professor Gulick was the only member of the Department of Physiology with formal training in chemistry, and was assigned to teach courses offered in not only the Medical School but also in the Graduate School and the College of Arts and Sciences (with the occasional assistance of a Teaching Fellow). Courses he was responsible for during his career included General Physiological Chemistry, Advanced Physiological Chemistry, Toxicology, Advanced Physiology, Research and Journal Club. Following the establishment of the Department of Physiological Chemistry, it wasn't until 1937 that another full time faculty member was appointed in the department.<br>
Professor Gulick's scientific and scholarly interests were influenced to a large extent by his father, the Reverend John Thomas Gulick, Ph.D. Sc.D.. Reverend Gulick was a pioneer missionary to China and the Japan. During all his years of missionary work, his recreation and relaxation came from nature and the prosecution of his scientific studies on the divergent development of the Hawaiian land snails. His results and conclusions were published in a variety of scientific journals and even though he accepted Darwin's point of view of natural selection in general, his own independent researches caused him to challenge Darwin's concept of the working of natural selection. His research compared the effect of inheritable traits and the influence of the environment on biological systems.<br>
There is little doubt that all of his fathers interest in science and religion has an impact on Professor Gulick scholarly endeavors. As a student and throughout his tenure at the University he studied and published in several areas, however, his scientific interests were indirectly or directly focused around projects dealing with genetics, heredity and evolution! As a Ph.D. student, he transferred from the University of Strassbourg only because the research being carried out at the University of Wurzburg was closer to his interests. His Ph.D. thesis was titled Uber die Geschlechtschromosomen bei einigen Nematoden nebst Bemerkungen uber die Bedeuting dieser chromosoman which literally translated is "About the Sex (X and Y) Chromosomes of some Nematodes including a Discussion of the Importance of these Studies." This work was published in Arch. Fur Zellforschung, 6 Band 3 Heft, 1911. During a period when funds for research in biological science was almost non-existent, Professor Gulick turned his research endeavors to studies concerned with how changes in the composition of diets affected the basal metabolism of rats and humans, which had genetic implications. One very extensive non-rat study involved, "A Study of Weight Regulation In The Adult Human Body During Over-Nutrition, " which was published in the American Journal of Physiology 60, 371-395 1922. His question was, "what mechanism (s) is there to prevent the unlimited accumulation of potential energy in the form of an overload of adipose tissue during periods of over-nutrition?" His own heredity constitution indicated that he was derived largely from nonfattening strains, as apposed to the easily fattening type, and therefore, he use himself as the subject, to study basal metabolic changes when on diets of varying composition and calories.<br>
After adhering to a particular diet and a controlled exercise program, periodically he would travel to the Nutrition Laboratory of the Carnegie Institution, where the internationally recognized nutritionist, Dr. F. G. Benedict would have his BMR measured in a chamber that was specifically designed to measure The BMR of humans. His results indicated that even though his caloric intake should have resulted in weight gain, as others had shown with subjects of the easily fattening type, Professor Gulick concluded that there must be genetic factors that regulate how nutrients are utilized in the body. Many years later, Professor Gulick reminisced about this investigation and jokingly stated that the title of the manuscript should have been, "Why I Can't Get Fat!"<br>
During his career, Professor Gulick was recognized nationally, as an intellectual and a scholar (he was capable of reading and translating articles in Sanskrit, Greek, Hebrew, Latin, German, French, Japanese and Spanish into English) and he gained the reputation as an authority on the biochemistry of genetics and evolution. In the 1930's and 1940's he was invited to participate in many symposia, e.g., a Cold Spring Harbor Symposium on Nucleic Acids, and was asked to write review articles on "Genes" and "Chromosomes." One such review was entitled "What are Genes I. The Genetic and Evolutionary Picture. II. The Physico-Chemical Picture; Conclusions, "which was published in the Quart. Rev. Biol. 13(1): 1-18; (2): 140-168 1938. These two papers endeavored to place the problem on genes briefly under combined elucidation from the diverse slants of cytology, genetics, biochemistry, and portions of the evolutionary field of study. He summarized "that even though the structure the gene in unknown, they must be made up of a action and an enzyme-like action which may at time exert hormone-like actions." Another review was "The Chemistry of The Chromosomes," which appeared in Bot. Rev., 7: 433-457, 1941. His exhaustive interpretation of the microchemical reactions, and the nature and configuration of the proteins and nucleic acids of chromosomes. One of his most thorough reviews, "The Chemical Formulation of Gene Structure and Gene Action," appeared in Advances of Enzymology, 4: 1-39, 1944, in which he reviewed 225 articles. His summary of gene structure and gene action included a discussion of protein molecules, autosynthetic molecules, the autosynthetic process, chromatin chemistry, genes as chemical mechanisms, chemical evolution, and chemical paleontological concepts. During this time period in the development of biochemical genetics, Professor Gulick truly was recognized as one of the few that had a grasp of the big picture, which by only a few years, proceeded Avery's discovery of DNA as the true genetic material and of Watson and Crick's deciphering of the structure of DNA.<br>
When funds became available for research, Professor Gulick proceeded to the investigation the biochemistry of isolation nuclei, primarily for liver and thymus. her served as preceptor for the first two doctoral students in the Department, both of whom worked on proteins and minerals of isolated cell nuclei. Dennis T. Mayer (Ph.D. 1938) studied "The Nature of Proteins of Cellular Nuclei" Journal of Biological Chemistry 146, 433-440, 1942. Martin B. Williamson (Ph.D. 1942) investigated "The Calcium and Magnesium of Mammalian Cell Nuclei," Journal of Cellular and Comparative Physiology, 23, 77-82 1944. The research in the department for several years continued to focus on The Acidic Proteins of Cell Nuclei and other aspects of The Chemical Composition of Isolated Cell Nuclei.<br>
During his retirement years, Professor Gulick, frequented the libraries of MIT and Harvard as he continued his keen interest in the developments in Molecular Biology and Genetics; once a scholar always a scholar.<br>

THE REV. ANNA D. GULICK<br>
Wednesday, September 11, 1918- Friday, August 21, 2015 <br>
Randolph was sad to learn of the passing of Anna Gulick. Anna was a near lifelong summer visitor and resident of Randolph-from early childhood staying at the Ravine House with her family, and then for so many years to follow residing at their beloved family cottage "Puckwudjie" on Durand Road that was built by John Boothman in 1923. Anna was an enthusiastic member of the Randolph Mountain Club and a devoted contributor to the Randolph Church. Below is a copy of her obituary: <br>
The Rev. Anna D. Gulick, 96, passed away at home in Wilmore, Kentucky on Aug. 21, 2015. Born to the late Addison and Mary Buckingham Gulick on Sept. 11, 1918 in Boston, MA. She has served as a deacon at Apostles Anglican Church in Lexington since 1996. <br>
 During WWII, Anna served stateside in the U.S. Army Air Corps as a linguist/translator/interpreter. She earned the following degrees: AB, Univ. of Missouri, Columbia, 1941; MA, Univ. of Wisconsin, Madison, 1948; MDiv, Asbury Theological Seminary, 1983. She taught French, English, and German at a number of institutions from 1946-1982, including the Univ. of Missouri, Waldorf Lutheran Junior College (IA), Univ. of Hamamatsu (Japan), Eastern Nazarene College (MA), and Asbury College. At Asbury, she took students to visit French Reformation sites in France and Switzerland and to participate in tent evangelism campaigns in Belgium. She served as a missionary for a decade in post-war Japan.<br>
 After retirement from Asbury, Anna became a spiritual mentor to many seminarians, pastors, and lay people. Her home was always open to international students studying for ministry, and several families lived with her over the years. For the past decade she had a special relationship with the Anglican Church of Uganda, Bishop Nathan Kyamnaywa and his diocese in particular. Anna was devoted to prayer and evangelism. She authored This Bread, This Body , Captured, An Atheistʼs Journey with God, and Windows on the World. <br>
A memorial service was held Friday, Aug. 28th at 11am at Apostles Anglican Church in Lexington, Kentucky. <br>
