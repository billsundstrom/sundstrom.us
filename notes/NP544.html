Gwendolyn Elizabeth THOMSON
<p>
<a name ="I070476"><b>[I070476]</b></a><br />
HOMSON, Gwendolyn "Wendy" So glad to have lived Gwendolyn Thomson, known to most of her friends and family as Wendy, died at her home in Jamaica Plain on May 8 after a long illness. She was 62. Wendy grew up in the narrow streets of Beacon Hill and the woods and fields of Lincoln, and reveled in her childhood summers on Cape Cod. She graduated from Northfield-Mount Herman School and briefly attended Harvard University before leaving to pursue life as, among other things, an artist, activist, executive assistant and organic farmer. Perhaps her proudest accomplishment was returning to school at age 45 to earn a degree in political science at Wellesley College. To all chapters she brought energy, compassion, a drive to help others and a keen appreciation for beauty. Those who knew Wendy knew she didn't have an easy life, and there were times when the challenges almost overwhelmed her, but it was rich and full of great pleasures and in the end, she said, she "was so glad to have lived." A memorial service will be held at 4pm, Saturday, June 10 at King's Chapel, Boston. <br>

Burpee Freeman THORPE
<p>
<a name ="I035967"><b>[I035967]</b></a><br />
      Burpee was a bit of a nomad and traveled several times back and forth from Massachusetts and Ross Corner, Nova Scotia. He was a laborer and farm worker. He developed diabetes late in life necessatating the progressive amputation of his legs.<br>
      Based on conversations with his daughter Irene, we know that Burpee was a very stern disiciplinarian. He would not let his wife and children enjoy a social life outside their home nor engage in certain activities (e.g. playing cards) in the home. He had a harsh temper but "never raised a hand" against his wife or children. They lived "up on the mountain" so seldom went to church down in Kentville.<br>
      He was not a successful farmer and probably lost his farm to creditors or simply walked away from it when he moved his family for the last time to Massachusetts. He worked for other farmers in Westborough and Southboro and was eventually able to purchase a farm of his own in Northboro. However, the hurricane of 1938 swept through the area and desimated the farm. Irene recalled her father having to crawl on his hands and knees to get from the barn to the house in the high winds. He was unable to recover the economic setback and lost the farm to the bank.<br>
      Irene reverred her mother as a saint and blames her father for exposing his wife to a harsh and difficult life. She struggled to feed her family and Irene has specific recollections of Rebecca feeding all the farm hands at lunchtime.<br>
