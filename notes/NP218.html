Lawrence HAGEN
<p>
<a name ="I040754"><b>[I040754]</b></a><br />
Lawrence S. Hagen was the 5th born child to Carl and Nettie Asper Hagen on their Union County farm near Alcester, S.D. on Sept. 8, 1912. He died March 14, 2008 at Pioneer Memorial Nursing Home in Viborg, SD at the age of 95 years, 6 months and 6 days. <br>
He attended Cole School and attended Augustana Normal in Canton. On July 4th, 1930 he married Opal A. Thormodsgard at her family farm in Alcester. Lawrence worked as a hired man for his Uncle Charles Asper until he was able to acquire a team of horses which was a requirement to work on the construction of S.D. Highway 46. After one year of that, he began farming with his brother Arlo, for two years after which he again worked for Aspers and went back to Hwy. 46. Lawrence and his brother-in-law Palmer Thormodsgard started farming at a farm by Moe Church, "The Rice Place" where many memories were made, a house fire, a drowning among many other things. Carl gave Lawrence 2 cows to start his dairy herd and a new Farmall tractor was purchased by Palmer and Lawrence. Sleeping in corn cribs until a new house was built was a challenge with three small children, hired men and sometimes extra guests. One more move to another farm by Hudson was made and then on to the farm by Beresford which was purchased in 1951. <br>
Farming wasn't easy so often Lawrence worked for his brother-in-law building grain elevators in Iowa, Minnesota and S.D. As he wasn't afraid of heights he often did the high jobs and put in very long, hard days away from home doing what many men would not. <br>
After his retirement he spent many hours working in his yard and garden. He worked for the soil conservation office several years planting trees on many of the farms in Lincoln County. In 1978 Lawrence and Opal retired to Beresford. Lawrence did yardwork, odd jobs and enjoyed helping at his daughters' farms whenever he could. He became active in the Beresford Senior Center and loved to play pool, cards and chicken foot dominoes. He regularly attended prayer breakfast at Emmanuel Church in Beresford. <br>
Among Lawrence's many accomplishments he was very proud to have been a spelling champion in 1927 which earned him a train ride to Huron, a state champion baseball player with the 1927 Alcester champions, enjoyed skiing with the grandchildren and golfing when he had a chance. He served on the Pleasant Hill school board, held several offices in Lands church, was the lawn attendant for the Moe Parish Park, church and cemetery which he took a lot of pride in for many years. Lawrence was well known for attending auction sales and usually brought home many treasures and a few useless items which entertained many people. <br>
Lawrence loved to travel and was very good at navigating even in large cities. Visiting his children allowed him to travel many places with friends and relatives usually accompanying him. A highlight of his life was a trip to Norway which allowed him to visit his ancestor's homes and cemeteries which started an obsession with going to cemeteries to learn more about his past. Photos and videotaping became another pastime for Lawrence and he organized over 300 video tapes in later years and enjoyed showing them. Music was a love of his, from Lawrence Welk to Southern gospel. <br>
The family memories are many but one is July 4th with family and friends to celebrate Lawrence and Opals anniversary for 6o years - never missed one get together! A very special granddaughter shared Lawrence's birthday for 45 years - Melanie. Babies and grandchildren were the love of his life. Politics, religion and sales were great topics for conversation and controversy throughout the years. He gave everyone a legacy of cherished memories, a combination of laughter and tears throughout the 95 and  years of his life. <br>
He was preceded in death by his parents, wife, son Wayne (Bud), daughter Virginia Hoben, 2 sons-in-law, Lloyd Knudson and Harry Hoben, a grandchild, a great grandchild, a step-great grandchild, 4 brothers, Arlo, Noble, Norman, and Olaf Palmer, and 3 sisters, Lillian Olson, Elsa Saugstad, and Opal Gullickson. <br>
His survivors include 3 children: Wava (Elmer) Homandberg, Alcester, Glenn (Vonda) Hagen, Sun City, AZ and LeAnn Knudson, Centerville; daughter-in-law Ardy Hagen, Tallahassee, FL; 17 grandchildren, 41 great grandchildren, 7 great, great grandchildren, 2 step-grandchildren and 4 step-great, grandchildren; 2 sisters: Mabel Larsen, Mankato, MN and Doris (Kenneth) Carlson, Alcester; his brother Carlyle (Bonnie) Hagen, Alcester; and many nieces, nephews, relatives and friends. <br>
Funeral services will be held at 2:00PM, Wednesday, March 19, 2008 at Lands Lutheran Church, rural Hudson with burial in the church cemetery. Visitation will be Tuesday from 2PM to 8PM with family present from 6PM to 8PM at Wass Funeral Home in Beresford.<br>

Ferdinand Julius Franz Leopold HAHN
<p>
<a name ="I059405"><b>[I059405]</b></a><br />
When the author of the newspaper article announcing the passing of Ferdinand Hahn used "Death of F.J. Hahn Shocks Community" for its headline, he could not have chosen better words.  Although Hahn was by no means the only individual behind the creation of what was eventually called the Haller Lake Improvement Club, his perseverance and dedication were instrumental in its birth and the eventual construction of its clubhouse.<br>
On July 29, 1921, thirty-six Haller Lake residents gathered at Hahnʼs house, whose address would later be 13053 Meridian Avenue North, and the Haller Lake Improvement Club was born.  Hahn had lived in the community barely a year.  Officers were elected a month later, and by the following January a building committee had already been formed to prepare for construction of a clubhouse.  By the time the club held its first meeting at the clubhouse on June 1, 1923, membership stood at 138 and the club had already successfully secured the installation of sixteen streetlights and other road improvements.  The clubʼs original purpose, to secure the construction of a school, would be fulfilled by 1925, when Haller Lake School opened for the first six grades.  After meeting at Hahnʼs house for nearly two years, the club had many accomplishments under its belt.<br>
Hahn went on to serve two terms as club president, and was instrumental in the creation of the Associated Clubs of the North End, an umbrella organization of improvement clubs throughout neighborhoods just north of Seattle.  The Associated Clubs held their first meeting at the Haller Lake clubhouse on February 4, 1924, largely due to Hahnʼs organizational efforts and the assistance of two other Haller Lake residents, James Moore and Maurice Frank.  Hahn went on to serve as one of Haller Lakeʼs representatives at the Associated Clubsʼ gatherings.<br>
Hahn was born in Berlin, Germany and initially settled in Chicago in 1892.  While residing there, he married, and started an architectural firm with a business partner.  He migrated to Seattle in 1906 to open a branch unit, and took over as sole owner two years later.  After living in the Green Lake district, he moved to the Haller Lake area in 1920.  While examining a blueprint at his office at 358 Nickerson Street on August 30, 1929, Hahn suffered a stroke and collapsed at his bureau.  Only that morning he had remarked to a friend how well he was feeling.  Nevertheless his lifelong wish to die at his desk fully clothed was fulfilled.<br>
Hahnʼs son, Fritz, inherited Ferdinandʼs house, eventually building himself another just to the north in 1949 (1915 N. 133rd).  Around this time, Ferdinandʼs original house was razed.  Ferdinandʼs original house was one of two houses originally constructed between what are today the Ingraham High School playfield and Meridian Avenue North, and N. 130th and N. 133rd Streets. The other house survives as of this writing.  Now bearing the address 1746 N. 130th St., it rests on a parcel heavily reduced by subdivisions.<br>

He was especially fond of witnessing harness races and never missed an opportunity of this recreation. He was always willing to do a good turn for those who needed assistance, and through his genial personality created a vast number of personal friends who will greatly mourn his passing. The generous number of floral pieces at the funeral were a silent tribute to this well known and liked personality.<br>
He is survived by three sons, George Kenneth Haight, of Bridgeport, Conn.; Charles J. Haight, of Mahopac and Howard P. Haight, of Peekskill. Also two daughters, Nellie Haight Brown, of Los Angeles, California, and Pearl Haight Mollicone, of Mahopac, and one brother, Lewis Haight, of Mahopac.

TRAVERSE CITY - "The love that lives in a mother's eyes, shines on undimmed and never dies and this is why my mother's face stays young and holds its gentle grace." - Oral. A Hains Melissa Anne (Hains) Crowell's greatest strength was being a mom, not only to her own children, but to everyone around her. She exemplified that by giving the world her final gift on Aug. 10, 2010. The same day that Melissa passed from this earth, she gave life to her baby, Elizabeth Anne Crowell.Born in Traverse City on May 21, 1968, Missy's inherent ability to care for others was noticed at a young age when she helped to care for her two younger sisters. As she grew up, she shared her love and compassionate soul with the dozens of children who were lucky enough to have her as a babysitter/nanny. Her sense of humor ("nobody could laugh until they cried" harder than she) and kind heart were always present. Where drama existed, she was our peacemaker, our mediator, our "Switzerland," ever neutral and always there to calm the storms. She graduated from Traverse City Central High School in 1986. She went on to receive her Bachelor of Science degree from Central Michigan University, where she was frequently referred to as "Mom" by many who knew her. For the past 14 years she worked at Munson Medical Center, most recently as Admitting Coordinator. On Sept. 23, 1995, she married her best friend, Donald W. Crowell, who survives. Together, they shared the joy of their sons, Forrest, Zacariah, Noah and Jeremiah, and looked forward to the arrival of their first daughter, Elizabeth. Missy's family was her greatest source of pride and her children were the center of everything she did. She is survived by her parents, Larry Hains and Joseph and Marilyn Haines; her sisters, Patty (Don) Tolly, Kristen Hains, Suzann (Clint) Sines and Catherine (Steve) Towers; brother, Robert W. Haines; grandparents, Ann Hains and Marion Steele; nieces and nephews, Timothy and Corbin Sines, Nicholas Hains, Taylor, Christian and Maddie Towers, Lauren Longo, and Stephanie and Chris Tolly; grandchildren, Kennedy and Peyton Crowell; and daughter-in-law, Jennifer Crowell.

Haines.Visitation for friends and family will be today, Aug. 13, from 6 to 8 p.m., at the Reynolds-Jonkhoff Funeral Home.
