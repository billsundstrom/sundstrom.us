Ranulph III DE MESCHINES
<p>
<a name ="I005384"><b>[I005384]</b></a><br />
From Wikipedia<br>
<br>
Ranulph "le Briquessart" le Meschin, Vicomte of Bayeux, 1st Earl of Chester:<br>
<br>
After the Norman conquest of the North of England, he received large grants, including the honor of Appleby, and the city of Carlisle. Some have maintained that he was earl of Carlisle or of Cumberland, but this is probably an error.<br>
<br>
Ranulph also became the largest landholder in Lindsey due to his marriage (ca. 1093) to a woman referred to as "Countess Lucy", (ca. 1079-1138), daughter of (poss) Turold, Sheriff of Lincoln, and (prob) daughter of William Malet, Seigneur de Graville. Her parentage, and who else she married, have been much disputed.<br>

Ansigisel DE METZ
<p>
<a name ="I004772"><b>[I004772]</b></a><br />
Ansegisel, or Duke Angiese  served Sigbert, son of King Dagobert, who ruled 629-639.<br>
</p>
Arnulf DE METZ
<p>
<a name ="I004774"><b>[I004774]</b></a><br />
Arnoul was the 29th. Bishop of Metz, in 612. He was canonized by the Church, Saint Arnoul. He became the Mayor of the Palace of Austrasia, and tutor of Dagobert. In the year 614, when Clotaire II had had Brunehaut killed, he remained the only descendant of the sons of Clovis alive. But he is only a toy in the hands of the Franc aristocracy both lay and ecclesiastic. At the head of each of the three ancient kingdoms, Austrasia, Neustria and Burgundy, the Major Domus [Mayor of the Palace] gains progressively greater importance. On 18 October 614, Clotaire II signed the Edict of Paris which in 27 articles, essentially formed the basic power structure for the Council of Bishops and the Assembly of the Greats [nobles].<br>
<br>
In 623, Clotaire II was pushed by the Bishop of Metz and also Pepin [Le Vieux de Landen] , the Mayor of the Palace to give Austrasia its own King. Thus, Clotaire II's son Dagobert became King of Austrasia and under the tutelage of Arnoul.<br>
<br>
From Wikipedia<br>
<br>
Arnulf of Metz (August 13, 582 - August 16, 640) was a Frankish noble, who had great influence in the Merovingian kingdoms as bishop and was later made a saint.<br>
<br>
Arnulf gave distinguished service at the Austrasian court under Theudebert II (595-612). In 613, however, with Pippin of Landen he led the aristocratic opposition to Queen Brunhilda of Austrasia that led to her downfall and the reunification of Frankish lands under Clotaire II. About the same year, he became Bishop of Metz.<br>
<br>
From 623, again with Pippin, now Mayor of the Austrasian palace, Arnulf was adviser to Dagobert I, before retiring in 627 to become a hermit in the Vosges mountains with his friend Romaric.<br>
<br>
Before he was consecrated, he had three children by his wife, Doda:<br>
    * Ansegisel<br>
    * Chlodulf<br>
    * Martin<br>
<br>
Ansegisel married Pippin's daughter, Begga, and the son of this marriage, Pippin II, was Charlemagne's great-grandfather.<br>
<br>
Arnulf was canonized and is known as the patron saint of brewing. His feast day is either July 18 or August 16. In iconography, he is portrayed with a rake in his hand. He is often confused in the legends with Arnold of Soissons, another patron saint of brewing. He is also known as Saint Arnold.<br>
<br>
Uncertain Ancestry<br>
While Arnulf is recognised as one of the earliest documented ancestors of, say, Charlemagne and thereby most modern European Royal families, Arnulf's own parentage is both uncertain and undocumented:<br>
<br>
    * Some have claimed that Arnulf's father was Arnoldus (b Abt. 535, Saxony, Germany - d. 600), and that his mother was Ada of Schwabia<br>
    * According to Frankish myth, Arnulf was the son of Bodigisel.<br>
    * Others have claimed that Arnulf's mother was Berthe, Princess of Paris (539-640)<br>
    * Still others hold that Arnulf descended from Mellobaude thus:<br>

William DE MONTAGU
<p>
<a name ="I008749"><b>[I008749]</b></a><br />
From Wikipedia,<br>
<br>
William Montacute, 1st Earl of Salisbury, 3rd Baron Montacute (1301-1344) was an English nobleman.<br>
<br>
He was the eldest son of William Montacute, 2nd Baron Montacute, and succeeded his father as baron in 1319.<br>
<br>
Montacute accompanied Edward III in repelling the Scottish invasion of 1327. The next year he served the king on diplomatic missions to the king of France and to the Pope.<br>
<br>
In 1330, at the behest of the king, Montacute and some of his men arrested Roger Mortimer, and after Mortimer's execution Montacute received a good part of the forfeited estates.<br>
<br>
Montacute took part in the Scottish campaigns of the following years, notably at the Battle of Halidon Hill in 1333.<br>
<br>
Also in 1333 the king gave Montacute the English claim to the Isle of Man.<br>
<br>
He was created earl of Salisbury on March 16, 1337.<br>
<br>
In 1338 the new earl went an a lengthy diplomatic mission, first to France to declare king Edward claims to the French crown, and then to visit many of the German princes who might ally against France. Later that year he was made Marshall of England.<br>
<br>
During the next two years he was one of the commanders of the English forces in Flanders, until he was captured by the French near Lille. He was released later in 1340 as part of a prisoner exchange, on the condition that he never again fight against the French.<br>
<br>
It was probably sometime after his return to England that he conquered the Isle of Man, which had been held by the Scots.<br>
<br>
He married Catherine Grandison, daughter of William Grandison, 1st Baron Grandison. Legend holds that Edward III was in love with her, and that it was her dropped garter from which the Order of the Garter derives its name. The matter is disputed, but the garter at least is more likely to have belonged to Joan of Kent, who was engaged to her son. There is also a story that the king raped the countess, but this is probably a fruit of French propaganda.<br>
<br>
Montacute was succeeded by his eldest son, William Montacute, 2nd Earl of Salisbury. One of his daughters, Philippa, married Roger Mortimer, 2nd Earl of March.<br>

Rainier DE MONTFERRAT
<p>
<a name ="I015256"><b>[I015256]</b></a><br />
Rainier I of Montferrat (1084-c.1136) was marquess of Montferrat from around 1100 to around 1136. He was the son of marquess William II of Montferrat and his wife Otta d'Aglie, a daughter of Tibaldo dʼAglie.<br>
<br>
Rainier married Gisela, daughter of William I, Count of Burgundy. Gisela was the widow of Humbert II of Savoy, who had died in 1103, and by whom she was mother of Adelasia of Moriana (fr. Adélaide de Maurienne), who in 1115 became the second queen of Louis VI of France. She and Rainier had three or four daughters:<br>
    * Johanna, who married William Clito, Count of Flanders in 1127, and was widowed a year later.<br>
    * Matilda, who married Alberto 'Zueta', marquess of Parodi.<br>
    * Name unknown (possibly Isabella), who married Guido, Count of Biandrate (although it is possible that this may be a second marriage of Johanna).<br>
    * Adelasia, who became a nun.<br>
</p>
William III DE MONTFERRAT
<p>
<a name ="I015254"><b>[I015254]</b></a><br />
From Wikipedia<br>
<br>
William III of Montferrat (it. Guglielmo) (c. 1115-1191), also known as William the Old to distinguish him from his eldest son, William Longsword, was marquess of Montferrat from c. 1136 to his death in 1191. William was the only son of marquess Renier I and his wife Gisela, a daughter of William I, Count of Burgundy. It seems likely, given that he was still fit enough to participate in battle in 1187, that William was one of his parents' youngest children. He was described by Otto Morena as of medium height and compact build, with a round, somewhat ruddy face and hair so fair as to be almost white. He was talkative, intelligent and good-humoured, generous but not extravagant.<br>
<br>
He served honourably in the Second Crusade, alongside his nephew Louis VII of France. (Louis was only several years younger than William, but his mother Adelasia of Moriana was William's half-sister, through his mother Gisela's first marriage to Count Humbert of Savoy).<br>
<br>
William married Judith or Julitta von Babenberg, daughter of Leopold III of Austria, sometime before March 28, 1133. It is likely that Judith was still very young at the time: none of their children seem to have been born before 1140, and the youngest son in 1162. She died after 1168. They had five sons, four of whom became prominent in the affairs of the Kingdom of Jerusalem and of Byzantium:<br>
    * William Longsword, Count of Jaffa and Ascalon, father of Baldwin V of Jerusalem<br>
    * Conrad, King of Jerusalem<br>
    * Boniface, his successor to Montferrat and founder of the Kingdom of Thessalonica<br>
    * Frederick or Otto, who entered the Church, and may have been Bishop of Alba (although Usseglio notes there are difficulties in identifying him firmly)<br>
    * Renier, married into the Byzantine imperial family<br>
and three daughters:<br>
    * Adelasia or Azalais, who married Manfredo II, marquess of Saluzzo<br>
    * Agnes, who married Count Guido Guerra of Tuscany. The marriage was annulled before 1180, when Guido remarried, and Agnes seems to have entered a convent.<br>
    * An unidentified daughter, who married Alberto, marquess of Malaspina.<br>
<br>
As as traditional supporter of the Ghibellines, William and his sons fought with the Emperor Frederick Barbarossa in his struggle with the Lombard League. Following Barbarossa's capitulation with the Peace of Venice in 1177, William was left to deal with the rebellious towns in the area alone. Meanwhile, the Byzantine emperor Manuel I Comnenus sought support for his own politics in Italy. In 1179 he suggested a marriage between his daughter Maria, second in line to the throne, and a son of William the Old. As the youngest son, Renier was the only one then unmarried, he was married off to the princess, who was thirteen years his senior.<br>
<br>
In 1183, with the accession of his grandson Baldwin V, a minor, as co-King of Jerusalem, William, then probably in his late sixties, left the government of Montferrat to his third son, Boniface, and returned to the east. He was granted the castle of St. Elias (present-day El Taiyiba). He fought in the Battle of Hattin in 1187, where he was captured by Saladin's forces. In the meantime, his second son, Conrad, had arrived at Tyre from Constantinople. Conrad was given the command of the defences, and is said to have refused to surrender as much as a stone of its walls to liberate his father, even threatening to shoot him with a crossbow himself when Saladin had him presented as a hostage. Eventually, William was released unharmed, and Saladin withdrew his army from Tyre. He seems to have ended his days there, with his son.<br>
</p>
Bertrade DE MONTFORT
<p>
<a name ="I005005"><b>[I005005]</b></a><br />
Bertrade de Montfort (c.1070-1117) was the daughter of Simon I de Montfort and Agnes, Countess of Evreux. Her brother was Amaury III de Montfort.<br>
<br>
In 1089 she married Count Fulk IV of Anjou, and they became the parents of a son, but Bertrade left Fulk and took up with King Philippe. Philippe married her on May 15, 1092, despite the fact that they both had spouses living. He was so enamoured of Bertrade that he refused to leave her even when threatened with excommunication. Pope Urban II did excommunicate him in 1095, and Philip was prevented from taking part in the First Crusade. Astonishingly, Bertrade persuaded Philippe and Fulk to be friends.<br>
<br>
Bertrade and Philippe had four children together:<br>
   1. Philippe de France, Count of Mantes (c. 1093 [?]-1123)<br>
   2. Fleury de France, Lord of Nangis (1095 [?]-1118)<br>
   3. Cécile (1097-1145), married (1) Tancred, Prince of Galilee; married (2) Pons of Tripoli<br>
   4. Eustachie (c. 1095-?), married Jean, Count of Etampes<br>
<br>
According to Orderic Vitalis, Bertrade was anxious that one of her sons succeed Philippe, and sent a letter to King Henry I of England asking him to arrest her stepson Louis. Orderic also claims she sought to kill Louis first through the arts of sorcery, and then through poison. Whatever the truth of these allegations, Louis succeeded Philippe in 1108. Bertrade lived on until 1117; William of Malmesbury says: "Bertrade, still young and beautiful, took the veil at Fontevraud Abbey, always charming to men, pleasing to God, and like an angel.". Her son from her first marriage was Fulk V of Anjou who later became King of Jerusalem. The dynasties founded by Fulk's sons ruled for centuries, one of them England (Plantagenet), the other Jerusalem).<br>
</p>
Eleanor DE MONTFORT
<p>
<a name ="I010539"><b>[I010539]</b></a><br />
Eleanor de Montfort, Princess of Wales and Lady of Snowdon (1252 - 19 June 1282) was a daughter of Simon de Montfort, 6th Earl of Leicester and Eleanor of England. She was also the first woman who can be shown to have used the title Princess of Wales.<br>
<br>
Early life<br>
Eleanor's maternal grandparents were John of England and his queen consort Isabella of Angoulême. Her maternal uncles included Henry III of England and Richard, 1st Earl of Cornwall. Her maternal aunts included Joan of England, Queen of Scotland, and Isabella of England, and Joan, Lady of Wales.<br>
<br>
When Eleanor was thirteen years old, her father Earl Simon and brother Lord Henry were killed at the Battle of Evesham (4 August 1265). According to the chroniclers, Nicholas Trivet, William Rishanger and others, Earl Simon had earlier made an alliance with Llywelyn ap Gruffudd, whereby it was agreed that Llywelyn and Eleanor would marry. After Earl Simon's death, his family was forced to flee the Kingdom of England: Countess Eleanor took her daughter to the safety of the Dominican nunnery at Montargis, France, a Montfort foundation.<br>
<br>
Marriage to Llywelyn ap Gruffydd<br>
Countess Eleanor died in Spring 1275, and shortly afterwards Llywelyn ap Gruffudd, the Prince of Wales, and Eleanor de Montfort married by proxy, (per nuncios) per verba de presenti (Canon law endorsed a marital bond that was made in this way, with the full consent of both of the individuals, before witnesses).<br>
<br>
Capture and imprisonment by Edward I<br>
Eleanor began the sea voyage from France to north Wales, avoiding making a land passage through England. The two ships carrying Eleanor, her brother Amaury and their entourage, sailing off the south coast of England, were captured by sailors from the port of Bristol, just off the Isles of Scilly. Six named men together with the crews of four ships of Bristol were rewarded with a payment of 220 marks. 'Thomas Larchdeacon', 'Thomas the Archdeacon', who masterminded the capture on behalf of her first cousin Edward I of England was paid £20 in May 1276 by the king's orders, through the sheriff of Cornwall. (Calendar of Close Rolls, 1272-79, 292).<br>
<br>
Eleanor was taken by ship to Bristol, then held prisoner at Windsor for nearly three years. In 1278, following the signing of the Treaty of Aberconwy, she was released.<br>
<br>
Married life<br>
Eleanor and Llywelyn were formally married (secundum formam ecclesie) at the cathedral door, as was the custom, of the cathedral church at Worcester, on the Feast Day of St Edward, 1278; Edward gave the bride, his cousin, away and paid for the wedding feast. Before the wedding mass was celebrated, Edward insisted that Llywelyn should put his seal to an adjustment to the agreement that they had previously made. Llywelyn had no alternative but to comply, and he later stated that he did it under duress, 'moved by the fear that can grip a steadfast man' (see Registrum Epistolarum Fratis Johannis Peckham Archiepiscopi Cantuariensis, Lambeth Palace Archives).<br>
<br>
Following the ceremony, Eleanor became officially known as Princess of Wales and Lady of Snowdon. (see Calendar of Patent Rolls, 1272-81, 306; CPR, 1281-92, 11; Calendar of Ancient Correspondence, 75-76; Foedera I, ii, 576, 584, 587).<br>
<br>
Death and legacy<br>
Eleanor died in childbirth on 19 June 1282 (see The chronicle of Bury St Edmunds, 74-76) at the royal home Abergwyngregyn, on the north coast of Gwynedd; her body was carried across the Lafan Sands to the Franciscan Friary of Llanfaes, Anglesey. The Friary, on the opposite shore of the Menai to Abergwyngregyn, had been founded by Llywelyn Fawr, the grandfather of Llywelyn ap Gruffudd, in memory of his wife Joan.<br>
<br>
On 12 July 1282, members of Eleanor's personal household were given 'safe-conduct' to travel to England.<br>
<br>
Llywelyn was killed on 11 December 1282. The child, Gwenllian of Wales, was captured the following year by the armies of King Edward I of England, and taken to be held at Sempringham Priory in Lincolnshire.<br>

Hugh DE MONTFORT
<p>
<a name ="I008775"><b>[I008775]</b></a><br />
Hugh de Montfort, who, on account of his mother being so great an heiress, assumed the name of Montfort, inherited all the possessions of his grandfather and was called Hugh the fourth. This Hugh, having m.Adeline, dau. of Robert, Earl of Mellent, joined with Waleran, her brother, and all those who endeavoured to advance William, son of Rober tCurthose, against King Henry I in 1124, and entering Normandy for that purpose, he was made prisoner, with the said Waleran, and confined for the fourteen years ensuing. The time of his death is not ascertained buthe left issue, Robert; Thurstan; Adeline, m. to William de Britolio; Ada,m. to Richard, son of the Earl of Gloucester. He was s. by his elder son, Robert de Montfort.

</p>
Simon IV DE MONTFORT
<p>
<a name ="I010600"><b>[I010600]</b></a><br />
Killed in battle at EveshamThe first of this family that settled in England was Simon de Montfort, surnamed the Bald, great grandson of Almaric, an illegitimate son of Robert,* King of France. Which Simon having m. Amicia, one of the two sisters and co-heirs of Robert de Bellemont, or Beaumont, surnamed Fitz-Parnel, 4th and last Earl of Leicester of that family, obtained a grant of the Earldom of Leicester from King John, with a confirmation of the Stewardship of England, which he acquired by the possession of the honour of Hinkley, a portion of the immense fortune of his wife. But notwithstanding these marks of royal favour, the earl, within a brief period, revolted from the King of England to the King of France, for which act of treason the Earldom of Leicester was transferred to Ranulph, Earl of Chester, the honours of Hinkley seized upon by the crown, and de Montfort himself banished the realm. Soon after this (1209), we find him under the title of Earl of Montfort, general of the crusade against the Albigenses, and in nine years subsequently a leader in the besieging arms of Lewis, King of France, before the walls of Toulouse where he was slain by a slinger from the battlements. His lordship had two sons by the co-heiress of Beaumont, namely, Almaric and Simon.<br>

<br>
It was Simon's father (also Simon) who married Amicia de Bellemont as his 2nd wife and mother of this Simon.<br>
<br>
Simon de Montfort, b. 1165?--d. June 25, 1218, Toulouse, Fr., French leader of the Albigensian Crusade declared by Pope Innocent III against the Cathari, an unorthodox religious group in southern France.In 1190 Montfort married Alice de Montmorency (died 1221). During the Fourth Crusade (1202-04) he participated in the siege of Zara and later fought in Syria. Beginning in 1209 he led the fight against the Cathari (better known as Albigenses after the town of Albi) in a crusade that quickly became a war of conquest by the northern French against the nobility of the south. Having conquered Béziers and Carcassonne, he was chosen to govern those lands. When most of the crusaders departed after the 40-day term they had promised to serve, he was left with large territories still to conquer. After he had won the important Battle of Muret in 1213, the lands of Raymond VI, count of Toulouse, were adjudged to Montfort by the fourth Lateran Council (1215) because of Raymond's failure to root out heretics. He now styled himself count of Toulouse, viscount of Béziers and Carcassonne, and duke of Narbonne, but Raymond did not accept defeat. He occupied Toulouse in September 1217. Montfort was killed while besieging the city. His son Amaury (died 1241) soon abandoned the crusade and ceded the Montfort lands in southern France to King Louis VIII. [Encyclopædia Britannica CD '97]<br>
<br>
From Wikipedia<br>
<br>
Simon de Montfort, 5th Earl of Leicester, also Simon IV de Montfort (1160 - June 25, 1218) was a French nobleman who took part in the Fourth Crusade (1202 - 1204) and was a prominent leader of the Albigensian Crusade. He died at the siege of Toulouse in 1218.<br>
<br>
He was the son of Simon III de Montfort, descended from the lords of Montfort l'Amaury in France near Paris, and Amicia de Beaumont. He succeeded his father as Baron de Montfort in 1181; in 1190 he married Alix de Montmorency, the daughter of Bouchard III de Montmorency. In 1191 his brother, Guy, left on the Third Crusade in the retinue of King Philip II of France.<br>
<br>
In 1199, while taking part in a tournament at Ecry-sur-Aisne, he heard Fulk of Neuilly preaching the crusade, and in the company of Count Thibaud de Champagne, he took the cross. The crusade soon fell under Venetian control, and was diverted to Zara on the Adriatic Sea. Pope Innocent III had specifically warned the Crusaders not to attack fellow Christians; Simon tried to reassure the citizens of Zara that there would be no attack, but nevertheless, the city was sacked in 1202. Simon did not participate in this action, and soon he left the Crusade altogether. Afterwards, under Venetian guidance the Crusaders sacked the city of Constantinople-the main trading rival to Venice.<br>
<br>
His mother was the eldest daughter of Robert de Beaumont, 3rd Earl of Leicester. After the death of her brother Robert de Beaumont, 4th Earl of Leicester without children in 1204, she inherited half of his estates, and a claim to the Earldom of Leicester. The division of the estates was effected early in 1207, by which the rights to the earldom were assigned to Amicia and Simon. However, King John of England took possession of the lands himself in February 1207, and confiscated it's revenues. Later, in 1215, the lands were passed into the hands of Simon's nephew, Ranulph de Meschines, 4th Earl of Chester.<br>
<br>
Simon remained on his estates in France, where in 1208 he was made captain-general of the French forces in the Albigensian Crusade. Simon was given the territory conquered from Raymond VI of Toulouse. He became notorious and feared for his extreme cruelty, massacring whole towns, and for his "treachery, harshness, and bad faith." He was a man of extreme religious orthodoxy, deeply commited to the Dominican order and the suppression of heresy. In 1213 he defeated Peter of Aragon at the Battle of Muret. The Albigensians were now crushed, but Simon carried on the campaign as a war of conquest, being appointed lord over all the newly-acquired territory as Count of Toulouse and Duke of Narbonne (1215). He occupied himself in waging war at Nı̂mes, until in 1217 a rebellion broke out in Provence, where Count Raymond's son re-entered Toulouse. Simon hastened to besiege the city, and was killed on 25 June 1218 while fighting a sally by the besiegers. He was buried in the Monastery of Haute-Bruyère.<br>
<br>
Simon left three sons: his French estates passed to his eldest son, Amaury de Montfort, while his younger son, Simon, eventually gained possession of the earldom of Leicester and played a major role in the reign of Henry III of England. Another son, Guy, died at the seige of Castelnaudary in 1220. His daughter, Petronilla, became an abbess at the Cistercian nunnery of St. Antoine's. Another daughter, Amicia, founded the nunnery at Montargis and died there in 1252.<br>
</p>
Simon V DE MONTFORT
<p>
<a name ="I010598"><b>[I010598]</b></a><br />
Simon de Montfort is said to have first sought an asylum in England from the hostility of Blanche, Queen of France, and to have obtained a restitution of the Earldom of Leicester and stewardship of England from King Henry III through the petition of his brother, Almaric [Amaury], then Earl of Montfort and constable of France. Certain it is, however, that in 1232 (16th Henry III), he bore the title of Earl of Leicester and had obtained a grant of all his mother's inheritance in England from his brother. In 1236, his lordship officiated as steward at the nuptials of Henry III, and held the ewer in which the king washed. In two years afterwards, he obtained the hand of the king's sister, Eleanor, widow of William Marshal, Earl of Pembroke, the marriage ceremony being performed by Walter, one of the royal chaplains at Westminster, "within a little chappel at the corner of the king's chamber." This marriage was, however, opposed by the princess's other brother, Richard, Earl of Cornwall (afterwards King of the Romans), and the kingdom at large, because the lady had made in her widowhood a vow of chastity in the presence of Edmund, Archbishop of Canterbury and several of the nobility. So strongly did public discontent manifest itself that the earl was obliged to repair in person to Rome for the purpose of obtaining a dispensation, which with considerable difficulty he at length accomplished; and returning to England was most graciously received at court by the king, who appointed him his chief counsellor. Notwithstanding this, however, William de Abingdon, a Dominican friar, and many other of the clergy continued to exclaim against the marriage. But before the close of the same year, he experienced the caprice of royal favour. The king observing him and his countess amongst the nobility who attended the queen at her purification, called him an excommunicated person and prohibited his entering the church. "Which sudden unkindness," says Dugdale, "much dismaying him, he went away by water to Winchester House, which (the bishop being dead) the king had lent him. But there he could not be permitted to stay, the king in great wrath causing him to be put out of doors. Whereupon he returned sorrowing and weeping, yet could not appease his anger, the king plainly telling him that he had abused his sister before marriage, and that, though he afterward gave her to him for a wife, it was unwillingly, and to avoid scandal. Upbraiding him that to ratify this, his unlawful marriage, he went to Rome and there corrupted that court with large bribes and promises, adding that, having failed in payment of the money, he ought justly be excommunicated." This storm ultimately drove his lordship from the kingdom, but only for a short period, as we find him returning in 1240, and having then an honourable reception from the king and all his court. Soon after this he made a journey to Jerusalem, having previously disposed of one of his woods to the knights hospitallers and canons of Leicester for somewhat less than £1000 to defray part of the necessary expenses of the undertaking. Henceforward, he appears for a series of years to have enjoyed the high favour of the king and to have fully merited it by his eminent services.<br>

In the 32nd Henry III [1248], his lordship was appointed commander-in-chief of the forces in Gascony and in the end of that year he sat in the great convention of parliament held at London; about which time he obtained from the king a grant of the custody of Kenilworth Castle, for Eleanor, his wife, to hold during her life, and returning into Gascony, he forced Guaston de Bearne, who had raised the standard of rebellion, to an honourable truce. The earl came back to England the next year and was received at court with great honour. Soon after which, in fulfillment of a vow he had made as penance for his marriage, he began a journey to the Holy Land, and in the 34th of the same reign returned safely with his brother-in-law, Richard, Earl of Cornwall, and others. For the two following years he was actively and victoriously employed in Gascony until the king, hearkening to complaints against him for his cruelty and oppression, which appear to have been unsustainable, removed him from the seneschalship of that country.<br>
<br>
Upon the subsequent insurrection of the barons against the king, the Earl of Leicester, siding with the former, was appointed their general-in-chief, in which character he fought the great battle of Lewes where the royal army sustained so signal a defeat the king himself being made prisoner with Prince Edward, his son, his brother, Richard, King of the Romans, and many other personages of eminence attached to his cause. This victory placing the government in the hands of the earl and his adherents, himself, the bishop of Chichester, the Earl of Gloucester, and a few others of less note were nominated to discharge the executive functions. One of the earliest acts of the usurpation was to summon a parliament in the king's name by writs dated 24 December, 49th Henry III [1265], directed to the bishops and abbots and to such lay lords as could be relied upon by which, signifying "the realm to be then in peace and quiet, and the desire of the king to establish the same to the honour of God, and benefit of his people," they were summoned to meet at London on the octaves of St. Hilary, there to sit in parliament, "to treat and give their advice." At the same time, precepts were issued to the sheriffs ordering them to return two knights for each county; to the cities and boroughs the like number of citizens and burgesses; and to the barons of the Cinque Ports, a certain number of their discreetest men for the same purpose. This is deemed the first precedent of a parliament, such as ever since has been established, and Sir William Dugdale thus speculates upon the causes of the revolution -- "If I may be so bold as to give my opinion, what reasons these potent rebels then had, thus to alter the former ancient usage, I shall take leave to conjecture that it was because they, discerning what large retinues the nobility and other great men in those elder times had , as also a great number of the king's tenants in capite, then called barones minores, it might have proved dangerous to themselves to permit such a multitude to come together."<br>
The new government did not, however, endure long, for a breach taking place between the two chiefs, Leicester and Gloucester, the arms of those powerful persons were directed against each other, and Prince Edward effecting his escape about the same time, the Earl of Gloucester reared the royal standard and formed a junction with the forces of the prince. With this army, marching towards Kenilworth, they surprised young Simon Montfort, the earl's son, and made prisoners of no less than thirteen of his chief adherents, almost without resistance. Elated with this triumph, they proceeded to Evesham, where the Earl of Leicester and his great force lay, expecting the arrival of his son whose banners the royal arms as a stratagem of war alone displayed and thereby completely deceived this able commander. His lordship undismayed, however, drew out his army in order of battle and, fighting gallantly to the last, fell in the midst of his enemies, when victory declared for the royal cause. It is said that, when the earl discerned the superiority and disposition of the royalist forces, he swore "by the arm of St. James (his usual exclamation), they have done discreetly, but this they learned from me; let us therefore commend our souls to God because our bodies are theirs." Nevertheless, encouraging his men, he told them, "it was for the laws of the land, yea, the cause of God and justice, that they were to fight." The principal persons slain in the memorable engagement were the Earl himself, Henry de Montfort, his eldest son, Hugh le Despenser, then justice of England, Ralph Basset, of Drayton, and about one hundred and sixty knights and many other gentlemen of his party. Amongst the prisoners were Guy de Montfort, a younger son of the earl; John Fitz-John, Humphrey de Bohun, the younger; John de Vesci, Peter de Montfort, junr., and Nicholas de Segrave. The body of the Earl was removed from the field of battle by some of his friends upon an old ladder covered with a poor torn cloth, and thus conveyed to the abbey of Evesham where, folded in a sheet, it was committed to the grave. But within a short time, some of the monks alleging that the earl, being an excommunicated person and attainted of treason, his remains were unworthy of Christian burial, the body was taken up and interred in a remote place known but to few. Thus fell, in 1264, Simon de Montfort, Earl of Leicester; one of the most eminent soldiers and statesmen of the period in which he lived and, under his attainder, the earldom became extinct. Of his widow, Eleanor, the king's sister, it is stated that, after the fatal battle of Evesham, she fled into France and took up her abode in the nunnery of the order of preachers, at Montarges, which had been founded by her husband's sister.<br>
<br>
Of his issue:<br>
<br>
Henry fell at Evesham, leading the van of the baronial army.<br>
<br>
Simon, who for some time gallantly defended the castle of Kenilworth, was eventually made prisoner in the Isle of Ely by Prince Edward; afterwards effecting his escape, he fled into France and, in 1270, being at Viterbuirm, in Italy, he joined with his brother, Guy, in the murder of their cousin, Henry, eldest son of Richard, King of the Romans, in the church of St. Silvester, as the prince assisted at mass.<br>
<br>
Guy fought in the van of the baronial army at Evesham, and being made prisoner, was confined in Dover Castle from which escaping, he fled into Tuscany and there, acquiring high reputation as a soldier, he obtained the dau. and heiress of the Earl Rufus for his wife. Meeting with Prince Henry, son of the King of the Romans, Guy and his brother, Simon slew him in revenge in the church of St. Silvester, at Viterbuirm, for which barbarous at, being first excommunicated by Pope Gregory X, he was thrown into prison but released in 1282 by Pope Martin II, and placed at the head of an army, in which situation he displayed his characteristic prowess. He subsequently, at the decease of his wife's father, returned to Tuscany and inherited a very considerable fortune. Charles I, King of Naples, made him Count de Nola.

<br>
Simon de Montfort, Earl of Leicester (b. c. 1208, Montfort, Ile-de-France, Fr.--d. Aug. 4, 1265, Evesham, Worcestershire, Eng.), leader of the baronial revolt against King Henry III and ruler of England for less than a year.<br>
<br>
Simon de Montfort, wholly French by birth and education, was the son of Simon de Montfort l'Amaury, leader of the crusade against the heretical Albigenses. On coming of age, he renounced to his eldest brother, Amaury, his claims on the family lands in return for the sole right to revive the Montfort claim to the English earldom of Leicester. This claim derived from his mother, Amicia, sister of Robert IV (died 1204), the last Beaumont earl of Leicester, whose lands had been divided between Amicia and her younger sister Margaret, countess of Winchester. King John had recognized Simon's father as earl (c. 1205) but had deprived him as a French subject (1207), and the Montfort claim had then lapsed.<br>
<br>
Simon came to England in 1229 and, helped by his cousin Ranulf, earl of Chester, the tenant of the confiscated estates, obtained the honour of Leicester and did homage to Henry III in 1231, though he was not formally styled earl of Leicester until April 1239. He speedily became one of Henry's favourites, receiving an annual fee of 500 marks to compensate for the divided inheritance and exercising the hereditary stewardship at the coronation of Queen Eleanor (Eleanor of Provence; 1236). Henry arranged for his sister Eleanor to marry Simon on Jan. 7, 1238, thus breaking Eleanor's earlier vow of chastity and offending the English noblemen, who were not consulted. Henry's brother, Richard, earl of Cornwall, led an angry baronial protest, and Henry, alarmed, turned against Simon and Eleanor, driving them from England (August 1239). Simon went on crusade (1240-42) with Richard, with whom he was now reconciled, and won great prestige among the lords of the Latin Kingdom of Jerusalem, who asked their absentee king, the emperor Frederick II, to appoint Simon as his viceroy there. Returning to England, Simon joined Henry's disastrous invasion of France (1242), winning distinction by covering Henry's escape after his defeat at Saintes. Reconciled with Henry, and accepting an unfavourable settlement of Countess Eleanor's dower claims, Simon now made Kenilworth Castle (a royal grant) his headquarters. He cultivated the friendship of the radical reformer Robert Grosseteste, bishop of Lincoln, and took Robert's friend, the Oxford Franciscan Adam de Marisco, as spiritual director. Although regarded as a king's man, Simon was one of the committee of 12 appointed to handle the acute crisis of 1244 between Henry and his angry barons. He also took part in many important embassies to the French, papal, and imperial courts, and as a result he won many influential friends.<br>
<br>
In 1248 Henry asked Simon to pacify the English-held Duchy of Gascony, in southwestern France. Simon, eager to join Louis IX's crusade, accepted reluctantly, stipulating for full powers as regent for seven years, without fear of recall and with full refund of expenses incurred. Treating the Gascon nobles as faithless rebels outside the law, he ruthlessly crushed the revolt and restored order; the Gascons appealed to Henry, accusing Simon of illegal procedure and oppression and threatening to renew their revolt. The matter was complicated by Simon's personal contest with Gaston de Béarn, the leading rebel. Henry, frightened, recalled Simon for trial on the rebels' charges; the English magnates acquitted him (1252), and he returned to Gascony to suppress the renewed revolt, but Henry now terminated his lieutenancy. Simon, accepting a partial financial settlement, withdrew to France, though Henry had to implore his help in his own campaign against the rebels in 1253. Such was Simon's international reputation that when Louis IX's mother, Blanche of Castile, died (November 1252) while Louis was still on crusade, the French magnates invited Simon to succeed her as regent.<br>
<br>
Henry's behaviour over Gascony, though not wholly unjustified, convinced Simon that Henry was unfit to rule, and the King's disastrous undertaking, at Pope Innocent IV's behest, to conquer Sicily for his son Edmund, strengthened this conviction. Discussions with Grosseteste, Marisco, and other Franciscan intellectuals had fired Simon's mind with visions of a new order in both church and state, and he joined the other leading English barons in forcing upon Henry the revolutionary Provisions of Oxford (June 1258). The reformers began well, but by October 1259 divisions appeared between the conservative wing, led by Richard de Clare, earl of Gloucester, that sought only to limit abuses of royal power, and the radical element, led by Simon, that sought to bind the entire baronage to observe the reforms forced upon the King and his officers. Simon exacerbated the quarrel by his arrogant vehemence and put himself in the wrong by attempting to use Henry's subordination to secure settlement of his own and his wife's justifiable personal claims on Henry. Henry, allying with the Gloucester faction, shattered baronial unity early in 1260, and Simon emerged leading the extremist defenders of the reforms. By October 1261 Henry had isolated Simon, who went abroad; but the King's annulment of the Provisions, after he had received papal absolution from his oath to observe them, revived general disaffection (1262), and Simon returned (April 1263) to lead a rebellion that restored the Provisions (July 1263). But baronial unity had vanished, and, despite passionate support from the lesser barons, the county knights, the men of London and the Cinque Ports, and many clergy, Simon was forced to accept arbitration by Louis IX (December 1263). By the Mise of Amiens (January 1264) Louis totally annulled the Provisions and all consequent reforms: Simon rejected the award and after unsuccessfully attempting direct negotiations, defeated Henry at Lewes (May 14, 1264), capturing Henry and his son, the lord Edward.<br>
<br>
Simon then governed England by military dictatorship, striving unsuccessfully for a legal basis of consent, both by negotiations with Henry's supporters and by calling representatives of both shires and boroughs to Parliament (1265) to counterbalance his lack of baronial support. But his monopolization of power alienated his chief ally, the young Gilbert de Clare, earl of Gloucester, who joined the royalist Marcher lords and secured Lord Edward's escape at Hereford (May 1265). By rapid and skillful maneuvering, Edward isolated Simon behind the Severn, destroyed at Kenilworth (August 1) the large army coming to his rescue, and trapped Simon's little force at Evesham (Aug. 4, 1265), slaying Simon and most of his followers.<br>
<br>
The most outstanding English personality of his day, Simon is remembered as an early advocate of a limited monarchy, ruling through elected councillors and responsible officials, and of parliaments including county knights and burgesses as well as the great nobles.

<br>
Simon de Montfort, 6th Earl of Leicester (1208 - August 4, 1265) was the principal leader of the baronial opposition to king Henry III of England.<br>
<br>
He was the youngest son of Simon de Montfort, a French nobleman, and Alix of Montmorency. His paternal grandmother was Amicia de Beaumont, the senior co-heiress to the Earldom of Leicester and a large estate in England, but King John of England did not allow anyone who already held property in France to take ownership of such an estate in England.<br>
<br>
As a boy, Simon accompanied his parents during his father's campaigns against the Cathars. He was with his mother at the siege of Toulouse in 1218, where his father was killed after being struck on the head by a stone pitched by a mangonel. On the death of their father, Simon's elder brother Amaury succeeded him. Another brother, Guy, was killed at the siege of Castelnaudary in 1220. As a young man, Simon probably took part in the Albigensian Crusades of the early 1220s.<br>
<br>
In 1229 the two surviving brothers (Amaury and Simon) came to an arrangement whereby Simon gave up his rights in France and Amaury in turn gave up his rights in England. Thus freed from any allegiance to the king of France, Simon successfully petitioned for the English inheritance, which he received the next year, although he did not take full possession for several more years, and was not yet formally recognized as earl.<br>
<br>
Meanwhile in January 1238 he secretly married Eleanor of England, daughter of King John of England and Isabella of Angouleme, sister of King Henry III of England. Eleanor had previously been married to William Marshal, 2nd Earl of Pembroke, and she had sworn a vow of chastity on his death, which she broke by marrying Simon. The archbishop of Canterbury, Edmund Rich, condemned the marriage for this reason. The English nobles protested the marriage of the king's sister to a foreigner of modest rank; most notably, Eleanor's brother Richard rose up in revolt when he learned of the marriage. King Henry eventually bought off Richard with 6,000 marks and peace was restored.<br>
<br>
Relations between King Henry and Simon were cordial at first. Henry lent him his support when Simon embarked for Rome in March 1238 to seek papal approval for his marriage. When Simon and Eleanor's first son was born in November 1238 (despite rumors, more than nine months after the wedding night), he was baptized Henry in honor of his royal uncle. In February 1239 Simon was finally invested with the earldom of Leicester. He also acted as the king's counselor and was one of the godfathers of Henry's son, Edward.<br>
<br>
Shortly after Prince Edward's birth, however, there was a falling out. Simon owed a great sum of money to Thomas II of Savoy, the uncle of Henry's queen, and named Henry as security for his repayment. King Henry had evidently not been told of this, and when he discovered that Simon had used his name, he was enraged. On August 9, 1239 Henry confronted Simon, called him an excommunicate and threatened to imprison him in the Tower of London. "You seduced my sister," King Henry said, "and when I discovered this, I gave her to you, against my will, to avoid scandal." Simon and Eleanor fled to France to escape the king's wrath. Having announced his intention to go on Crusade two years previously, Simon raised funds and finally set out for the Holy Land in summer 1240, leaving Eleanor in Brindisi, Italy. His force followed behind the much larger army led by his brother, Amaury. Also at the same time Simon's brother-in-law Richard took the cross, but their armies traveled separately. He arrived in Jerusalem by June 1241, when the citizens asked him to be their governor, but does not seem to have ever faced combat in the Holy Land. That autumn he left Syria and joined King Henry's campaign in Poitou. The campaign was a failure, and an exasperated Simon declared that Henry ought to be locked up like Charles the Simple.<br>
<br>
Like his father, Simon was a hardened and ruthless soldier, as well as a capable administrator. His dispute with the king largely came about due to the latter's determination to ignore the swelling discontent within the country, caused by a combination of factors which included famine and a sense among the English barons that the king was too ready to dispense favour to his Poitevin and Savoyard relatives. In 1258, at Oxford, in his moment of greatest fame, Simon played a key role in calling a parliament which ranks as the forerunner of the modern institution. The king's son, the future King Edward I of England at first sympathised with Simon's cause, but later the two became enemies, and the Provisions of Oxford, which the king had sworn to uphold, were broken at the behest of the Pope in 1261.<br>
<br>
Civil war broke out, and Simon de Montfort's army met and defeated the royal forces at the Battle of Lewes on May 14, 1264. The rebels captured Prince Edward, and the subsequent treaty set up a model parliament to agree a constitution formulated by Simon, the first parliament at which both knights and burgesses were present, thereby substantially broadening representation to include new groups of society.<br>
<br>
However, many of the barons who had initially supported him now started to feel that Montfort's reforms were going too far, and his many enemies turned his triumph into disaster. Prince Edward escaped, and Simon's ally, Thomas de Clare, abandoned him and took with him his garrison. Though boosted by Welsh infantry sent by Simon's ally Llywelyn the Last, Simon's forces were severely depleted. Prince Edward attacked the Montfort forces at Kenilworth, capturing more of Simon's allies. Simon himself had crossed the Severn with his army, intending to rendezvous with his son Simon the younger de Montfort. When he saw the army awaiting him at Evesham, Simon initially thought it was led by his son. But the army belonged to Prince Edward, flying the Montfort banners he had captured at Kenilworth, and so leading Simon into a trap.<br>
<br>
Matthew Paris reports that the bishop of Lincoln, Robert Grosseteste, once said to Simon's eldest son, "My beloved child, both you and your father will meet your deaths on one day, and by one kind of death, but it will be in the name of justice and truth." When Simon de Montfort faced the army of his nephew Edward, and saw the skill with which it was organized, he declared, "By St. James' arm, they are approaching with wisdom, and they learned this method from me, not from themselves. Let us then commend our souls to God, for our bodie are theirs."<br>
<br>
Edward Longshanks' forces defeated and killed Montfort during the Barons' War at the Battle of Evesham in 1265, his body being mutilated, eviscerated and the remains scattered. His head was awarded to Roger Mortimer, who took it home as a gift for his wife. The precedent he set in calling his parliament with broader representation lived on, however, and was one that Edward would come to follow himself as king.<br>
<br>
Montfort's family were forced into exile in his native France. His daughter, Eleanor, later married Llywelyn the Last as Simon had planned. After his death Simon's lands and titles became forfeit to the crown. A few months later the crown re-granted them to Edmund Crouchback, the king's youngest son.<br>
<br>
Montfort has given his name to various English institutions, such as De Montfort University and De Montfort Hall, both in Leicester.<br>
<br>
A memorial to Simon de Montfort stands in the park in Evesham in a place believed to be near where the High Altar of Evesham Abbey was located and a Stone Cross in the nearby Churchyard, the Stone Cross being viewable from the park. The memorial states that it is constructed with stone brought from near his birthplace in France.<br>

Arnulf DE MONTGOMERY
<p>
<a name ="I008672"><b>[I008672]</b></a><br />
From Wikipedia<br>
<br>
Arnulf of Montgomery (c. 1068 - 1118/22) was an Anglo-Norman aristocrat, who played a role in the history of England, Wales, and Ireland.<br>
<br>
He was the youngest son of Roger of Montgomery, 1st Earl of Shrewsbury and Mabel of Bellême.<br>
<br>
Around 1090 he along with his elder brother Robert built a castle at Pembroke in Wales. In 1093 king William II of England rewarded his efforts with the formal lordship of Pembroke; some historians say that he was in fact created Earl of Pembroke. In any case the lordship was smaller than the later Pembrokeshire.<br>
<br>
His holdings were greatly expanded in 1096 when Rufus gave him the lordship of Holderness, which in addition to that part of Yorkshire included land in Lincolnshire.<br>
<br>
It is likely that Arnulf had been designated heir of his brother Hugh of Montgomery, 2nd Earl of Shrewsbury, but after Hugh's death in 1098 Arnulf was outmaneuvered by the eldest brother Robert, who became the 3rd earl of Shrewsbury. This caused some rift between the brothers but nevertheless Hugh participated in their rebellion of 1102 against Henry I of England which caused the loss of all their English and Welsh lands, and their banishment from the kingdom of England.<br>
<br>
Arnulf turned his attention to Ireland, where not long before he had married Lafrocoth, daughter of the Irish king Muircheartach Ua Briain in about the year 1100, and certainly before 1102, when he is mentioned by Muirchertach as his son-in-law in a letter to the Archbishop of Canterbury Anselm of Bec . Muirchertach provided support for Arnulf's rebellion, and as a result King Henry I of England placed a trade embargo on Ireland. It is suggested by Orderic Vitalis that Arnulf went to Ireland after the rebellion failed and served for Muirchertach Ua Briain, although the Irish Annals make no mention of this.<br>
<br>
In later years he was in the entourage of count Fulk V of Anjou.<br>
</p>
Robert II DE MONTGOMERY
<p>
<a name ="I005038"><b>[I005038]</b></a><br />
Robert of Bellême, 3rd Earl of Shrewsbury (1052- after 1130) was an Anglo-Norman nobleman, and one of the most promiment figures in the competition for the succession to England and Normandy between the sons of William the Conqueror.<br>
<br>
He was the eldest son of Roger of Montgomery, 1st Earl of Shrewsbury and Mabel of Bellême.<br>
<br>
Robert's first notable act, as a young man, was to take part in the 1077 revolt of the young Robert Curthose against William the Conqueror, an act he shared with many other Norman nobles of his generation. The rebellion was put down, and the participants pardoned. William did require that ducal garrisons be placed in the important baronial castles, which would make future rebellion much more difficult.<br>
<br>
Robert's mother Mabel was killed in 1082, whereupon Robert inherited her property which stretched across the hilly border region between Normandy and Maine. It is due to this early inheritance that Robert has come be known as of Bellême rather than of Montgomery.<br>
<br>
William the Conqueror died in 1087, and Robert's first act on hearing the news was to expel the ducal garrisons from his castles. Robert Curthose was the new duke of Normandy, but he was unable to keep order, and Robert of Bellême had a free hand to make war against his less powerful neighbors.<br>
<br>
The next year in the Rebellion of 1088, Odo of Bayeux rebelled in an attempt to place Curthose on the English throne in place of William Rufus. At Curthose's request Robert went to England, where he joined in the rebels' defense of Rochester Castle. The rebels were permitted to leave after the surrender of the castle and failure of the rebellion.<br>
<br>
Robert returned to Normandy. But Odo had preceded him, had gotten the ear of the duke, and conviced Curthose that Robert was a danger to the security of the duchy. Thus Robert was arrested and imprisoned upon his disembarkation. (The duke's younger brother Henry, who was on the same ship, was also arrested.)<br>
<br>
Robert's father earl Roger came over from England, and, taking over his son's castles, defied Curthose. The duke captured several of the castles, but he soon tired of the matter and released Robert.<br>
<br>
Once released, Robert returned to his wars and depredations against his neighbors in southern Normandy. He did help Curthose in putting down a revolt by the citizens of Rouen, but his motive seems to have been in large part to seize as many wealthy townspeople and their goods as possible. Curthose in turn subsequently helped Robert is some of his fights againsts his neighbors.<br>
<br>
In 1094 one of Robert's most important castles, Domfront, was taken over by the duke's brother Henry, who never relinquished it and was to be an enemy of Robert for the rest of his life.<br>
<br>
Later that year (1094) Robert's father earl Roger died. Robert's younger brother Hugh of Montgomery, 2nd Earl of Shrewsbury inherited the English lands and titles, while Robert inherited his father's Norman properties, which included good part of central and southern Normandy, in part adjacent to the Bellême territories he had already inherited from his mother.<br>
<br>
In 1098 Robert's younger brother Hugh died, and Robert inherited the English properties that had been their father's, including the Rape of Arundel and the Earldom of Shrewsbury.<br>
<br>
Robert was one of the great magnates who joined Robert Curthose's 1101 invasion of England, along with his brothers Roger the Poitevin and Arnulf of Montgomery and his nephew William of Mortain. This invasion, which aimed to depose Henry I, ended in the Treaty of Alton. The treaty called for amnesty for the participants but allowed traitors to be punished. Henry had a series of charges drawn up against Robert in 1102, and when Robert refused to answer for them, gathered his forces and besieged and captured Robert's English castles. Robert lost his English lands and titles (as did his brothers), was banished from England, and returned to Normandy.<br>
<br>
He was one of Curthose's commanders at the Battle of Tinchebrai and by flight from the field avoided being captured as Curthose was. With Normandy now under Henry's rule, he submitted and was allowed to retain his Norman fiefs. But after various conspiracies and plans to free Curthose Robert was seized and imprisoned in 1112. He spent the rest of his life in prison; the exact date of his death is not known.<br>
<br>
Robert married Agnes of Ponthieu, by whom he had one child, William Talvas, who via his mother inherited the county of Ponthieu.<br>
<br>
Robert had a quick wit, was a good military leader and was perhaps the best castle designer of his generation, but had a terrible reputation as a cruel sadist.<br>
</p>
Roger DE MONTGOMERY
<p>
<a name ="I005331"><b>[I005331]</b></a><br />
From Wikipedia<br>
<br>
Roger de Montgomerie, 1st Earl of Shrewsbury was known as Robert "the Great" of Montgomery (English). Son of another Roger de Montgomerie, who was a relative, probably a grandnephew, of duchess Gunnor, wife of duke Robert I of Normandy. The elder Roger had large holdings in central Normandy, chiefly in the valley of the Dives, which the younger Roger inherited.<br>
<br>
Roger was one of William the Conqueror's principal counselors. He did not fight in the initial invasion of England in 1066, instead staying behind to help govern Normandy. Afterwards he was entrusted with land in two places critical for the defense of England, receiving the Rape of Arundel at the end of 1067 (or in early 1068), and in November 1071 he was created Earl of Shrewsbury. (A few historians believe that while he received the Shropshire territories in 1071 he was not created earl until a few years later.)<br>
<br>
Roger was thus one of the half a dozen greatest magnates in England during William the Conqueror's reign. In addition to the large part of Sussex included in the Rape of Arundel, and seven-eights of Shropshire which were associated with the earldom of Shrewsbury, he had estates in Surrey, Hampshire, Wiltshire, Middlesex, Hertfordshire, Gloucestershire, Worcestershire, Cambridgeshire, Warwickshire and Staffordshire.<br>
<br>
After Williams's death in 1087, Roger had joined with other rebels to overthrow the newly crowned king William Rufus in the Rebellion of 1088. However William was able to convince Roger to abandon the rebellion and side with the king, which was fortuitious as the rebels were beaten and lost their land holdings in England. Roger first married Mabel of Bêlleme, who was heiress to a large territory on both sides of the border between Normandy and Maine. By her he had 10 children:<br>

Known as Robert "the Great" of Montgomery (English). Son of another Roger de Montgomerie, who was a relative, probably a grandnephew, of duchess Gunnor, wife of duke Robert I of Normandy. The elder Roger had large holdings in central Normandy, chiefly in the valley of the Dives, which the younger Roger inherited.<br>
<br>
Roger was one of William the Conqueror's principal counselors. He did not fight in the initial invasion of England in 1066, instead staying behind to help govern Normandy. Afterwards he was entrusted with land in two places critical for the defense of England, receiving the Rape of Arundel at the end of 1067 (or in early 1068), and in November 1071 he was created Earl of Shrewsbury. (A few historians believe that while he received the Shropshire territories in 1071 he was not created earl until a few years later.)<br>
<br>
Roger was thus one of the half a dozen greatest magnates in England during William the Conqueror's reign. In addition to the large part of Sussex included in the Rape of Arundel, and seven-eights of Shropshire which were associated with the earldom of Shrewsbury, he had estates in Surrey, Hampshire, Wiltshire, Middlesex, Hertfordshire, Gloucestershire, Worcestershire, Cambridgeshire, Warwickshire and Staffordshire.<br>
<br>
After Williams's death in 1087, Roger had joined with other rebels to overthrow the newly crowned king William Rufus in the Rebellion of 1088. However William was able to convince Roger to abandon the rebellion and side with the king, which was fortuitious as the rebels were beaten and lost their land holdings in England. Roger first married Mabel of Bêlleme, who was heiress to a large territory on both sides of the border between Normandy and Maine. By her he had 10 children:<br>

Robert DE MORTAGNE
<p>
<a name ="I005328"><b>[I005328]</b></a><br />
From Wikipedia<br>
<br>
Robert, Count of Mortain (d. 1095) was a half-brother of William the Conqueror, and became a great landholder in both England and Normandy.<br>
<br>
He was the son of William the Conqueror's mother Herleva, and Herluin, viscount of Conteville. Odo, Bishop of Bayeux was his older full brother. He was probably born around 1040, but perhaps a few years earlier.<br>
<br>
Around 1055 Duke William was consolidating his hold on the duchy, and having disposessed the count of Mortain, gave the county to Robert. Mortain was a frontier territory, bordering on Brittany and Maine, and Robert contributed to the defense of the duchy by constructing castles at the town of Mortain, and at St. Hilaire-du-Harcouet, le Tilleul, and Tinchebrai.<br>
<br>
During the next decade Robert was a close counselor of his half-brother, appearing frequently at his court, including the councils at which the invasion of England was planned. He surely fought at the Battle of Hastings itself, though he chronicles of the time are not specific, and more importantly he contributed a significant part of the invasion fleet.<br>
<br>
After the conquest, Robert obtained a large holding in England, including the strategic Rape of Pevensey in Sussex, and other lands guarding London, including Berkhamsted, Lambeth and Bermondsey. In 1072 he was entrusted with Cornwall after the previous ruler returned home to Brittany, though probably he never formally became earl. Nevertheless he was the second greatest lay magnate in England.<br>
<br>
Robert seems to have been uninterested in English politics -- some say he lacked the cleverness for it -- and he spent most of the remainder of the Conqueror's reign in Normandy. He stayed loyal to William to the end, even when his brother Odo of Bayeux rebelled and was imprisoned. At the dying duke's bedside he successfully argued for Odo's release.<br>
<br>
Odo seems to have pushed him into action, for Robert took part in the Rebellion of 1088 which attempted to replace William Rufus with Robert Curthose. After Pevensey surrendered and the rebellion failed, Rufus pardoned Robert, while Odo was exiled to Normandy. Their differing treatment may reflect contemporary assessment of Robert's lack of initiative.<br>
<br>
He married Matilda, daughter of Roger of Montgomery, 1st Earl of Shrewsbury, and was succeeded by their son William, Count of Mortain.<br>

Edmund DE MORTIMER
<p>
<a name ="I008465"><b>[I008465]</b></a><br />
Edmund Mortimer, 3rd Earl of March and jure uxoris Earl of Ulster (1351?27 December 1381) was son of Roger Mortimer, 2nd Earl of March, by his wife Philippa, daughter of William Montacute, 1st Earl of Salisbury.<br>
<br>
Early Life<br>
Being an infant at the death of his father, Edmund, as a ward of the crown, was placed by Edward III of England under the care of William of Wykeham and Richard Fitzalan, 10th Earl of Arundel.<br>
<br>
The position of the young earl, powerful on account of his possessions and hereditary influence in the Welsh marches, was rendered still more important by his marriage in 1368 at the age of 17 to the 13 year old Philippa, the only child of Lionel of Antwerp, Duke of Clarence, third son of Edward III.<br>
<br>
Lionel's wife, Elizabeth, was daughter and heiress of William de Burgh, 6th Lord of Connaught and 3rd Earl of Ulster, and Lionel had himself been created Earl of Ulster before his marriage. Edmund inherited the title Earl of Ulster on Lionel's death.<br>
<br>
Therefore, the Earl of March not only represented one of the chief Anglo-Norman lordships in Ireland in right of his wife Philippa, but Philippa's line was also the second most senior line of descent in the succession to the crown, after Edward, the Black Prince and his son, King Richard II of England.<br>
<br>
This marriage had, therefore, far-reaching consequences in English history, ultimately giving rise to the claim of the House of York to the crown of England contested in the Wars of the Roses; Edward IV being descended from the third son of Edward III as great-great-grandson of Philippa, countess of March, and in the male line from Edmund of Langley, fifth son of Edward III.<br>
<br>
Edmund's son Roger Mortimer, 4th Earl of March would become heir presumptive to the English crown during the reign of Richard II.<br>
<br>
Political Advancement<br>
Mortimer, now styled Earl of March and Ulster, became Marshal of England in 1369, and was employed in various diplomatic missions during the next following years. He was a member of the committee appointed by the Peers to confer with the Commons in 1373?the first instance of such a joint conference since the institution of representative parliaments on the question of granting supplies for John of Gaunt's war in France.<br>
<br>
He participated in the opposition to Edward III and the court party, which grew in strength towards the end of the reign, taking the popular side and being prominent in the Good Parliament of 1376 among the lords who supported the Prince of Wales and opposed the Court Party and John of Gaunt. The Speaker of the Commons in this parliament was March's steward, Peter de la Mare, who firmly withstood John of Gaunt in stating the grievances of the Commons, in supporting the impeachment of several high court officials, and in procuring the banishment of the king's mistress, Alice Perrers. March was a member of the administrative council appointed by the same parliament after the death of Edward, the Black Prince to attend the king and advise him in all public affairs.<br>
<br>
Reign of Richard II<br>
On the accession of Richard II, a minor, in 1377, the Earl became a member of the standing council of government; though as father of the heir-presumptive to the crown he wisely abstained from claiming any actually administrative office. The most powerful person in the realm was, however, John of Gaunt, Duke of Lancaster, whose jealousy of March led to the acceptance by the latter of the Lieutenancy of Ireland in 1379. March succeeded in asserting his authority in eastern Ulster, but failed to subdue the O?Neills farther west. Proceeding to Munster to put down the turbulency of the chieftains of the south, March died at Cork on 27 December 1381, (According Allison Wier in her book Wars of the Roses, Edmund took his job of Lord Lieutenant of Ireland seriously and was trying to restore order when he was ambushed and killed). He was buried in Wigmore Abbey, of which he had been a benefactor, and where his wife Philippa was also interred.<br>
<br>
The earl had three sons and two daughters, the elder of whom, Elizabeth, married Henry Percy "Hotspur", son of the Earl of Northumberland. His eldest son, Roger, succeeded him as 4th Earl of March and Ulster. His second son, Edmund played an important part, in conjunction with his brother-in-law Hotspur, in the fortunes of Owain Glyndwr. The other daughter was Philippa, who married Richard Fitzalan, 11th Earl of Arundel.<br>

Edmund DE MORTIMER
<p>
<a name ="I004598"><b>[I004598]</b></a><br />
Edmund Mortimer, 2nd Baron Wigmore (1251-July 17, 1304) was the second son and eventual heir of Roger Mortimer, 1st Baron Wigmore. As a younger son, Edmund had been intended for clerical or monastic life, and had been sent to study at Oxford University. He was made Treasurer of York in 1265. But the sudden death of his elder brother, Ralph, in 1276, made him heir to the family estates.<br>
<br>
He returned in 1282 as the new Baron Mortimer of Wigmore and immediately became involved in Marcher politics. Together with his brother Roger Mortimer of Chirk, John Giffard, and Roger Lestrange, he devised a plan to trap Llywelyn the Last. Edmund sent a message to Llywelyn telling him he was coming to Llywelyn's aid and arranged to meet with him at Builth. But Edmund's brothers secretly forded the river behind Llywelyn's army and surprised the Welsh. In the resulting battle Llywelyn was killed and beheaded. Edmund then send his brother Roger Mortimer of Chirk to present Llywelyn's severed head to King Edward I of England.<br>
<br>
In September 1285 he married Margaret de Fiennes, the daughter of William II de Fiennes and Blanche de Brienne (herself the granddaughter of John of Brienne). Their children were:<br>
   1. Roger Mortimer, 1st Earl of March<br>
   2. Maude Mortimer, married Theobald II de Verdun<br>
   3. John, yeoman, died 1318<br>
   4. Joan, nun at Lingbrook<br>
   5. Elizabeth, nun at Lingbrook<br>
<br>
Edmund was knighted by King Edward at Winchester, and served in the king's Gascon and Scottish campaigns. He was mortally wounded in a skirmish near Builth, and died at Wigmore Castle.<br>

Hugh DE MORTIMER
<p>
<a name ="I016290"><b>[I016290]</b></a><br />
HUGH DE MORTIMER, son and heir. Hugh de Mortimer attested a charter by Gerold, Abbot of St. Lucien at Beauvais [1100-28], in the time of Stephen, Count of Aumale. When King Stephen, circa I140, granted to the Earl of Leicester the town and castle of Hereford et lotum comitatum Herefordisc., the fees of Hugh de Mortimer were with others excepted. In 1144 he initiated the reconquest of the Marches after the revolt of the Welsh on the death of Henry I, by successfully reoccupying the cantreds of Maelienydd and Elfael, and repairing the castles of Cwmaron and Colwen. In 1145 he captured and imprisoned the Welsh prince Rhys ap Howel, and in 1146 he slew Meredith, son of Madog ap Idnerth, late chieftain of Elfael and Maelienydd. In 1148 be blinded his prisoner Rhys ap Howel. The name of his wife is unknown. He seems to have died in the period 1148-50. [Complete Peerage IX:268-9]<br>

Ralph DE MORTIMER
<p>
<a name ="I016293"><b>[I016293]</b></a><br />
Ralph DE MORTIMER served in the military in 1066 in Hastings, Sussex, England. Ralph de Mortimer, accompanying the Duke of Normandy in his expedition against England, was one of his principal commanders at the decisive battle of Hastings; and shortly after, as the most puissant of the victor's captains, was sent into the marches of Wales to encounter Edric, Earl of Shrewsbury, who still resisted the Norman yoke. This nobleman, after much difficulty, and a long siege in his castle of Wigmore, Mortimer subdued, and delivered into the king's hands. When, as a reward for his good service, he obtained a grant of all Edric's estates, and seated himself thenceforward at Wigmore. Independently of these great Welsh territorial possessions, Ralph Mortimer enjoyed by the bounty of his royal master sundry lordships and manors in other parts of the realm, which he held at the time of the General Survey. In the beginning of Rufus's reign, Mortimer took part with Curthose, but he subsequently changed sides, and being constituted general of the forces sent to oppose that prince in Normandy, by King Henry I., he totally routed the enemy, and brought Curthose prisoner to the king. He died about 1104. The Mortimers were an Anglo-Norman family that settled on the Welsh marches (the frontier area along the English border) in the 11th century and later became one of the richest and most powerful families in the kingdom of England.<br>
