Gerald R. THOMAS
<p>
<a name ="I077282"><b>[I077282]</b></a><br />
ONTARIO -This story is to mark the passing of Gerald R. Thomas of Baker City, OR. A student of history, both Oregon and American, his stories both entertained and informed. Gerald's special interest was the history of Sumpter and Baker City, the gold boom of the 1860s and 70s and later the people who built these communities leaving their landmarks. His favorite teller of tales was Mark Twain and Gerald's own stories of the adventures with his friends and peers in Sumpter and Baker had a similar slant. A listener would either end up laughing or startled at the craziness.<br>
Gerald was born in 1934 at the Waverly Baby Home in Portland, OR. He was only a few days old when he was adopted by Richard Warren and Elsie McLean Thomas of Baker City. Some of his adopted family loved him unconditionally. Gerald said the sun rose and set in the pockets of his uncle Charlie Langrell who owned the second-hand store on Broadway in Baker City across from the Jr. High. Gerald researched the history of his adoptive family, combing library archives for the stories.<br>
For years Gerald searched for information about his birth parents. Oregon adoption records were sealed and of little assistance. When Gerald was 70 years old, a shot in the dark in Tucson, AZ, led him to someone who recognized his birth mother's name. At age 72, Gerald met his birth mother, Clora Mae Dalke Singer of Salem, OR. Her first words to him were, "I always wondered what happened to you. I always think of you especially on your birthday." His mother, now 93 years old, completed the story and named his birth father, Chester Arthur Varnes, who had just passed at age 91. Gerald learned he had two half-sisters on his mother's side: Cheryl Kelly, Rebecca Baer and a half-brother, Doug Singer.<br>
From the obituary of his birth father, Gerald learned he had a half-brother, David Arthur Varnes and wife, Jean, of Manassas, VA, and an aunt, June Bowersox, his father's youngest sister, and her husband, Joe Bowersox of Salem, OR. His birth father's family welcomed him with open arms and included him in the family gatherings of cousins. In 2010, Gerald met his half-brother, David, and for the first time, they each had a brother. The family resemblance was striking. Gerald would say, "After having no family, now I have lots." He cherished the new-found connections.<br>
Gerald's work history covered many locations. He was a foreman on projects such as the building of the Astoria Bridge, the CJ Stryker Dam in Idaho and the 700 and 500 Buildings in Portland. He ran construction crews for Guy F. Atkins and Morris and Knutsen. His father got him his first job in construction when he was only 14 since he was a big kid and could pass for older. He worked other jobs such as being a route builder for Carnation Milk company in Portland, OR; a real estate agent; had his own business, Thomas Home Improvements in Lincoln City, OR; then worked in marketing in the early 90s.<br>
Gerald was married to his Mt. Home high-school sweetheart, Virginia Naillon, and was thrilled to have a daughter, Theresa Kay and a son Richard Paul, both of whom were lost to him over the years.<br>
His last wife is Sandra Zimmer. (She was on the Fine Arts faculty at Linn-Benton Community College in Albany for 27 years.) They were together 26 years and lived in Lincoln City and Lebanon, OR, then traveled for several years as "full-timers" living in a Monaco Motor Coach. They finally purchased a home in Tucson, AZ, where they made their home for eight years. Gerald's interest in gold prospecting kept him digging the desert dirt with like-minded gold buddies and building sluice boxes to refine the process of reclaiming gold. He prospected in AZ in the winter and in OR in the summer.<br>
In July 2011, Gerald and his wife purchased a home in Baker City, OR, finally finding the place they wanted. Less than a month after they moved in, in late August, Gerald was told he had gleo-blastoma, a fast-growing brain cancer. The dream for the raised bed garden and raspberry bushes was over. The demise was swift and vicious. Gerald went to his "white day" on the early morning of November 4. 2011, from hospice care at the Presbyterian Community Care Center in Ontario, OR.<br>
Gerald's will requests that his name be added to his father, Richard W. Thomas' headstone in the Sumpter, OR, Cemetery. Instead of a service he requests a donation to be made to the Sumpter Valley Museum.<br>
