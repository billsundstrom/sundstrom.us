William Henry PARKER
<p>
<a name ="I061133"><b>[I061133]</b></a><br />
Parker, William Henry was born in Garfield County, Oklahoma on 8 June 1919 the son of Earl F. Parker and Nora S. Sargent. Bill attended high school in Enid, OK.<br>
He was a member of the Oklahoma National Guard when his unit was inducted into Federal service on 16 September 1940 at Enid, OK. At the time of his enlistment, he was a resident of Garfield County, OK. Bill was assigned to "B" Battery.<br>
On 8 November 1944 at 1210 hours, Lt. Flavey E. Baker and Private William H. Parker were in the vicinity of Migneville, France looking for a suitable observation post when their jeep ran over a mine. Private Parker was killed instantly and Lt. Baker received a fracture of the left arm and lacerations on the face. The vehicle was completely demolished. Lt. Baker was evacuated by the medical personnel of the 2nd French Armored Division and taken to the 51st Evacuation Hospital near Vincey, France. Private Bill Parker was the Deuceʼs third fatality since its arrival in France. His body was not immediately located after the accident. 1st Lieutenant Gurdon B. Flagg, "A" Battery Executive Officer, left the command post of the 202nd at 1325 hours for the area of the mine explosion. He returned two hours later with information concerning his investigation. The body of Private Parker was found 50 yards from the road. The French reported that several vehicles had passed over the same point previously during the day. The road had not been swept for mines. The following morning, 1st Lieutenant Richard G. Krahn, the HQ Battery Motor Officer, who was also the Battalion Graves Registration Officer, delivered the body of Private Parker to the XV Corps Graves Registration collecting point in Luneville. Bill was 25 years old and was survived by his wife and an infant daughter whom he never met. <br>
Bill was buried in the U.S. Military Cemetery at Epinal, France. Two copies of QMC Form  1 "Report of Burial" were placed in glass bottles and one was buried with the body and the other buried twelve inches below the grave marker. This would help later with identification when the remains were removed from the temporary grave. <br>
In 1948, his remains were repatriated to the United States. He was interred in the Enid, Oklahoma Cemetery on 9 June 1948.<br>

Davenport - Henry A. Parkhurst a/k/a "Hank" a/k/a "Pankus" a/k/a "The Magnificent One Called Great," 75, a resident of Davenport, snatched victory from the jaws of defeat on June 27, 2014, when he earned first place in the race to the inevitable following an extended illness.<br>
A Memorial Service to celebrate Hank's life will be Tuesday, July 1, 2014, at 10:30 a.m. at the Halligan-McCabe-DeVries Funeral Home, 614 Main St., downtown Davenport. The family will greet friends on Monday, June 30, 2014, from 4 p.m. until 7 p.m. at the funeral home. Burial will be at the Rock Island National Cemetery, Arsenal Island, with full military honors provided by the Vietnam Veterans of America Post 299.<br>
In lieu of flowers, memorials may be made to Clarissa C. Cook Hospice House in Bettendorf, Iowa.<br>
Henry Adams Parkhurst ("Hank"), Lt. Colonel, retired born July 18, 1938, in Rutland, Vermont, a son of Mary Robinson Parkhurst and Reverend John Queen Parkhurst. He married his lovely wife, Priscilla Ann Pullara. Their union resulted in four children: two girls, Heidi-Anne Poopalina and Amul the Wamul, two basically ugly sons, the Big Glumex and Dumkopf, and 12 lovely grandchildren. His children (and their spouses) were also known as John and Jaime Parkhurst, Heidi Parkhurst and Steve McCann, Amy and Kevin Richman, and Henry and Elizabeth Parkhurst; sister-in-law, Judy Parkhurst and a brother, Bill (Melissa) Parkhurst. He was preceded in death by his parents and a brother, Cliff Parkhurst.<br>
Best known for teaching Bruce Lee and Chuck Norris everything they know, Hank was also a courageous soldier in the United States Army. This Green Beret and Airborne Ranger served for 23 years receiving two purple hearts and earning two bronze stars for valor. Hank continued to live a life marked by tremendous courage. After serving his country for 23 years, Hank worked an additional 23 years at Merrill Lynch. He supported Neil Diamond in the '80s, cheered for the guy with the nice smile, and, on July 23, 1983, he walked straight into an East Davenport salon and got a perm. Did he consult his wife, Priscilla Parkhurst? Not this uncompromising hero! Despite his heroics, the couple remained married for 50 years come August 2014 with unrivaled dedication to one another.<br>
Hank loved many things including the Schwinn Airdyne, Flashance, golf, tennis, his anointed Hawkeyes, boot reer, the Bee Gees, a friendly game of cutthroat, the American flag, ham, Whitey's Turtles, marathon running, marathon eating, the Super Bowl Shuffle, Juan Jane, chocolate mousse, but nothing more than Priscilla Parkhurst.<br>
Unapologetically "Hank," he traveled through this world as an individual amongst conformists. Unbridled by social norms, pants were optional and completely unnecessary for answering the front door. Known by colleagues, friends and family for his myriad of funny saying and odd quirks, Hank drew people into a world where pretense was stripped away, laughter reigned supreme and everyone was welcome. For those of you drawn into his world, please come help us keep the faith.<br>
Bleepy Sigh Dad. To know you was to love you.<br>

Jerry Studstill PARR
<p>
<a name ="I024481"><b>[I024481]</b></a><br />
Family friends, meanwhile, reported that Mrs. Reagan was in good spirits and had, in her private conversations, provided additional details about the events after the shooting Monday afternoon.<br>
''Thank God for Jerry,'' friends quoted her as saying. Jerry S. Parr is the Secret Service agent who shoved Mr. Reagan into the Presidential limousine as a gunman sprayed bullets at the Presidential entourage.<br>
The President has told his wife that he felt ''an excruciatingly sharp pain'' in his chest. Mr. Reagan thought he had cracked a rib, when Mr. Parr, with the force of a football lineman, propelled him into the car and piled on top.<br>
As the car raced toward the White House, Mr. Parr said, ''Sit up, Mr. President.'' ''I can't sit up,'' Mr. Reagan told his bodyguard, who then directed the limousine to change course and head for the hospital. Mr. Parr is also credited by Mrs. Reagan with noticing blood on Mr. Reagan's lips, a key in alerting aides that they were wrong in assuming Mr. Reagan unhurt. <br>
By Howell Raines, The New York Times, 3 April 1981<br>
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
Jerry S. Parr, the quick-thinking and fast-moving Secret Service agent who was credited with saving the life of President Ronald Reagan after the 1981 assassination attempt in Washington, died Oct. 9 at a hospice center near his home in Washington. He was 85.<br>
The cause was congestive heart failure, said his wife, Carolyn Parr.<br>
Mr. Parr had been an electric power lineman before his Secret Service years and a clergyman in retirement. But he was best known for the fraught moments after gunfire erupted on March 30, 1981, as the president was leaving the Washington Hilton Hotel.<br>
In that time of chaos, Mr. Parr seemed the epitome of the firm-jawed man of action: forceful, resolute, decisive.<br>
At the presidentʼs side when the shots resounded, Mr. Parr did not immediately look for the gunman, John W. Hinckley Jr. Instead, according to accounts, Mr. Parr placed his hand on Reaganʼs shoulder and pushed the president into an awaiting limousine.<br>
The vehicle pulled away from the hotel, leaving behind a scene of blood and tumult. Also severely wounded by gunfire had been White House press secretary James S. Brady, Secret Service agent Timothy McCarthy and D.C. police officer Thomas Delahanty.<br>
Although Mr. Parr and the president were moving swiftly away from the carnage, shielded by the armor of a bullet-proof vehicle, the agentʼs responsibilities were far from over. Carefully, he ran his hands over Reaganʼs body, searching for bullet wounds. He found none.<br>
Then he recognized the ominous signs: The president complained about pain in his chest, and there was blood on Reaganʼs lips.<br>
Mr. Parr immediately ordered that the limo be driven to George Washington University Hospital instead of the White House. The president survived, but he had a close call.<br>
"If Jerry hadnʼt made the change," first lady Nancy Reagan later told CNN host Larry King, "I wouldn't have a husband."<br>
Doctors, noting the presidentʼs severe loss of blood, sometimes reported as three pints, have agreed with that assessment.<br>
In the aftermath of the assassination attempt, Mr. Parr was hailed for his cool capacity to confront danger and steer a path to safety. But the skills, instincts and abilities he demonstrated then gave an incomplete picture of his character and personality.<br>
Among those who knew him inside and outside the Secret Service, he was regarded as a patient man willing to hear out the troubled, to keep confidences and try to suggest a course of action.<br>
He was called on so often to play the part of wise adviser, according to his wife, that, after retiring from the Secret Service in 1985, he obtained a masterʼs degree in pastoral counseling from Loyola University in Baltimore and became co-pastor of Festival Church, an ecumenical church in Washingtonʼs Adams Morgan neighborhood.<br>
Jerry Studstill Parr was born in Montgomery, Ala., on Sept. 16, 1930, and he grew up in the Miami area. His first job was as a lineman for Florida Power and Light. It was often hazardous work, and he was pallbearer at the funerals of eight colleagues.<br>
When he applied to join the Secret Service in 1962, soon after graduating from Vanderbilt University in Nashville, he was asked at an interview about what motivated him to assume the perils of the job.<br>
As he recalled it, his wife said, he replied that he did not expect the work to be as dangerous as what he had been doing for the power company.<br>
In fact, Mr. Parr had been fascinated by the Secret Service from boyhood. His father had taken him in 1939 to see the low-budget action film "Code of the Secret Service," one of several movies in which Reagan starred as the dashing agent "Brass" Bancroft.<br>
"There's a couple of times where truth and training converge, where history and destiny converge," Mr. Parr told The Washington Post in 2006. "I thought about that for a long time. Itʼs that moment - either you do it or you don't, either you save him or you don't."<br>
Over the years, Mr. Parr met and provided security for some of the worldʼs most prominent figures. His career took him to all 50 states and 37 foreign countries. He helped to protect Pope John Paul II, and a photograph showed him alongside Japanese Emperor Hirohito. As deputy special agent in charge of the foreign dignitary division, he was credited with overseeing protection for more than 50 foreign heads of state.<br>
He had been assigned to Presidents Gerald Ford and Jimmy Carter and became head of the White House detail in the Presidential Protective Division in 1979.<br>
In recent years, he and his wife co-wrote "In the Secret Service," a memoir.<br>
In addition to his wife of 56 years, Carolyn Miller Parr, a former U.S. Tax Court judge, survivors include three daughters, Kimberly Parr of Syracuse, N.Y., Jennifer Parr Turek of Severna Park, Md., and Patricia Parr of Frederick, Md.; and four granddaughters.<br>
