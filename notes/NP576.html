<a name ="I109743"><b>[I109743]</b></a><br />
Professor Jane Welch Williams passed away April 18, 1998 in Tucson, Arizona, at home, at the age of 69. She is survived by her sister, Marjorie Sears of Los Angeles; her children, Brian Davis of the San Fernando Valley, California, Steven Davis of Denver, Colorado, Robin Dreyfuss of Ft. Lauderdale, Florida and Lorraine Roux of Houston, Texas and by her dear friend, Roy Williams of Tucson, Arizona.<br>
Jane was born in Los Angeles, California on October 15, 1928, the youngest daughter of Brian and Elizabeth Welch. Her grandfather, Arthur Parsons, designed and developed the canals of Naples, California; her great uncle, Jared Sidney Torrance, founded the city of Torrance, California. She attended Third Street Elementary School, John Burroughs Junior High School, Marlborough High School in Los Angeles and Bennington College in Vermont. Jane's fondest childhood memories were of growing up on a ranch in the San Fernando Valley of Los Angeles. She loved helping with the animals and going on long horse back rides. Her love of animals was life-long and was only equaled by her love of fishing. She spent many years taking her children out deep-sea fishing in pursuit of the mighty marlin and the elusive swordfish. She also enjoyed fly fishing for trout and lake fishing for bass.<br>
After raising four children, she went back to college to continue educating herself and started a whole second career as a teacher. She attended UCLA undergraduate and graduate school in Art History and earned a PhD in Medieval Art History. She began her distinguished teaching career at the University of Chicago in 1984-5, and then she moved to the University of Illinois at Champaign-Urbana in 1987-88. In 1988 she joined the Art History faculty at the University of Arizona. Jane Williams was an amazingly energetic scholar and teacher. Her book 'Bread, Wine and Money: the Trade Windows at Chartres Cathedral' added a new dimension of social analysis to the more traditional religious interpretation of the stained glass windows at Chartres Cathedral in France. She was the author of many papers and lectures in her field. Jane was also a beloved and dynamic teacher who received numerous University teaching awards and nominations; she was an inspiration to her students and colleagues. She galvanized the University community to form a joint PhD program in Art History with the Arizona State University and formed the 'Associates of Art History', a community group whose support has greatly enhanced the Art History program at the University of Arizona.<br>
To her friends and colleagues she was a treasured professional, an engaging host, a brilliant cook and a loyal friend. To her family she was a constant source of fun, support and love. She was completely dedicated to her children and grandchildren, whom she adored. All her grandchildren, Charlie, Stephanie, Andre, Jessica, Isabella, Rebecca, Katie, Kelly and Hunter, loved her to distraction and will carry the memory of 'Grandma Fish' all their lives. Her children, Brian, Steven, Robin and Lorraine, and her long-standing friend, Roy Williams, are devastated by her loss, but relieved that her long struggle with cancer is finally over. She is now at the great library in heaven, enjoying the fruits of a long and fulfilling life. In lieu of flowers, she asked for contributions to a scholarship fund in her memory. Please send donations for the Jane Welch Williams Memorial Fund, made out to 'The Associates of Art History' care of Julie Plax, PhD, Associate Professor of Art History, Dept. of Art and Art History, University of Arizona, P.O. Box 210002, Tucson, AZ 85721-0002. Private funeral services will be held for the family. All who loved and respected her are welcome to attend a Memorial Service on May 17, 1:30 p.m. at the Center for Creative Photography Auditorium at the University of Arizona. Her family is looking forward to seeing you there.<br>

UA art history professor dies at 69<br>
A vivacious art historian and UA professor died April 18 after an extended battle with a brain tumor.<br>
Jane Welch Williams, a 69-year-old historian of medieval art and architecture, was known in the academic world for her innovative interpretations of the stained glass windows at the Chartres Cathedral in France.<br>
To her students and co-workers, Williams was "a very young 69 - she was fun-loving and very curious," said Julie Plax, a professor of art history and Williams' colleague.<br>
"She had an enormous amount of energy," Plax said. "She loved giving parties and loved having a good time - she wanted other people to have as good a time as she was having."<br>
Williams, who was diagnosed with an inoperable brain tumor in October 1996, became a University of Arizona faculty member in 1988.<br>
She received her master's and doctoral degrees from the University of California at Los Angeles, and was a professor at the University of Chicago and University of Illinois before teaching at the UA.<br>
She took a medical leave of absence in 1996, but before she was diagnosed with the tumor, she taught a wide variety of UA art history courses.<br>
"I'll always remember her infectious enthusiasm," said Sharon Parker, a graduate student in art history.<br>
"She loved her work and communicated that to the people around her," Parker said. "She taught me to love what you're doing and do it well."<br>
Williams' specialty was French Gothic art. In that area she published many papers and a book, Bread, Wine and Money: The Trade Windows at Chartres Cathedral.<br>
Plax said everyone in the Art History Department will miss Williams and the enthusiasm she brought to every project.<br>
"She was an avid fisherwoman - she even found places around here when she couldn't get to the open sea," Plax said.<br>
Parker said Williams knew she was living with a death sentence, but that it never stopped her from sharing her excitement about living with others.<br>
"She really demonstrated how to persevere in the face of personal adversity," Parker said. "I think that's a lesson for all of us - you need to complete the work you've set out for yourself."<br>
Williams is survived by her companion Roy Williams, four children and eight grandchildren.<br>
A memorial service will be held May 17 at 1:30 p.m. in the UA Center for Creative Photography Auditorium.<br>

December 19, 1924 - September 7, 2011<br>
Marjorie Welch Sears was born in Los Angeles, California where she attended the Marlborough School. She then received a B.A from Sarah Lawrence College in New York before returning to her home state. In December 1948 she married Robert Eugene Sears, her beloved husband until his passing in 2000. Together they raised three children, Marjorie, Elizabeth Edythe and Robert Jr.<br>
She later returned to school and received a Masters Degree in Fine Arts from the Otis Art Institute in Los Angeles. Throughout the remainder of her life, she pursued her artistic passion in her converted garage studio, where she produced numerous paintings, sculptures and etchings.<br>
Her interests were many and all actively pursued. She was a competitive athlete (14 handicap in golf), voracious reader, fly fisherman, a Life Master in Bridge, and an active supporter of numerous museums and conservation groups; she adopted an elephant in the Amboseli Reserve, and assisted in numerous bird counts for the Audubon Society. Marjorie was also a great cook and gourmand, authoring a cookbook on Southwestern cuisine.<br>
She had a memorable, infectious, waist-bending laugh. She loved a good prank and that was why April Fool's Day was her favorite "holiday." However, she also taught by example and, for those that observed, they witnessed someone who embraced life fully, whether gardening, rescuing stray dogs, traveling, learning foreign languages, or just listening to classical music or Frank Sinatra.<br>
She is survived by her loving children and three grandchildren, Betty, Robert III and Caitlin, and a daughter-in-law Nancy and son-in-law Michael.<br>
Ultimately, Marjorie was a humble person who would disapprove of making any "fuss" for her, including this obituary. She requested that there be no public memorial service, and instead the family will gather to celebrate her life.<br>

<a name ="I061490"><b>[I061490]</b></a><br />
Dad passed at about 11:00 this morning, not as he wished, but we don't get to make those choices. He wanted to go in his sleep, unfortunately his sleep was morphine induced in his last days. The Hospice nurse thinks his prostate cancer had metastized into bone cancer.<br>
Charles Newton Weller, aged 90 and a few days.<br>
Dad grew up in western New York, a little burg called Dunkirk not far from the lake. He had a life long passion for photography, but was never able to make a living at it, so he found employment as a pressman working for various newspapers in New York, Arizona and California. He retired from the Fresno Bee 25 years ago, and spent many of the remaining years indulging his other passion, which was fishing.<br>
He taught me how to fish for salmon on the Sacramento river in the mid '90's. We had many a fine day on the river with the sun shining and lots of teasing to go around. My best effort was a 46 pounder, which he had a tremendous laugh over, because I snagged it by the tail. I believe his all time record was over 50 pounds. They all tasted great, regardless...especially after smoking!<br>
He also enjoyed doing photo restorations for people. He would take old photos that had been damaged over time by mishandling, and make them look new again. He never charged for doing this, taking his payment in smiles when people saw the restored piece. They were always thrilled when some family heirloom with fold lines, water damage etc. was brought back to life, and he took great joy is seeing the looks on their faces. He would spend days and days getting them to look just like new. It was really sad when he realized that as the Alzheimer's progressed that he couldn't do it anymore, as he couldn't remember how to use the software any longer. We have over 8000 photos to go through, and a couple thousand slides. That's a LOT of family history!<br>
After his wife passed 10 years ago, he had another lady friend, and they had a grand time going here and there. They both loved to dance, and had many a fine evening doing so.<br>
Dad was an absolute gem of a man, with never a bad word to say about anybody.<br>
RIP - you will be sorely missed.<br>

History of Wells Implement, Inc. - Legacy created for children, grandchildren<br>
Before he died in March of 1998 at the age of 101, A.B. Wells created a legacy for his son and his son's children by opening an implement store in Plymouth, Nebr. Currently, the third generation of Wells own and operate the business on Plymouth's main street in a building their grandfather built.<br>
The senior Wells opened the business in 1940, having moved his wife, Merna, son Arthur, and daughter, Glenola, to Plymouth from Fairbury, Nebr. His son, Art Jr., a teen-ager at the time, worked with his father in the business while attending school in Plymouth. The junior Wells graduated from Plymouth High School in 1945 and was drafted into the U.S. Army the following fall. Returning from the Army, Art Jr. began working with his father full-time. Art Jr. married a high school classmate, Alverta Rehm, on Nov. 27, 1949, and over the next 10 years the Wells household grew as three children were born -- daughter, Pamela, and sons, Greg and Mark.<br>
The father-son arrangement between A.B. and Art Jr., under the business name of A.B. Wells and Son, continued until 1964 when Art Jr. and Alverta bought the business and A.B. retired.<br>
While still youngsters, Greg and Mark Wells began working with their parents in the family business. Although both left Plymouth to attend college, they later returned to full-time work at the business now known as Wells Implement Inc. By the time their father decided to retire, each of them already had more than 20 years of experience in the business. Greg is now service manager while Mark fills the position of parts manager. Mark's wife, Deb, works in the office on a part-time basis.<br>
Pam's husband, Charlie Hoge, has also worked in the business for more than 30 years. He began in the service department and became sales manager when Art Jr. retired. With her brothers and husband already involved in the business, Pam took over the bookkeeping duties from her mother when her parents retired in 1995. She now serves as president of the business.<br>
"This is the third generation in there now," Art Jr. says. "This is the oldest Allis Chalmers dealership, now AGCO Allis, in Nebraska that is still in the same family name." Keeping the business in the family since 1940 is an accomplishment the entire family can be proud of, Art Jr. says.<br>
It means a lot to the three Wells grandchildren to be carrying on the family tradition in the business. "I feel Grandpa started something really special for us," Pam says. "It's amazing to stop and think about what the business must have been like when Grandpa started it. They had just one or two people outside the family involved in it. Now we have 12 full-time employees."<br>
Mark says working in the business is a way of life. "The business has always been there," he says. "The customers come back and you make friends with them."<br>
Greg compares the family business to a family farm. "The farm is handed down and that makes is possible for the younger generation to farm," he says. "If you had to go out and buy farmland and start from scratch, you'd have a tough time of it. It's the same way here. That's when you appreciate what your family has done for you."<br>
Charlie and Pam have two married daughters, Wendy, Mrs. Ken McKenzie, of Kearney, Nebr., and Lorie, Mrs. Wade Heidemann, of Lincoln, Nebr. They also are the proud grandparents of Garrett, Paige and Ethan McKenzie.<br>
Greg and his wife, Ruth, have one daughter, April, Mrs. Greg Teet, of Cortland, Nebr.<br>
Mark and Deb have three children -- Larissa, 16, Benjamin, 15, and Michael, 14, who help out in the store when time permits. The fourth generation<br>
