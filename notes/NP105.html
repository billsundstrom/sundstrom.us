<h2>Notes</h2>
Muriel Kathleen CRAIG
<p>
<a name ="I042663"><b>[I042663]</b></a><br />
MORTON - We are saddened by the passing of our beloved wife, mother, grandmother and sister on Tuesday, September 16, 1997. Muriel Kathleen was born April 14, 1922, the fifth of eight children of Owen and Mollie Craig of Vulcan, Alberta. In 1941, she became the young bride of Les Christensen. They farmed for several years in the Champion district where they raised four children, Marilyn, Judy, Nancy and Keith. Kaye was always an active and valued contributor to community life in Champion. Her love of music and young people led her to serve as long-time director of the United Church Junior Choir and as leader of CGIT, Explorer and Sunday School groups. She also valued the camaraderie and support of her friends in the Felicity Club. Later, she moved to Calgary and built a new career as a respected medical records administrator. In 1971, Kaye married Arthur Morton. Together they have shared many happy years square dancing and traveling the world, and have enjoyed the close friendship of their neighbors on Vancouver Crescent. The joy and pride Kaye had in her twelve grandchildren and three great-grandchildren gave her much strength through her lifetime, and she never missed an opportunity to participate in family activities. For this we remember her - she will always be our "Grandma Precious". A Memorial Service will be held at McINNIS & HOLLOWAY'S "Crowfoot Chapel" (82 Crowfoot Circle N.W.), on Friday, September 19, 1997 at 1:00 p.m. If friends so desire, memorial tributes may be made directly to the Heartwood Bursary, Naramata Centre, Box 68, Naramata, B.C., V0H 1N0, or to the Alberta Literacy Foundation, No. 211, 332 - 6 Avenue S.E., Calgary, Alberta T2G 4S6.

Joining the navy and eventually venturing into the business world on many adventures, from promoting Silly Putty to the Jolly Jumper and eventually publishing. One of Ron's greatest feats was purchasing a 3 Masted Barque sailing ship called the Monte Cristo and eventually renaming it the Endeavour ll where he portrayed Captain Cook on a daily basis re-enacting the 1970 Bi-Centennial of Captain Cooks discovery of Australia with the Queen of England and Prince Philip.

<a name ="I021466"><b>[I021466]</b></a><br />
August 10, 1905 - A Strange Bit of Family History. - About the year 1822 William Craig came from Londonderry, Ireland, to Nova Scotia and settled at Morristown, Aylesford. About the year 1825 his brother, James Craig, left the old home in Ireland and came to Philadelphia. Here the two brothers lost sight of each other for life. William Craig remained in Kings County and raised a family, all of whom settled in their native province. His brother, James Craig,<br>
married in Philadelphia and went as a missionary to India, where he died in 1845. Mrs. Craig with four little children returned to her former home in Philadelphia where she raised her family. These two families, cousins, lived on for some sixty years, one in Nova Scotia, the other in Pennsylvania, each entirely ignorant of the existence of the other. Last autumn Miss Annie Craig, of Philadelphia, in a mysterious way, heard that there was a family of Craigs in Kings County, Nova Scotia. She at once wrote to them to know if they were descendants of William Craig, her uncle, who, as she had heard, settled in Nova Scotia. A correspondence at once began between the two families, and on Saturday last Miss Craig from Philadelphia arrived in Cambridge on a visit to her newly discovered cousins, who were overjoyed to meet her, having never previously seen one of their relatives on their father's side. Miss Craig, who is a very intelligent lady, is much pleased with the country. She is at present the guest of her cousin, James Craig, and his family.<br>

Beverley Anne DeWinter [nee Craine] passed away on March 11, 2018 at the age of 86 years, at the Edmonton General Continuing Care Centre.<br>
Beverley was born July 16, 1931, in Lethbridge, to parents Jack Craine and Ellen Glambeck. After taking education in Calgary, she taught school in the farming community of Big Meadow, where she met and married local farmer, Albert DeWinter, in 1953. The couple raised four children, farmed, and traveled, while Beverley continued to teach until her retirement in 1987, from the Holy Roman Catholic School, St. Andrew始s, in High Prairie.<br>
Following the death of her husband in 1995, Beverley sold the farm and moved into High Prairie, where she lived for the next 13 years, continuing to spend as much time with her family and traveling as possible. Due to increasing mobility issues, in 2008 Beverley moved to the Waterford Assisted living facility in Edmonton, where she was closer to her grandchildren, made many new friends and was soon part of a new church family.<br>
In 2016, due to her declining health, Beverley went into the Edmonton General Continuing Care Centre.<br>
Beverley was a strong person, who loved her family, friends, socializing, traveling, teaching, gardening, bowling, square dancing, puzzles and genealogy. Although she suffered most of her life with debilitating arthritis, she never let it affect her positive outlook on life, feel sorry for herself, or let it stop her from doing the things she loved.<br>
Beverley enjoyed life, and never forgot any of her family始s birthdays, or milestones. She never missed an opportunity to stop for a visit, making new friends wherever she went, and always took the time to stop and smell and/or appreciate the flowers.<br>
Beverley will always be remembered and sadly missed by all those who knew her. Including her son Frank and wife Carol DeWinter of Pittsburgh, Penn.; daughter Anne Gagne, of Mayerthorpe, AB; daughter Sally Taylor and partner Guy Boulet of High Prairie; and daughter Julie DeWinter and partner Geordie Lee of Grande Prairie; 13 grandchildren, including Robert DeWinter, Christina [Luke Radke], Frances [Frank Visser], and Audrey DeWinter; Kurt, Tracy, and Michelle Gagne; Shawna, Laura [Andrew Hook], and Kyle [Meghan Seitz] Taylor; John, Aaron [Victoria MacNeil], and Jamie Lee [Jamie missing since September 2011]; and four great-grandchildren: Cole Gagne; Eva, Hilary, and Ruby Radke.<br>
Beverley was predeceased by: her parents and both brothers; grandson, Ted DeWinter, in 1983; husband, Albert DeWinter in 1995; and son-in-law Philippe Gagne in 2013.<br>
A celebration of remembrance will be held for Beverley at 1 p.m. on June 3, 2018 at the University of Alberta Botanical Gardens [formerly the Devonian Botanical Gardens] in Edmonton. All Beverley始s family and friends are welcome to attend.<br>
The family would like to give special thanks to the staff on floor 7Y at the Edmonton General Continuing Care Centre, for the care and compassion they showed Beverley during her stay with them.<br>
We would also like to say a special thanks to Bev始s granddaughter-in-law, Meghan [Kyle] Taylor, for all the time and love she gave to our mom over the past several years.<br>
In lieu of flowers, donations may be made in Beverley始s name to The Edmonton General Continuing Care Centre, via Covenant Health, Edmonton, Alta.<br>
