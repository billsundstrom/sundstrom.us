<h2>Notes</h2>
Hilarion Theodore WELTER
<p>
<a name ="I040525"><b>[I040525]</b></a><br />
Hilarion T. "Doc" Welter, age 90, a life-long Crookston, Minnesota resident, died peacefully at the home of his daughter, Mona Heglin , in Surprise, Arizona.<br>
Doc was going to be spending the winter there and his passing was unexpected.<br>
He was born in Crookston on July 27, 1920, and was the son of Nicholas and Catherine (Averbeck) Welter. He was baptized and confirmed in the Catholic faith and graduated from the Cathedral High School in 1939. On May 6, 1941 Doc was united in marriage to Lauretta C. Cournia in Crookston.<br>
Together, they would raise two daughters and a son: Mona , Jerry, and Joyce. Early in their marriage they moved with their firstborn, Mona , to Superior, Wisconsin while Doc worked in the shipyard there for a few years in support of the war effort. After returning to Crookston he was employed as a plumber, and then in July of 1951 joined the Crookston Fire Department.<br>
He was named Fire Chief in the Spring of 1961 and held that position until his retirement from the Department in 1983. Doc and Lauretta enjoyed traveling and spent 18 winters in Texas. Sadly, Lauretta passed away on August 14, 2005.<br>
Doc was a lifelong member of the Cathedral of the Immaculate Conception, and also held membership in the Knights of Columbus and Crookston Eagles Aerie #873.<br>
He liked to do woodworking, and was an avid model-railroader.<br>
Doc spent many, many hours working on the railroad display he set up in his basement.<br>
It was his pride and joy and he enjoyed showing it off to visitors, and to fellow members of the Northern Lights Railroad Club he belonged to in East Grand Forks. Over the years Doc spent lots of time pulling his kids around the lake on water-skis; and being with them was his greatest joy.<br>
His family is grateful to have been able to share in his life for so many years, and they will cherish many wonderful memories of a great husband, dad, grandpa, and great grandpa.<br>
Loving family members include his 3 children: Mona (Ron) Heglin of Surprise, AZ, Jerry (LaVonne) Welter of Kirkhoven, MN, and Joyce (Pete) Habben of East Grand Forks, MN; 6 grandchildren: Michael, Kim, Stacy, Lisa, Mark, and Chris; and 13 great grandchildren.<br>
Doc also leaves several sisters-in-law and brothers-in-law including: Donna Welter of Bemidji, MN, Rose Marie (Marvin) Torgerson of Racine, WI, Anna Mae Sullivan of Ankeny, IA, Louis (Nancy) Cournia of Crookston, MN, Melvin Podevels of Milwaukee, WI, and Art Pretory of Hemet, CA; as well as, nieces, nephews, and other relatives.<br>
In addition to his beloved wife of sixty-four years, Lauretta, Doc was preceded in death by his parents; 2 brothers, Donald and Raymond Welter; and several brothers in-law and sisters-in-law: Delmont and Lorraine Cournia, Lavonne and Allen Hoeft, Esther and Bernard Palubicki, LeRoy and Eleanor Cournia, Aubrie "Peg" and Donna Moran, John "Jack" Sullivan, Margaret Podevels, and Betty Pretory.<br>
A Memorial Mass celebrating the life of Hilarion T. "Doc" Welter will be held at 10:30 am, Monday, June 6, 2011, in the Cathedral of the Immaculate Conception in Crookston with The Very Rev.<br>
Bob Schreiner, presiding.<br>
Visitation with Doc's family will be for one hour prior to the service. Members of the Crookston Fire Department, past and present, will serve as honorary pallbearers.<br>
Burial will be in the Calvary Cemetery.<br>

Alfred of WESSEX
<p>
<a name ="I005172"><b>[I005172]</b></a><br />
Alfred (b. 849, d. 899)<br>
also spelled AELFRED, byname ALFRED THE GREAT king of Wessex (871-899), a Saxon kingdom in southwestern England. He prevented England from falling to the Danes and promoted learning and literacy. Compilation of the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle began during his reign, c. 890.<br>
<br>
When he was born, it must have seemed unlikely that Alfred would become king, since he had four older brothers; he said that he never desired royal power. Perhaps a scholar's life would have contented him. His mother early aroused his interest in English poetry, and from his boyhood he also hankered after Latin learning, possibly stimulated by visits to Rome in 853 and 855. It is possible also that he was aware of and admired the great Frankish king Charlemagne, who had at the beginning of the century revived learning in his realm. Alfred had no opportunity to acquire the education he sought, however, until much later in life.<br>
<br>
He probably received the education in military arts normal for a young man of rank. He first appeared on active service in 868, when he and his brother, King Aethelred (Ethelred) I, went to help Burgred of Mercia (the kingdom between the Thames and the Humber) against a great Danish army that had landed in East Anglia in 865 and taken possession of Northumbria in 867. The Danes refused to give battle, and peace was made. In this year Alfred married Ealhswith, descended through her mother from Mercian kings. Late in 871, the Danes invaded Wessex, and Aethelred and Alfred fought several battles with them. Aethelred died in 871 and Alfred succeeded him. After an unsuccessful battle at Wilton he made peace. It was probably the quality of the West Saxon resistance that discouraged Danish attacks for five years.<br>
<br>
In 876 the Danes again advanced on Wessex: they retired in 877 having accomplished little, but a surprise attack in January 878 came near to success. The Danes established themselves at Chippenham, and the West Saxons submitted "except King Alfred." He harassed the Danes from a fort in the Somerset marshes, and until seven weeks after Easter he secretly assembled an army, which defeated them at the Battle of Edington. They surrendered, and their king, Guthrum, was baptized, Alfred standing as sponsor; the following year they settled in East Anglia.<br>
<br>
Wessex was never again in such danger. Alfred had a respite from fighting until 885, when he repelled an invasion of Kent by a Danish army, supported by the East Anglian Danes. In 886 he took the offensive and captured London, a success that brought all the English not under Danish rule to accept him as king. The possession of London also made possible the re-conquest of the Danish territories in his son's reign, and Alfred may have been preparing for this, though he could make no further advance himself. He had to meet a serious attack by a large Danish force from the European continent in 892, and it was not until 896 that it gave up the struggle.<br>
<br>
The failure of the Danes to make any more advances against Alfred was largely a result of the defensive measures he undertook during the war. Old forts were strengthened and new ones built at strategic sites, and arrangements were made for their continual manning. Alfred reorganized his army and used ships against the invaders as early as 875. Later he had larger ships built to his own design for use against the coastal raids that continued even after 896. Wise diplomacy also helped Alfred's defense. He maintained friendly relations with Mercia and Wales; Welsh rulers sought his support and supplied some troops for his army in 893.<br>
<br>
Alfred succeeded in government as well as at war. He was a wise administrator, organizing his finances and the service due from his thanes (noble followers). He scrutinized the administration of justice and took steps to ensure the protection of the weak from oppression by ignorant or corrupt judges. He promulgated an important code of laws, after studying the principles of lawgiving in the Book of Exodus and the codes of Aethelbert of Kent, Ine of Wessex (688-694), and Offa of Mercia (757-796), again with special attention to the protection of the weak and dependent. While avoiding unnecessary changes in custom, he limited the practice of the blood feud and imposed heavy penalties for breach of oath or pledge.<br>
<br>
Alfred is most exceptional, however, not for his generalship or his administration but for his attitude toward learning. He shared the contemporary view that Viking raids were a divine punishment for the people's sins, and he attributed these to the decline of learning, for only through learning could men acquire wisdom and live in accordance with God's will. Hence, in the lull from attack between 878 and 885, he invited scholars to his court from Mercia, Wales, and the European continent. He learned Latin himself and began to translate Latin books into English in 887. He directed that all young freemen of adequate means must learn to read English, and, by his own translations and those of his helpers, he made available English versions of "those books most necessary for all men to know," books that would lead them to wisdom and virtue. The Ecclesiastical History of the English People, by the English historian Bede, and the Seven Books of Histories Against the Pagans, by Paulus Orosius, a 5th-century theologian--neither of which was translated by Alfred himself, though they have been credited to him--revealed the divine purpose in history. Alfred's translation of the Pastoral Care of St. Gregory I, the great 6th-century pope, provided a manual for priests in the instruction of their flocks, and a translation by Bishop Werferth of Gregory's Dialogues supplied edifying reading on holy men. Alfred's rendering of the Soliloquies of the 5th-century theologian St. Augustine of Hippo, to which he added material from other works of the Fathers of the Church, discussed problems concerning faith and reason and the nature of eternal life. This translation deserves to be studied in its own right, as does his rendering of Boethius' Consolation of Philosophy. In considering what is true happiness and the relation of providence to faith and of predestination to free will, Alfred does not fully accept Boethius' position but depends more on the early Fathers. In both works, additions include parallels from contemporary conditions, sometimes revealing his views on the social order and the duties of kingship. Alfred wrote for the benefit of his people, but he was also deeply interested in theological problems for their own sake and commissioned the first of the translations, Gregory's Dialogues, "that in the midst of earthly troubles he might sometimes think of heavenly things." He may also have done a translation of the first 50 psalms. Though not Alfred's work, the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, one of the greatest sources of information about Saxon England, which began to be circulated about 890, may have its origin in the intellectual interests awakened by the revival of learning under him. His reign also saw activity in building and in art, and foreign craftsmen were attracted to his court.<br>
<br>
In one of his endeavours, however, Alfred had little success; he tried to revive monasticism, founding a monastery and a nunnery, but there was little enthusiasm in England for the monastic life until after the revivals on the European continent in the next century.<br>
<br>
Alfred, alone of Anglo-Saxon kings, inspired a full-length biography, written in 893, by the Welsh scholar Asser. This work contains much valuable information, and it reveals that Alfred labored throughout under the burden of recurrent, painful illness; and beneath Asser's rhetoric can be seen a man of attractive character, full of compassion, able to inspire affection, and intensely conscious of the responsibilities of kingly office. This picture is confirmed by Alfred's laws and writings.<br>
<br>
Alfred was never forgotten: his memory lived on through the middle ages and in legend as that of a king who won victory in apparently hopeless circumstances and as a wise lawgiver. Some of his works were copied as late as the 12th century. Modern studies have increased knowledge of him but have not altered in its essentials the medieval conception of a great king. (D.W.)<br>

From Wikipedia<br>
<br>
Alfred (849? - 26 October 899) (sometimes spelt Ælfred) was king of the southern Anglo-Saxon kingdom of Wessex from 871 to 899. Alfred is famous for his defence of the kingdom against the Danes (Vikings), becoming as a result the only English monarch to be awarded the epithet "the Great" by his people. Details of his life are known as a result of a work by the Welsh scholar, Asser. A learnèd man, Alfred encouraged education and improved the kingdom's law system.<br>
<br>
Childhood<br>
Alfred was born sometime between 847 and 849 AD at Wantage in Berkshire (alterations to county borders in 1974 mean that Wantage is now part of Oxfordshire), the fourth son of King Ethelwulf of Wessex (or Æthelwulf), most likely by his first wife, Osburh. He succeeded his brother, Ethelred I, as King of Wessex and Mercia in 871.<br>
<br>
He seems to have been a child of singular attractiveness and promise, and tales of his boyhood were remembered. At five years old, in 853, he is said to have been sent to Rome, where he was confirmed by Pope Leo IV, who is also said to have "anointed him as king." Later writers took this as an anticipatory crowning in preparation for his ultimate succession to the throne of Wessex. That, however, could not have been foreseen in 853, as Alfred had three elder brothers living. It is likely to be understood either of investiture with the consular insignia or possibly with some titular royalty such as that of the under-kingdom of Kent.<br>
<br>
This tale is likely apocryphal, though in 854?855 Alfred almost certainly did go with his father on a pilgrimage to Rome, spending some time at the court of Charles the Bald, King of the Franks. In 858, Ethelwulf died.<br>
<br>
Public life<br>
During the short reigns of his two eldest brothers, Ethelbald and Ethelbert, nothing is heard of Alfred. But with the accession of the third brother, Ethelred, in 866 the public life of Alfred began, and he began his great work of delivering England from the Danes. It is in this reign that Asser applies to Alfred the unique title of secundarius, which seems to show a position akin to that of the Celtic tanist, a recognized successor, closely associated with the reigning prince. It is likely that this arrangement was sanctioned by the Witenagemot, to guard against the danger of a disputed succession should Aethelred fall in battle. The arrangement of crowning a successor as co-king, however, is well-known among Germanic tribes, such as the Swedes, and the Franks, with whom the Anglo-Saxons had close ties (see diarchy and Germanic king).<br>
Alfred the Great's birthplace Wantage boasts a statue of its greatest son.<br>
<br>
In 868 Alfred married Ealhswith, daughter of Aethelred Mucill, who is called ealdorman of the Gaini, a folk who dwelt in Lincolnshire about Gainsborough. She was the granddaughter of a former King of Mercia, and they had five or six children, one a daughter, Ethelfleda, who would become queen of Mercia in her own right.<br>
<br>
The same year Alfred, fighting beside his brother Ethelred, made an unsuccessful attempt to relieve Mercia from the pressure of the Danes. For nearly two years Wessex had a respite. But at the end of 870 the storm burst; and the year which followed has been rightly called "Alfred's year of battles."<br>
<br>
Nine general engagements were fought with varying fortune, though the place and date of two of them have not been recorded. A successful skirmish at Battle of Englesfield, Berkshire (31 December 870), was followed by a severe defeat at the Battle of Reading (4 January 871), and this, four days later, by the brilliant victory of Battle of Ashdown, near Compton Beauchamp in Shrivenham Hundred.<br>
<br>
On 22 January 871 the English were again defeated at Basing, and on 22 March 871 at Marton, Wiltshire, the two unidentified battles having perhaps occurred in the interval.<br>
<br>
Accession<br>
In April Ethelred died, and Alfred succeeded to the whole burden of the contest. While he was busied with the burial and associated ceremonies for his brother, the Danes defeated the English in his absence at an unnamed spot, and once more in his presence at Wilton in May. After this peace was made, and for the next five years the Danes were occupied in other parts of England, Alfred merely keeping a force of observation on the border. But in 876, the Danes, under a new leader, Guthrum, slipped past him and attacked Wareham. From there, early in 877 and under the pretext of talks, they made a dash westwards and took Exeter. Here Alfred blockaded them, and a relieving fleet having been scattered by a storm, the Danes had to submit and withdraw to Mercia. But in January 878 they made a sudden swoop on Chippenham, a royal stronghold in which Alfred had been keeping his Christmas, "and most of the people they reduced, except the King Alfred, and he with a little band made his way  by wood and swamp, and after Easter he  made a fort at Athelney, and from that fort kept fighting against the foe" (Chronicle).<br>

A legend tells how, while a fugitive in the marshes of Athelney near North Petherton in Somerset, after the first Danish invasion, he was given shelter by a peasant woman who, ignorant of his identity, left him to watch some cakes she had left cooking on the fire. Preoccupied with the problems of the kingdom, Alfred let the cakes burn, and was taken to task by the woman on her return. Upon realizing the king's identity, the woman apologized profusely, but Alfred insisted that he was the one who needed to apologize. The thought that Alfred, during his retreat at Athelney, was a helpless fugitive rests upon the legend of the cakes. In truth he was organizing victory. At about the same time, he is supposed to have disguised himself as a harpist to gain entry to Guthrum's camp and discover his plans.<br>
<br>
By the middle of May, his preparations were complete and he moved out of Athelney, being joined on the way by the levies of Somerset, Wiltshire and Hampshire. The Danes on their side moved out of Chippenham, and the two armies met at the Battle of Edington in Wiltshire. The result was a decisive victory for Alfred. The Danes submitted. Guthrum, the Danish king, and twenty-nine of his chief men took baptism. As a result, England became split into two, the south-western half kept by the Saxons and the north-eastern half becoming known as the Danelaw. By the next year (879) not only Wessex, but Mercia, west of Watling Street, was cleared of the invader. This is the arrangement known to historians as the peace of Wedmore (878), though no document embodying its provisions is in existence.<br>
<br>
Though for the time being the north-eastern half of England, including London, was in the hands of the Danes, in truth the tide had turned. For the next few years there was peace, the Danes being kept busy in Europe. A landing in Kent in 884 or 885, though successfully repelled, encouraged the East Anglian Danes to rise up. The measures taken by Alfred to repress this uprising culminated in the taking of London in 885 or 886, and the treaty known as Alfred and Guthrum's peace, whereby the boundaries of the treaty of Wedmore (with which this is often mistaken) were materially modified to Alfred's gain.<br>
<br>
Once more for a time there was a lull; but in the fall of 892 or 893 the last storm burst. The Danes, finding their position in Europe becoming more and more precarious, crossed to England in two divisions, amounting in the aggregate to 330 sail, and entrenched themselves, the larger body at Appledore, Kent, and the lesser under Haesten at Milton also in Kent. The fact that the new invaders brought their wives and children with them shows that this was no mere raid, but a meaningful attempt, in concert with the Northumbrian and East Anglian Danes, to conquer England. Alfred, in 893 or 894, took up a position whence he could observe both forces. While he was in talks with Haesten the Danes at Appledore broke out and struck north-westwards, but were overtaken by Alfred's eldest son, Edward, and defeated in a general engagement at Farnham, and driven to take refuge in Thorney Island in the Hertfordshire Colne, where they were blockaded and ultimately compelled to submit. They then fell back on Essex, and after suffering another defeat at Benfleet coalesced with Haesten's force at Shoebury.<br>
<br>
Alfred had been on his way to relieve his son at Thorney when he heard that the Northumbrian and East Anglian Danes were besieging Exeter and an unnamed stronghold on the North Devon shore. Alfred at once hurried westward and raised the siege of Exeter; the fate of the other place is not recorded. Meanwhile the force under Haesten set out to march up the Thames Valley, possibly with the idea of assisting their friends in the west. But they were met by a large force under the three great ealdormen of Mercia, Wiltshire and Somerset, and made to head off to the north-west, being finally overtaken and blockaded at Buttington, which some identify with Buttington Tump at the mouth of the Wye River, others with Buttington near Welshpool. An attempt to break through the English lines was defeated with loss; those who escaped retreated to Shoebury. Then after collecting reinforcements they made a sudden dash across England and occupied the ruined Roman walls of Chester. The English did not attempt a winter blockade, but contented themselves with destroying all the supplies in the neighbourhood. And early in 894 (or 895) want of food obliged the Danes to retire once more to Essex. At the end of this year and early in 895 (or 896) the Danes drew their ships up the Thames and Lea and fortified themselves twenty miles above London. A direct attack on the Danish lines failed, but later in the year Alfred saw a means of obstructing the river so as to prevent the egress of the Danish ships. The Danes realized that they were out-maneuvred. They struck off north-westwards and wintered at Bridgenorth. The next year, 896 (or 897), they gave up the struggle. Some retired to Northumbria, some to East Anglia; those who had no connections in England withdrew to the continent. The long campaign was over.<br>
<br>
The result testifies to the confidence inspired by Alfred's character and generalship, and to the efficacy of the military reforms initiated by him. These were:<br>
   1. the division of the fyrd or national militia into two, relieving each other at set intervals, so as to ensure continuity in military operations;<br>
   2. the building of strongholds (burgs) and garrisons at certain points;<br>
   3. the enforcement of the obligations of thanehood on all owners of five hides of land, thus giving the king a nucleus of highly equipped troops.<br>
<br>
Reorganization<br>
After the dispersal of the Danish invaders Alfred turned his attention to the increase of the royal navy, and ships were built according to the king's own designs, partly to repress the ravages of the Northumbrian and East Anglian Danes on the coasts of Wessex, partly to prevent the landing of fresh hordes. This is not, as often asserted, the beginning of the English navy. There had been earlier naval operations under Alfred. One naval engagement was certainly fought under Æthelwulf (in 851), and earlier ones, possibly in 833 and 840. The partisan Anglo-Saxon Chronicle credits Alfred with the construction of a new type of boat, 'swifter, steadier and also higher/more responsive (hierran) than the others'; but these new ships were not a great success, as we hear of them grounding in action and foundering in a storm. Nevertheless both the Royal Navy and the United States Navy claim Alfred as the founder of their traditions.<br>
<br>
Alfred's main fighting force was separated into two, 'so that there was always half at home and half out' (Anglo-Saxon Chronicle). The level of organization required to mobilise his large army in two shifts of which one was feeding the other must have been considerable. The complexity which Alfred's administration had attained by 892 is demonstrated by a reasonably reliable charter whose witness list includes a thesaurius, cellararius and pincerna-treasurer, food-keeper and butler. Despite the irritation which Alfred must have felt in 893, when one division, which had 'completed their call-up (stemn)' gave up the siege of a Danish army even as Alfred was moving to relieve them, this system seems to have worked remarkably well on the whole.<br>
<br>
One of the weaknesses of pre-Alfredian defences had been that, in the absence of a standing army, fortresses were largely left unoccupied, making it very possible for a Viking force quickly to secure a strong strategic position. Alfred substantially upgraded the state of many of Wessex's fortresses, as has been demonstrated by systematic excavation of four West Saxon boroughs (at Wareham, Cricklade, Lydford and Wallingford) that "in every case the rampart associated by the excavators with the borough of the Alfredian period was the primary defence on the site" (N.P. Brooks The Development of Military Obligations in Eighth and Ninth Century England). We know that such defences were not constructed by the occasional Danish occupiers, thanks to surviving transcripts of the formidable 11th Century administrative manuscript known as the Burghal Hidage, dated within 20 years of Alfred's death-it may well date to Alfred's reign, and it almost certainly reflects Alfredian policy. This documents the established position of these four burhs, among many others, as permanently garrisoned and maintained fortress-towns. By comparing town plans of Wallingford and Wareham with that of Winchester, one can see 'that they were laid out in the same scheme' (P. Wormald in J. Campbell, ed., The Anglo-Saxons). This supports the proposition that these newly established burhs were planned as centers of habitation and trade as well as a place of safety in moments of immediate danger.<br>
<br>
The 'Burghal Hidage' sets out the obligations for the upkeep and defense of these towns; in this way, the English population and its wealth was drawn into towns where it was not only safer from Viking soldiers, but also taxable by the King.<br>
<br>
Alfred is thus credited with a significant degree of civil re-organization, especially in the districts ravaged by the Danes. Even if one rejects the thesis crediting the 'Burghal Hidage' to Alfred, what is undeniable is that, in the parts of Mercia acquired by Alfred from the Vikings, the shire system seems now to have been introduced for the first time. This is at least one grain of truth in the legend that Alfred was the inventor of shires, hundreds and tithings. The finances also needed attention; but the subject is obscure, and we cannot accept Asser's description of Alfred's appropriation of his revenue as more than an ideal sketch. Alfred's care for the administration of justice is testified both by history and legend; and the title "protector of the poor" was his by unquestioned right. Of the action of the Witangemot we do not hear very much under Alfred. That he was anxious to respect its rights is conclusively proved, but both the circumstances of the time and the character of the king would tend to throw more power into his hands. The legislation of Alfred probably belongs to the later part of the reign, after the pressure of the Danes had relaxed.<br>
<br>
Foreign relations<br>
Asser speaks grandiosely of Alfred's relations with foreign powers, but little definite information is available. He certainly corresponded with Elias III, the patriarch of Jerusalem, and probably sent a mission to India. Embassies to Rome conveying the English alms to the Pope were fairly frequent; while Alfred's interest in foreign countries is shown by the insertions which he made in his translation of Orosius.<br>
<br>
Around 890 Wulfstan of Haithabu undertook a journey from Haithabu on Jutland along the Baltic Sea to the Prussian trading town Truso. Wulfstan reported details of his trip to Alfred the Great.<br>
<br>
His relations to the Celtic princes in the southern half of the island are clearer. Comparatively early in his reign the Welsh princes, owing to the pressure on them of North Wales and Mercia, commended themselves to Alfred. Later in the reign the North Welsh followed their example, and the latter co-operated with the English in the campaign of 893 (or 894). That Alfred sent alms to Irish as well as to European monasteries may be taken on Asser's authority; the visit of the three pilgrim "Scots" (i.e., Irish) to Alfred in 891 is undoubtedly authentic; the story that he himself in his childhood was sent to Ireland to be healed by St. Modwenna, though mythical, may show Alfred's interest in that island.<br>
<br>
Christianity and literature<br>
The history of the church under Alfred is most obscure. The Danish inroads had told heavily upon it; the monasteries had been special points of attack, and though Alfred founded two or three monasteries and imported foreign monks, there was no general revival of monasticism under him.<br>
<br>
To the ruin of learning and education wrought by the Danes, and the practical extinction of the knowledge of Latin even among the clergy, the preface to Alfred's translation into Old English of Pope Gregory's Pastoral Care bears eloquent witness. It was to remedy these evils that he established a court school, after the example of Charlemagne; for this he imported scholars like Grimbald and John the Saxon from Europe and Asser from South Wales; for this, above all, he put himself to school, and made the series of translations for the instruction of his clergy and people, most of which yet survive. These belong unquestionably to the latter of his reign, likely to the last four years, during which the chronicles are almost silent.<br>
<br>
Apart from the lost Handboc or Encheiridion, which seems to have been merely a commonplace-book kept by the king, the earliest work to be translated was the Dialogues of Gregory, a book greatly popular in the Middle Ages. In this case the translation was made by Alfred's great friend Werferth, Bishop of Worcester, the king merely furnishing a foreword. The next work to be undertaken was Gregory's Pastoral Care, especially for the good of the parish clergy. In this Alfred keeps very close to his original; but the introduction which he prefixed to it is one of the most interesting documents of the reign, or indeed of English history. The next two works taken in hand were historical, the Universal History of Orosius and Bede's Ecclesiastical History of the English People. The priority should likely be given to the Orosius, but the point has been much debated. In the Orosius, by omissions and additions, Alfred so remodels his original as to produce an almost new work; in the Bede the author's text is closely stuck to, no additions being made, though most of the documents and some other less interesting matters are omitted. Of late years doubts have been raised as to Alfred's authorship of the Bede translation. But the sceptics cannot be regarded as having proved their point.<br>
<br>
We come now to what is in many ways the most interesting of Alfred's works, his translation of The Consolation of Philosophy of Boethius, the most popular philosophical handbook of the middle ages. Here again Alfred deals very freely with his original and though the late Dr. G. Schepss showed that many of the additions to the text are to be traced not to Alfred himself, but to the glosses and commentaries which he used, still there is much in the work which is solely Alfred's and highly characteristic of his genius. It is in the Boethius that the oft-quoted sentence occurs: "My will was to live worthily as long as I lived, and after my life to leave to them that should come after, my memory in good works." The book has come down to us in two manuscripts only. In one of these the poems with which the original is interspersed are rendered into prose, in the other into alliterating verse. The authorship of the latter has been much disputed; but likely they also are by Alfred. Of the authenticity of the work as a whole there has never been any doubt.<br>
<br>
The last of Alfred's works is one to which he gave the name Blostman, i.e., "Blooms" or Anthology. The first half is based mainly on the Soliloquies of St Augustine of Hippo, the remainder is drawn from various sources, and contains much that is Alfred's own and highly characteristic of him. The last words of it may be quoted; they form a fitting epitaph for the noblest of English kings. "Therefore he seems to me a very foolish man, and truly wretched, who will not increase his understanding while he is in the world, and ever wish and long to reach that endless life where all shall be made clear."<br>
<br>
Beside these works of Alfred's, the Saxon Chronicle almost certainly, and a Saxon Martyrology, of which fragments only exist, probably owe their inspiration to him. A prose version of the first fifty Psalms has been attributed to him; and the attribution, though not proved, is perfectly possible. Additionally, Alfred appears as a character in The Owl and the Nightingale, where his wisdom and skill with proverbs is attested. Additionally, The Proverbs of Alfred, which exists for us in a 13th century manuscript, contain sayings that very likely have their origins partly with the king. In honor of Alfred, the University of Liverpool now has a King Alfred Chair of English Literature.<br>
<br>
Famous historical fiction author Bernard Cornwell has recently started a retelling saga about Alfred's life.<br>
<br>
Death<br>
Alfred died on 26 October 899, though the year is uncertain.  How he died is unknown.<br>
</p>
Ceawlin of WESSEX
<p>
<a name ="I005186"><b>[I005186]</b></a><br />
From Wikipedia<br>
<br>
Ceawlin of Wessex (also spelled "Ceaulin" or "Caelin") is recorded in the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle as being king of the West Saxons, or Wessex from 560 to 591, and named by Bede in his Historia Ecclesiastica Gentis Anglorum as the second Bretwalda. The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle records his death as occurring in 593.<br>
<br>
Recent scholars have speculated over the relationship of Ceawlin with the Saxon tribe called the Gewissae, whom Bede located in the upper Thames region near Dorchester-on-Thames. He may have been a member of their ruling dynasty; the surviving genealogies of the Wessex royal line all have contradictions, and scholars suspect that these have been altered to support the claims of descent by later rulers.<br>
<br>
A fact that has also drawn much comment is the gap of a generation or two between the first Bretwalda Ælle and Ceawlin. This has been cited as supporting Gildas' claim that for over 40 years after the battle of Mons Badonicus the British lived in peace and were secure from major predations from the Anglo Saxon invaders. And if we ignore the raids of Ceredic and his sons in the areas of present-day southern Hampshire and Wiltshire, and acknowledge that the Angles in Bernicia were confined to a single stronghold by the British, this makes sense.<br>
<br>
Our principal source for the events of his life are the eight entries from the Anglo Saxon Chronicle from 556 to 593. Although the Chronicle itself dates from the final decade of the ninth century, these entries appear to record the skeleton of an older saga. A discussion of these entries follows.<br>
<br>
556<br>
In this year, Cynric and Ceawlin fought against the British at Beranburh.<br>
<br>
This is Ceawlin's first appearance in the Chronicle. Cynric was the current king of the West Saxons, and Ceawlin apparently was the junior member in this action. Beranburh is identified with Barbury Camp in the Marlborough Downs, overlooking the valley of Swindon.<br>
<br>
560<br>
In this year, Ceawlin succeeded to the kingdom of the West Saxons.<br>
<br>
The Chronicle has no mention of Cynric's death; there is no sign whether Ceawlin's actions in 556 allow him to seize the primacy of the West Saxons, or if the chronicler missed an entry.<br>
<br>
568<br>
In this year, Ceawlin and Cutha fought against Æthelbert, sending him in flight to Kent, and two aldermen were slain in Wibbandun, Oslaf and Cnebban.<br>
<br>
Æthelbert here is the Æthelbert of Kent who welcomed the missionary Augustine to Britain. While this entry is consistent with the Chronicle's claim that Æthelbert ruled Kent from 560, the contemporary account of Gregory of Tours indicates that he more likely became king closer to 590. This discrepancy suggests that the Chronicler either modified his source, or that his source did not reflect the original facts here; or that Gregory was mistaken.<br>
<br>
In any case, the point of this entry was to show that Ceawlin was superior in arms to the better known Æthelbert.<br>
<br>
Since at least as early as Charles Plummer' edition of the Chronicle, it has been observed that this is the first recorded battle between the Anglo Saxon tribes.<br>
<br>
Wibbandun up to the early twentieth century was identified with Wimbledon, London, but research in the formation of that place name did not support that identification. Currently, scholarly opinion holds that it is located somewhere south of the Thames, west of the Kent border. It is now considered that the site of the battle was Whitmoor Common, Worplesdon, north of Guildford.<br>
<br>
Nothing more is known of the aldermen Oslaf and Cnebban.<br>
<br>
571<br>
In this year, Cuthwulf fought against the British Welsh at Bedcanford and took 4 towns, Lygeanburg, Aegelesburg, Baenesington and Egonesham, and in the same year he passed on.<br>
<br>
So the Parker manuscript, as well as two others; the Laud manuscript names the West Saxon leader "Cutha". The term "British Welsh" is an attempt to translate the Anglo-Saxon "Bretwalas", which appears in the Chronicle only nine times, including this entry: up to the entry for about year 600, the Chronicler calls the native British inhabitants "Brettas" or British -- except for his entries concerning Aelle -- and "Wealas" or Welsh afterwards<br>
<br>
Bedcanford up to the early twentieth century was identified with Bedford, but research in the formation of that place name does not support that identification. The four towns, respectively, are the modern Limbury, Aylesbury, Benson, and Eynsham -- all located in the Chiltern Hills. Archeological evidence points to the fact that there was an enclave of British communities around London and Verulamium into the sixth century. This area may be remembered as the Chilternsaete listed in the Tribal Hidage, who were taxed at a valuation of 4000 hides.<br>
<br>
577<br>
In this year, Cuthwine and Ceawlin fought against the British, and they killed 3 kings Coinmail, Condidan, and Farinmail in the place that is called Deorham. And they captured 3 strongholds, Gloucester, Cirencester and Bathcester.<br>
<br>
This is the Battle of Deorham. Much has been made that with this battle the Cornish Celts were separated from the Welsh; in actual fact, the Celtic peoples living in those parts of Britain could still travel by land with little significant barrier between them for many more years. The Historia Britonum records one Glast as coming from Litchfield south to found Glastonbury about the time the Mercians conquered part of their kingdom to create Shropshire. More important is the fact that the Anglo-Saxon invaders could now sweep into the Severn valley (as Ceawlin is said to have done several years later) and plunder the inhabitants, while the Celts to the west no longer could as easily penetrate the Cotswolds scarp between Gloucester and Cirencester to return the visit.<br>
<br>
Deorham has been identified as Dyrham, a village some eight miles north of Bath, and five miles west of the Fosse Way, the Roman road between Bath and Cirencester.<br>
<br>
It is not clear if the three kings should be matched with one "stronghold" each, or perhaps they were relatives who shared rule over all three. The modern Welsh form of these kings names is Cynvael, Cynddylan, and Ffernvael.<br>
<br>
584<br>
In this year, Ceawlin and Cutha fought against the British in the place that is named Fethanleag and Cutha was slain. And Ceawlin took many towns and robbed countless bodies, and in anger he returned to his lands.<br>
<br>
Cutha again appears a final time, thirteen years after his possible death at Bedcanford. It is not clear if the chronicler made a confusion of his source materials, or if Cutha and Cuthwine are different individuals. However the phrase "in anger he returned to his lands" appears to be a line from saga.<br>
<br>
This event has been interpreted as a sweeping raid up the Severn valley to the location of Fethanleag. Plummer identifies this place name with Faddiley in Cheshire; more recent scholarly research identifies this with Stoke Lyne.<br>
<br>
592<br>
In this year, there was a great slaughter at Woddesbeorg, and Ceawlin was driven out.<br>
<br>
(So the Parker manuscript; the Laud manuscript reads "In this year Gregorius succeeded to the papacy in Rome, and there a great slaughter happened in Britain this year at Wodnesbeorg, and Ceawlin was driven out.")<br>
<br>
Woddesbeorg/Wodnesbeorg is a rare pagan Anglo-Saxon place name. It is identified with the present day Alton Priors seven miles east of Devizes.<br>
<br>
The chronicler shows that this was a decisive defeat for Ceawlin by dating it only a year prior to his death; all of his other entries concerning Ceawlin are separated by five to seven years. Obviously this exile would also demonstrate that his claim to the title of Bretwalda ended at the same time.<br>
<br>
Of unknown value is William of Malmesbury's comment that this slaughter at Woddensbeorg was the result of "the Angles and the British conspiring together". We have no other evidence for the identity of Ceawlin's adversary, only the suspicion that his successor Ceolwulf, son of his associate Cutha, might have been involved -- but if that is the case, it is puzzling that would he need until 597 to succeed to the kingship of the West Saxons.<br>
<br>
593<br>
In this year, Ceawlin, Cuichelm and Crida perished, and Æthelfrith succeeded to the kingdom in Northumbria.<br>
<br>
By dating Ceawlin's death to the same year Æthelfrith became king of Northumbria, the Chronicler betrays his assumption that the various kings of this early period followed closely upon each other. While the entry of 568 suggests that Ceawlin and Ethelbert were contemporaries, this entry should not be taken as proof that Ceawlin died at the same time Æthelfrith became king.<br>
<br>
One feature of Ceawlin's activities, similar to other early Anglo-Saxon kings, is that he is frequently mentioned in the company of other individuals. This suggests that although he was renowned as a warrior, his own following was too small for his to effectively wage war by himself, and that he depended on the support of other nobles or kings of the West Saxons. In other words, there was no centralized kingdom of Wessex at this time, instead Wessex was properly a federation of varying closeness of petty rulers.<br>
</p>
Cedric of WESSEX
<p>
<a name ="I005189"><b>[I005189]</b></a><br />
From Wikipedia<br>
<br>
Cerdic of Wessex (c. 467-534), the Patriarch of the Blood Royal of Saxony, was an early King of Wessex (519-534). He is first mentioned in the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle when he landed in Hampshire in 495 and in 519 gained a great victory at Charford, "but Hengest and Adelle's men had touched hardly more than the coast, and the true conquest of Southern Britain was reserved for a fresh band of Saxons, a tribe known as the Gewissas, who landed under Cerdic and his son Cynric on the shores of the Southampton Water, and pushed in 495 to the great Downs of Gwent where Winchester offered so rich a prize. Nowhere was the strife fiercer than here; and it was not till 519 that a decisive victory at Charford ended the struggle for the "Gwent" and set the crown of the West-Saxons on the head of Cerdic." The West Saxons also fought a British king named Natanleod in Wiltshire and slew him. Under his leadership the West Saxons also advanced into Dorset and Somerset. Cerdic was defeated at Mount Badon in Dorsetshire in 520. The conquest of the Isle of Wight is also mentioned among his campaigns, and it was later given to his nephews, Stuf and Wihtgar (who brought many other Saxons with them).<br>
<br>
In 530 he and his son gradually conquered the country from Sussex to the River Avon in Hampshire; they also passed the Thames and subdued the country as far as Bedford. They were called the West Saxons and the Kingdom of Cerdic was named Wessex. Cerdic died in 534 and was succeeded by his son Cynric.<br>
<br>
Curiously, the name Cerdic is thought to be British-a form of the name Ceretic-rather than Germanic in origin. One explanation for this is the possibility that Cerdic's mother was British and that he was given a name used by his mother's people; if so, this would provide evidence for a degree of mixing, both cultural and biological, between the invaders and the native British.<br>
</p>
Cynric of WESSEX
<p>
<a name ="I005187"><b>[I005187]</b></a><br />
Cynric of Wessex ruled as king of Wessex from 534 to 560. He was either the son or grandson of Cerdic. Among the few statements made about his life were that he captured Searobyrig or Old Sarum, near Salisbury, in 552, and that in 556 he and his son Ceawlin won a battle against the Britons at Beranburh, now identified as Barbury Camp.<br>
<br>
In the 2004 film King Arthur, Cerdic and Cynric were depicted as Saxon invaders, and were killed, respectively, by Arthur and Lancelot and the Battle of Badon Hill (Mons Badonicus).<br>
</p>
Edward I of WESSEX
<p>
<a name ="I005169"><b>[I005169]</b></a><br />
Edward I is sometimes referred to as "the English Justinian" He had a love for justice, honor, and order in his affairs. At one point in his reign, he faced a declaration of war with France and rebellions from the Welsh and Scots. He decided that the only way to overcome his difficulties would be to solicit the support of his people. In 1295 he called together a parliament consisting of representatives of the nobility, the church, and the common people. This "Model Parliament" marked the beginning of parliamentary government in England, a system that has continued to the present day. "What touches all," Edward proclaimed, "should be approved by all, and it is also clear that common dangers should be met by measures agreed upon in common." He restricted the power of the king by accepting the rule that taxes could not be levied or laws made except by the consent of parliament.<br>
<br>

<br>
Edward the Elder (871? - July 17, 924) was King of England (899 - 924). He was the son of Alfred the Great and became King of Wessex upon his father's death in 899.<br>
<br>
Edward arguably exceeded Alfred's military achievements, restoring the Danelaw to Saxon rule and reigning in Mercia from 918, after the death of his sister, Ethelfleda. He spent his early reign fighting his cousin Aethelwald, son of Ethelred I. He had about eighteen children from his three marriages, and may have had an illegitimate child, too. He died in 924 and was buried at Winchester. Edmund I, or Edmund the Deed-Doer (921-May 26, 946) who was King of England from 939 was a son of Edward the Elder, and a half-brother to Athelstan.  Athelstan died on October 27, 939, and Edmund succeeded him as King.<br>
<br>
His daughter, Eadgifu married King Charles III of France. Her son became King Louis IV of France.<br>
</p>
Egbert of WESSEX
<p>
<a name ="I005176"><b>[I005176]</b></a><br />
From Wikipedia<br>
<br>
Egbert (also Ecgberht or Ecgbert) (c. 770- July 839) was King of Wessex from 802 until his death. Under Egbert, Wessex rose to become the most powerful of the Anglo-Saxon kingdoms, overthrowing the supremacy of Mercia.<br>
<br>
A somewhat difficult question has arisen as to the parentage of Egbert. Under the year 825, the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle states that in his eastern conquests Egbert recovered what had been the rightful property of his kin. The father of Egbert was called Ealhmund, and we find an Ealhmund, king in Kent, mentioned in a charter dated 784, who is identified with Egbert's father in a late addition to the Chronicle under the date 784. It is possible, however, that the Chronicle in 825 refers to some claim through Ine of Wessex from whose brother Ingeld Egbert was descended.<br>
<br>
After the murder of King Cynewulf in 786, Egbert may have contested the succession, but the throne went to Beorhtric, an ally of Offa of Mercia. Starting probably in 789, Egbert went into exile after being expelled by Offa and Beorhtric. He spent this exile with the Franks on the continent, and although it is said to have lasted three years, some historians have suggested that this period may have actually lasted thirteen years (789-802), as this would account for Egbert's whereabouts during the whole period preceding Beorhtric's death.<br>
<br>
Beorhtric ruled subject to the Mercian kings (Offa and, from 796, Coenwulf), and Egbert probably sought greater independence for Wessex. He was acknowledged as king by the West Saxons following Beorhtric's death in 802, but on the same day as his accession to the throne, Ælthelmund, earl of the Hwicce, led a raid into Wessex. Ælthelmund was defeated and killed by Weoxtan, earl of Wiltshire, who also lost his life in the battle.<br>
<br>
In 815 Egbert ravaged the whole of the territories of the West Welsh, which probably at this time did not include much more than Cornwall; it is probably from his reign that Cornwall can be considered subject to Wessex. The next important occurrence in the reign was the defeat of Beornwulf of Mercia at a place called Ellandun in 825. After this victory, Kent, Surrey, Sussex and Essex submitted to Wessex; while the East Anglians, who rose against Mercian rule and slew Beornwulf shortly afterwards, acknowledged Egbert as overlord. In 829 the king conquered Mercia, and Northumbria accepted him as overlord after refusing to fight his forces at Dore (now a suburb of Sheffield). In 830 he led a successful expedition against the Welsh, and it was in the same year that Mercia regained its independence under Wiglaf, although it is uncertain whether this was achieved through a rebellion or was the result of a grant by Egbert to Wiglaf. In 836 Egbert was defeated by the Danes, but in 838 he won a battle against them and their allies the West Welsh at Hingston Down in Cornwall.<br>
<br>
Egbert married Redburga, a Frankish princess (possibly a sister-in-law of the emperor Charlemagne), and had two sons and a daughter. Egbert died in about 839, and was buried at Winchester. He was succeeded by his son, King Ethelwulf of Wessex.<br>
