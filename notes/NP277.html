Cecile Louise JOHNSON
<p>
<a name ="I074817"><b>[I074817]</b></a><br />
Cecile Louise (Johnson) Craig was born in Lake Victor, Texas on January 9, 1914. She moved to Uvalde at the age of 5 with her grandparents, Mr. and Mrs. W.R. Adams, and her parents, Mr. and Mrs. G. W. Johnson (George and Myra). Her parents established the Johnson General Merchandise Store at the corner of Park and Commerce streets, and she often helped her parents in the store as she grew up. After graduating from Uvalde High School in 1930, she left in June of that year for Belton, Texas, where she attended Baylor College and worked as the college registrarʼs secretary. She later transferred to Southwest Texas State University in San Marcos, receiving an undergraduate degree in English and business administration from that university in 1934. Always recognizing the value of education, she continued her studies, doing graduate-level work in English at the University of Texas in Austin. Years later, while working full-time as a teacher and rearing a family, she earned her masterʼs degree from Our Lady of the Lake University in San Antonio, majoring in educational psychology and library science. She began her teaching career in a one-room schoolhouse in Blewett, Texas. From 1936-1941, she taught at West Main School in Uvalde. During World War II, she worked as a surgeonʼs secretary at Garner Field Air Base from 1941-1943. On August 28, 1943, at the base chapel in Stuttgart, Arkansas, she married James Ellis Craig of Marshallville, Georgia. James was a captain in the U.S. Army Air Corps and a B-17 pilot. During the early years of their marriage, the couple lived in five different states before returning to Uvalde to settle down after Captain Craig was injured in the war and left military service. For more than 30 years, Cecile had a career as an educator, serving as both a classroom teacher and a librarian. She taught in eight different schools in Florida and Texas and taught almost as many subjects, providing instruction for students in English, Spanish, history, math, and chemistry before becoming a librarian. She served as a librarian at the junior high school before being asked to establish and maintain the first libraries at Benson and Robb elementary schools. After leaving the public schools, she became assistant librarian at Southwest Texas Junior College. During that time, she also occasionally taught night courses in American and British literature for SWTJC and Sul Ross. Following her retirement from the junior college in 1979, she served as head librarian for the El Progreso and county libraries before fully retiring in 1983. In addition to her career in education, Cecile was a partner with her husband in two businesses - the Johnson-Craig Furniture Company in North Uvalde and Norge Fabricare on Main Street. Cecile was a member of the American Association of University Women; Delta Kappa Gamma, in which she served a term as president; the Retired Teachers Association; and the First Baptist Church. Over the years, she helped shape the lives of hundreds of students in elementary school, junior high, and college. Many former students have approached her over the years to tell her how much her affection and encouragement meant to them. Always putting others before herself, she lived a life of love and service. She walked in faith with the Lord and valued family, friends, and the simple life. She was the consummate mother, always looking for ways to help others in need in addition to caring for her immediate family. Her life was based on charity and compassion. She was loved, admired, respected, and cherished by her family. In losing her, her family has lost their greatest treasure. She was preceded in death by her parents; her brother, William Haul Johnson; her sister, Anne Johnson Graves; her husband; and three sons-in-law: Joe Henderson, Larry Lewis, and Andrew Sichi. She is survived by her daughters, Dianne Craig of Canyon Lake and Janie Morrison (Wade) of San Antonio; granddaughter, Jean Brannum (Chris Fishlock-Lomax) of Uvalde; great-grandson, Eddie Brannum (Kim Eagle) of Uvalde; niece Patti Dunlap of Sequim, Washington; niece Jan Pollard of San Antonio; nephew, Tom Graves and family of Anchorage, Alaska; and cousins, Pat and Paul Rogers of Montell, along with other much-loved relatives. She is also survived by members of her husbandʼs family, Mr. John Mercer and family of Atlanta, Georgia, and Mr. and Mrs. Walter Cooper, Jr., and family of Hurst.<br>

He moved to Canada in 1926 - first to Tappen, B.C. then Glacier and finally settling in Canoe B.C. in 1929. Times were hard during the depression and they lived on a small farm and everyone helped with the chores. In the winter they wore homemade wool socks and went barefoot in the summer. Their school lunch was usually a lard sandwich. He finished school in 1933 and was lucky to get a job on the log boom on Shuswap Lake. Later, with his father and brothers they went horse logging up the lake, cutting poles. In 1936 he bought his first car - a 1926 Model T Ford pickup truck for $35.00.

In 1979 he retired at the age of 60, He was a handy man - carpenter, gun smith, made small row boats and all car repairs. He showed his sons and grandsons and grandson in-law how to hunt and fish and showed his grandson, David how to make a gun and a boat. He loved the outdoors - hunting, fishing, picking berries and wildflowers, getting firewood and mountain climbing. He climbed Hog Ranch Mountain with his sons a few times and got a few mountain goat. At age 70 he climbed with his grandson, David. When he was 80 he hired a helicopter with his son Lyle and made his last trip to the top of Hog Ranch Mountain.
