<h2>Notes</h2>
Godred III CROVAN
<p>
<a name ="I010558"><b>[I010558]</b></a><br />
The ancestry of Godred Crovan (d. 1095), king of Dublin and Man, is not well documented, and there are differing opinions regarding his parentage and immediate ancestors. Rather than try to give a definitive solution to the problem, the basic evidence will be outlined, and several possible alternatives will be given, along with their strengths and weaknesses. Since the basic raw data is itself somewhat contradictory, none of the suggested alternatives will fit all of the primary evidence.<br>
<br>
The basic raw data is as follows. First, the Annals of Tigernach [AT] for the year 1091 refer to him as the son of the son of Harald ["Goffraidh mac Maic Arailt, rı́ Atha Cliath."]. Then, there is the Chronicle of the Kings of Man [CRM], which states that Godred was the son of Harald the Black of "Ysland" (Iceland), without further identifying this Harald. Finally, there is the Welsh collection of Norse pedigrees in "Achau Brenhinoedd a Thywysogion Cymru" [ABT, in EWGT, pp. 95-110], which includes a genealogy of the kings of Man, as follows:<br>
<br>
ABT.6c: Rhanallt m. Gwythryg m. Afloyd m. Gwrthryt mearch m. Harallt ddu m. Ifor gamle m. Afloyd m. Swtrig.<br>
<br>
Changing the names from these Welsh forms to the more familiar English forms gives:<br>
<br>
Reginald [king of Man, d. 14 Feb 1229], son of<br>
Godred [king of Man, d. 10 Nov 1187], son of<br>
Olaf [king of Man, d. 29 June 1153], son of<br>
Godred [Crovan, king of Dublin and Man, d. 1095], son of<br>
Harald ddu [i.e., the Black], son of<br>
Ivar gamle [i.e., the Old], son of<br>
Olaf [presumably Olaf Cuaran, king of Dublin and York], son of<br>
Sitric [d. 927]<br>
<br>
It may be that the above genealogy was composed during the reign of Reginald (d. 1229), since he is the latest person mentioned in the genealogy. There is no way of knowing whether copying mistakes were made between that time of composition and the surviving manuscripts.<br>
<br>
We now list several possibilities regarding the ancestry of Godred Crovan, along with the strengths and weaknesses of each possibility (some of which are valid for more than one case, and are therefore repeated). While there are other scenarios which could be listed, they would seem less likely than the ones given below.<br>
<br>
Possibility 1: The genealogy of ABT is to be accepted as it is.<br>
Strengths: It requires no emendation of the genealogy in ABT. It agrees with the Chronicle of the kings of Man in making Godred the son of Harald "the Black".<br>
Weaknesses: No son of Olaf Cuaran named Ivar is known from the Irish records. The generations are a bit long (but not drastically so). It disagrees with the Annals of Tigernach, which make Godred the grandson of a certain Harald.<br>
<br>
Possibility 2: In the process of copying the pedigree, a "Harald" was accidently omitted between Ivar and Olaf Cuaran, so that the pedigree should read Godred son of Harald the Black son of Ivar son of Harald son of Olaf [Cuaran].<br>
Strengths: Olaf Cuaran had a son named Harald, who in turn had a son named Ivar, both known from the Irish annals, so the agreement with the Irish annals would be excellent. It agrees with the Chronicle of the kings of Man in making Godred the son of Harald "the Black". The chronology fits better than Possibilities 1 and 3.<br>
Weaknesses: It requires an emendation of the pedigree in ABT. It disagrees with the Annals of Tigernach, which make Godred the grandson of a certain Harald.<br>
<br>
Possibility 3: In the process of copying the pedigree, Harald and Ivar were accidently switched, so that the pedigree should read Godred son of Ivar son of Harald son of Olaf [Cuaran].<br>
Strengths: Olaf Cuaran had a son named Harald, who in turn had a son named Ivar, both known from the Irish annals, so the agreement with the Irish annals would be excellent. It agrees with the Annals of Tigernach, which call Godred the grandson of a certain Harald.<br>
Weaknesses: It requires an emendation of the pedigree in ABT. The generations are a bit long (but not drastically so). It disagrees the the Chronicle of the kings of Man, which make Godred the son of Harald the Black.<br>
<br>
Possibility 4: The pedigree in ABT is wrong, and Godred was not a descendant of Olaf Cuaran, but was instead descended somehow from the kings of the Isles who ruled in the late tenth and early eleventh centuries.<br>
Strengths: It would explain Godred's claim to the kingship of Man. The known names used by the early dynasty of the kings of the Isles were Guthfrith (i.e., Godred), Harald, Lagman, Olaf, and Rognvald, which were exactly the names which were common in the family of Godred Crovan (including the rare name Lagman), so this possiblity has some onomastic support.<br>
Weakness: It requires abandoning the manuscript genealogy of ABT, so there is no direct supporting evidence. The onomastic argument is mitigated somewhat by the fact that the names Guthfrith, Harald, Olaf, and Rognvald were all common among the Hiberno-Norse in general, so that only the rare name Lagman carries significant weight in the onomastic argument.<br>
<br>
Before I was aware of the genealogy in ABT, I favored possibility 4. Now that I know about the ABT genealogy, I think Possibility 2 is the most likely one. However, I think that none of the four possibilities can be ruled out, given the currently known evidence.<br>

MEGAN CROWLEY'S THIRD ATTEMPT AT SUICIDE WAS SUCCESSFUL ON FEB. 21. THE BRIGHT, PRETTY, POPULAR 15-YEAR-OLD HUNG HERSELF IN THE BASEMENT OF HER HOME WHILE THE REST OF HER FAMILY WAS UPSTAIRS.<br>
"There wasn't anything unusual about that evening," says her mother Susan Crowley. "We have a computer in the basement. She loved that computer. It was not unusual for her to do her homework there late at night. I went downstairs to see when she was coming to bed-that's when I discovered her."<br>
A freshman and a cheerleader at West High School, Megan suffered from severe depression for almost three years. "It took us a while to figure out the difference between normal adolescent growing pains and the fact that she was severely clinically depressed," Susan Crowley said.<br>
"She was very popular. She was beautiful. She was well-loved and well-respected. None of that could get through this overwhelming sense of worthlessness that she felt as a result of her depression."<br>
Megan's death was one of three adolescent suicides in Dane County in the first six months of this year. That's a lot in a short period of time, and it's worrying parents and professionals in the community.<br>

Upon high school graduation he and 5 of his buddies headed off to seek their fortune in San Francisco. All but Jerry returned to Des Moines.

Halfway through he was drafted into the Army and was based in Alaska. Upon returning to California he received his degree and was hired by an architecture firm in San Francisco. When he was offered a transfer to Lake Tahoe, being an avid skier, he jumped at the opportunity. The move happened just prior to a recession and he spent a lot of his time driving a snow removal truck to support his wife and new daughter.<br>
Jerry eventually moved to Reno and opened his own business. He designed many beautiful homes, businesses and health care facilities in Northern Nevada and California. In addition he was constantly creating or inventing and ideas came to him at a rapid rate.<br>
In 1983 he met the woman he would spend the next wonderful 33 years. In 1993 they opened The Continuum Intergenerational Rehabilitation Facility that Jerry designed and redesigned in 2005. He received his contractor's license and directed the Mod Squad- a home safety and modification program. In addition to installing safety equipment he was always creating new devices or clever modifications.<br>
He loved to help others, especially those individuals who were disabled as well as their caregivers. He was always kind and gracious and expressed gratitude for all that he received. He was truly a humanitarian.<br>
He leaves behind, his life partner, Diane Ross, daughter Kelly Scott, granddaughter Karsen Scott, brother David Ketchum and his adopted children, JoAnn, Mark, Kathy, Judy, grandchildren Karlie, Stephen, Terralyn and Adam, and great grandson, Noah, and many friends.<br>
Often Jerry, with his ever-positive attitude, would say that if he were to die this very day, he could not have lived a more wonderful life. How blessed we are for having known this special person.<br>
A celebration of Jerry's life will be held on January 16th at the Hidden Valley Country Club from 1:30 to 3:30.<br>

Some of us spend our entire lives earning our wings. Others are so perfect they have their wings at birth. Our son, Ronald James Drozd IV, was one of those perfect souls. In his few short hours on earth, RJ touched countless lives and left his imprint on our hearts.<br>
RJ came into this world on July 7, 2013, a tiny but perfect being. He was held, loved and baptized before being called to heaven. He will be forever missed by his parents, Ronald (Rocky) Drozd III and Lynn Laszewski, and his big sister, Annya, all of whom loved him beyond measure. <br>
Also carrying him forever in their hearts are RJ's grandparents, Jerri (Todd) Mosher, Appleton; Joann (Peter) Mariahazy, Menasha; and Ronald (Pam) Drozd Jr., Oak Forest, Il; great-grandparents Arcelia Crupi, Little Chute; Ronald and Mariann Drozd Sr., Crestwood, Il; and Carleton (Cully) Selig, Appleton. <br>
RJ's family also includes aunts and uncles: Jeff Laszewski, Andrea Selig and Stephen (Kelly) Mariahazy, all of Appleton; and Nicole Drozd, Blue Island, Il; cousins, Lyla and Evalyn Mariahazy, Appleton. <br>
Preceding RJ in death were his maternal great-grandparents, Paul and Patricia Fancher.<br>
We will honor RJ in a memorial service at 1:00 PM Saturday, July 20, 2013, at Wichmann Funeral Home Tri-County Chapel, 3212 S Oneida St., Menasha WI. Friends may call at the funeral home beginning at noon. In lieu of flowers, a memorial fund has been established. <br>
Those we have held in our arms for a little while, we hold in our hearts forever.<br>
