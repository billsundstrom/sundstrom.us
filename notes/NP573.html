Everyone, one who knew Carla, knew that her cooking was her comfort.<br>
Carla also loved her cats, there was many times she would be snuggled up in her chair with her cats curled up in her lap reading a book. The cats and her enjoying the love and attention they all shared between them. There was not a day that did not go by that the cats were not surrounding her returning the love she provided for them.<br>
Carla was very active in her family. She enjoyed keeping the family up to date and stayed connected. She always made time to talk to anyone that had a problem or just new news to share. One could say she loved to help others and never complained. Carla was happy with a very simple life, she was a warm, loving, humble woman to share your most intimate thoughts. In return she would offer her loving ear and soothing words of advice only if asked.<br>
Carla was loved unconditionally by all who knew her. Her words of wisdom, advice, support and loving touch will be deeply missed by all that she touched in this world. May she rest peacefully knowing she will live forever in our thoughts, prayers and most of all, our hearts.<br>
