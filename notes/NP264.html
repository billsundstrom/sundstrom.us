<a name ="I082039"><b>[I082039]</b></a><br />
Gregg Arendt Hunter passed away peacefully in his sleep on Sunday, November 23, 2008, in his Northbrook home. He was 88 years old. He is survived by his wife of 61 years Betty, his daughter Barbara, sons David and Bob, his late daughter Susan, and his four grandchildren, Chris Pettit, Jennifer Hunter , Mathew Hunter and Mason Hunter . And last but certainly not least, his beloved dog Mac, or, "Put-Put" known to neighbors and friends! Gregg was born in Chicago in 1919. He graduated from Lawrence University, then put himself through law school at Chicago-Kent College of Law. He began working at the Harris Trust & Savings Bank in 1941, where he his met his wife Betty. He "retired" in 1984 at the Harris, yet worked 15 years beyond that retirement. He served as Chairman of the Board of Highland Park Hospital from 1975 to 1979. He also served on the Board of Federal Sign and Signal Corporation. Gregg had a love and passion for mathematics and numbers. He was a brilliant man with an uncanny, photographic memory, coupled with grace, humility, and a down to earth sensibility. He had a sincere interest in everyone he met, and treated all people with respect and dignity. Gregg was also an avid reader, and had math books by his side at all times. He and his friends would "challenge" each other with complex mathematical problems; the more difficult the challenge, the better he liked it. Gregg was uniquely genuine as well as generous regarding his compassion for all animal kind and mankind. His memory shall live on through his family, friends and neighbors by the enormous, loving impact he had on all those around him. He profoundly touched everyone he met, and left us all a better person with a richer heart. Donations can be made to one of his favorite charities, Orphans of the Storm, located at 2200 Riverwoods Road, Deerfield, IL 60015.<br>

Joellan Lynn HUNTLEY
<p>
<a name ="I044519"><b>[I044519]</b></a><br />
On April 18, 1996 the plaintiff was a passenger in a motor vehicle driven by Andrew Larkin. As the vehicle travelled on highway 359 in Centreville, Nova Scotia, a dog crossed the road directly in front of it causing Mr. Larkin to swerve to avoid the dog. The vehicle veered off the road and collided head on with a power pole. Joellan Lynn Huntley, suffered a severe brain injury in addition to other permanent injuries. <br>
-----------------------------------<br>
HALIFAX - In what her mother calls a "Christmas miracle," a Nova Scotia woman who suffered a catastrophic brain injury in a 1996 car accident communicated one-on-one with her mother for the first time in 21 years.<br>
Louise Misner said her 37-year-old daughter Joellen Huntley used eye-motion cameras and software on an iPad to respond to a comment from Misner about her clothes.<br>
Huntley has been severely disabled since she was 15, unable to walk or talk and fed through a tube. She has always responded to family members' presence by making sounds, but was unable to communicate any thoughts.<br>
The breakthrough occurred during a Christmas Day visit at the Kings Regional Rehabilitation Centre in Waterville, N.S.<br>
"I said 'Joellen I like your new Christmas outfit you got on,'" Misner said in a telephone interview on Friday.<br>
Misner said her daughter then used the technology to find an icon for a short-sleeve shirt.<br>
"And then she said no, and went to a long-sleeve shirt because she was trying to tell me what she had on."<br>
Misner said her reaction was immediate to what had been a long hoped for personal communication.<br>
"Christmas miracle," she said. "It was God's way of telling me that she's finally achieved what she needed to since the accident."<br>
Huntley was thrown from a car that had swerved to avoid a dog that was running loose along a road in Centreville, N.S., on April 18, 1996. The accident claimed the life of her boyfriend and a young girl who was the sister of the driver.<br>
Huntley's family eventually won a $1 million insurance settlement as a result of the crash, but by 2014 they found themselves embroiled in a court battle with the province's Community Services Department, which sought to claw back the money for past and future care costs.<br>
An undisclosed out-of-court settlement was reached in April 2015, after Joellen's family argued they needed the money for care that included physiotherapy and special equipment that would add to her quality of life.<br>
Misner said the settlement money helped the family purchase the computer equipment she is now using with the help of a speech pathologist.<br>
"We had to go through two or three different screens until we found the right one for her and it's called Eyegaze. Her eyes focus on the icons to answer questions."<br>
Misner said one of Joellen's nurses told them she is "doing really well with it."<br>
"I knew she just needed time for technology to catch up with her," Misner said. "When God gives you a child, they are the most precious thing and you never give up on them and you always fight for them."<br>
The family has invited journalists to the rehab centre on Tuesday to "meet Joellen."<br>
