Refill BJORNSSON
<p>
<a name ="I007803"><b>[I007803]</b></a><br />
Refil was according to Hervarar saga a son of the Swedish king Björn Ironside and the brother of its next king Erik Björnsson. Refil was a great warlord and a sea-king.<br>
<br>
It was Refil's son Erik Refilsson who inherited the Swedish throne at Erik Björnsson's death, which suggests that Refil may not have been alive at the time.<br>
</p>
Siward BJORNSSON
<p>
<a name ="I006369"><b>[I006369]</b></a><br />
From Wikipedia<br>
<br>
Sigurd the Dane, also known as Siward, was an English nobleman in the Eleventh Century, and the Earl of Northumbria.<br>
<br>
Siward was a descendant of the Danish royal family, whose ancestors had arrived in England a few generations earlier as part of the Norse colonization of Britain. He was the hereditary ruler of Northumbria.<br>
<br>
He served as a general to Hardicanute and Edward the Confessor, and gained great reknown for his skills as a soldier. He was related to the Scottish royal family, and was either the uncle or the brother-in-law of Malcolm Canmore (one text erroneously calls him his grandfather). Following Macbeth's defeat of Malcolm's father King Duncan I in 1040, the infant Malcolm was sent to Northumbria to be guarded by Siward. In 1053, Edward the Confessor agreed to assist the now adult Malcolm in taking the throne of Scotland, and designated Siward as leader of the English army. Siward's first incursion met with limited success, capturing the fortress Dunsinane in 1054, but Macbeth was not decisively defeated until 1057 at Lumphanan. One of Siward's own sons, Osberne, was killed during the campaign in Scotland.<br>
<br>
Malcolm's son King David I would later marry Siward's granddaughter Matilda. Siward's descendants also included James I of England, although this was not known during James' time.<br>

Olof BJÖRNSSON
<p>
<a name ="I005573"><b>[I005573]</b></a><br />
From Wikipedia<br>
<br>
Olof Björnsson (ca 970 - 975), was a semi-legendary Swedish king, who according to Hervarar saga and the Styrbjarnar áttr Svı́akappa ruled together with his brother Eric the Victorious. He was the father of Styrbjörn Starke, and he died of poison during a meal. Instead of proclaiming his son Styrbjörn co-ruler, Eric proclaimed his own unborn child co-ruler on condition that it was a son. It was a son who became Olof of Sweden.<br>

Delbert Raymond BLACK
<p>
<a name ="I038262"><b>[I038262]</b></a><br />
Delbert Raymond Black, DMD of Pocasset, MA, passed away peacefully on Monday, May, 19 2014 at his daughter's home in Charlotte, NC. He was 92. He was the beloved husband of the late Phyllis Elizabeth Black, who passed in November 2010. Delbert was born in Newton, MA, the son of the late Raymond and Minnie (Hicks) Black. Delbert served in the United States Navy during WWII. He is survived by his sister Dorothy Annis of Foxborough and children, Charles Black of Plymouth, Richard Black of Norwood, and Diane Ducey of Charlotte, NC; and four grandchildren, Erin Stackhouse, Tim Ducey, Jennifer Lynn and Megan Ducey.<br>
Delbert was a Tufts University graduate and DMD of the Tufts Dental School. He married Phyllis E. Fosgate prior to entering the Navy in WWII and then started a dental practice in Cambridge after the war. They settled in Lexington, MA and raised three children. He had grown up in Newton but spent summers at Orr's Island, Maine, where he developed a passion for all activity associated with the ocean. It wasn't long before Del had a small boat at the Newton Yatch Club in the Charles River and started heading with the family towards Cape Cod, for summer vacations. In the mid 50's he bought land on Wing's Neck and built a summer cottage. Most of his next 40 years was growing a dental practice and a member of Rotary in Lexington, while raising a family there and summering at the Pocasset cottage. Ice skating, skiing, basketball, track, cheerleading and field hockey were the winter events while boating, swimming, sailing and fishing were the summer rituals. Spring and fall was a time for the family to maintain the homes and boats that provided so much fun in the summer. Friends and relatives were always around the summer home on weekends and vacations. Del was happiest, when on his boat "Black Magic", venturing off to Hadley's Harbor, Tarpaulin Cove, Cuttyhunk and other places showing friends the beautiful harbors, and islands surrounding Cape Cod or on a men's deep sea fishing trip for bluefish, tuna or white marlin. In later years many of the boat trips were with couples to the islands around the Cape where Phyllis and Del had some of their best times together boating as empty nesters.<br>
Delbert retired from the dental practice in the latter 80's and renovated the cottage to a year round home. They took many trips around the US; north and south, east and west, and Europe. In later years the trips were mainly to Charlotte, NC to see his daughter and grandchildren and Bonita Beach, Florida to escape the winter months. As a boy, he hunted the woods of Maine but now just enjoyed watching the wild life in its natural habitat. Whether it was beautiful finches at the feeder or humming birds competing, racoons nesting in the basement window well, deer eating plants, coyotes chasing winter game or feeding the foxes on his son's wedding day, he found it all so enchanting. In addition, Del loved his road trips to Vermont, New Hampshire and Maine and particularly through the South and Florida. His last few years were a quieter life, living with his wife, daughter and family in Charlotte and Lake Norman, NC.<br>
A funeral home service will be held 1:00 PM on Saturday, June 7th in the Chapman, Cole & Gleason Funeral Home, 584 West Falmouth Hwy (Route 28A) WEST FALMOUTH. Burial will be at 11:00 AM on Monday, June 9th in the VA National Cemetery, Bourne, MA. <br>
