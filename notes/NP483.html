Affectionately known as "Bud" by his family and friends, he was raised on a farm outside of Ulysses, attended the Worden one-room schoolhouse through eighth grade, and graduated from Ulysses High School. He enlisted in the Army during World War II, and served in both the Pacific and European theatres. He was in the Austrian mountains when the German Army surrendered. He then was assigned to the Army of the Occupation and guarded German Prisoners of War. He was home on leave before training for the invasion of Japan, when the Japanese surrendered. He was then assigned as a ship board medic with the Merchant Marines transporting wounded troops and POWs between various Asian Pacific ports. He was honorably discharged, and returned to Potter County, and according to him, the prettiest place in the world. <br>
He was a member of Mills Union Church and a charter member of Carl E. Hyde Post American Legion Post #963 in Ulysses. He worked hard all his life, most of the time at both a full time and part-time job to support his growing family. He retired from the Air Preheater after 25 years of service. In his spare time, he enjoyed spending time with his family, hunting and fishing, and growing a bountiful garden, including plenty of potatoes. He loved listening to country music and watching sports, including those in which his children and grandchildren participated. He liked to watch birds and take drives to look for wildlife and recyclables. He had a colorful way of turning a phrase, which the grandchildren fondly called "Budisms".<br>

Sarah SCOTT
<p>
<a name ="I060767"><b>[I060767]</b></a><br />
Died at Villa Ridge, Illinois, on the afternoon of Wednesday, May 9, at three o ºclock, Mrs. Sarah Scott Edson, wife of Judge Obed Edson, aged seventy-seven years, seven months, and three days.<br>
The married life of the deceased extended over a period of sixty-one years, the Pearl (sixtieth) wedding anniversary being celebrated a year ago last February.  She was born in Hampshire County, Massachusetts, and removed thence with her parents to Chautauqua County, New York, where she was married at an early age, she and her husband moving to Villa Ridge in 1834.  She had been a member of the Methodist Episcopal Church for forty years.  Her last sickness extended over a period of only eight days.  Before passing away she expressed her faith that she was going to a home of eternal happiness with her Savior, whom she had so long loved and served.  Her life was one of usefulness and unselfish devotion to her family, of Christian fortitude and patience under affliction.  She raised a large family of children, six of whom (three sons and three daughters) are now living, five of them being present at the bedside of their dying parent, the absent one (a daughter) residing at such a distance that she could not be notified of the impending affliction in time to be in attendance on the mournful occasion.  Her afflicted husband will sadly miss his life-long and devoted loved companion, and helpmeet; and her children, her grandchildren and great-grandchildren will ever cherish with deep affection the memory of the dear departed.  Her uncomplaining submission to the affliction of death, of which she has had an unusual share, and her self-sacrificing devotion to the welfare of her family and friends, have greatly endeared her to a large circle of acquaintances, who admired her for her ostentatious devotion to her duties as a wife, mother and neighbor, and loved her for her lifelong examplication of all the Christian virtues.<br>

Thomas Henry SCOTT
<p>
<a name ="I025173"><b>[I025173]</b></a><br />
After an illness of severe intensity and of a years duration, rest came Monday morning at 3: A.M., May 8th, 1944.<br>
Thomas Henry Scott was born March 17, 1904 to Thomas and Harriet Scott at Rockford, Minnesota.<br>
He joined the Baptist Church at Anoka when he was about twenty years of age. May 29th, 1929 he was united in Holy Wedlock with Marguerite Cook of Osseo, Minnesota. To this union were added four children: Shirley Arlene, David Arnold, Harriet Irene, and Nancy Nell.<br>
The Scotts lived at Maple Plain until last fall when Mr. Scott's health had failed so much he could not continue his work. The cause of his illness proved to be a tumor lodged inside the skull. He was at his home during the latter part of his illness and passing.<br>
He is survived by his wife and children, by his parents; by five sisters; Lillian [Mrs Earl Snodgrass] of Buffalo, Minnesota; Mae at home; Zella [Mrs Ennis Batdorf], Wayzata; Florence [Mrs. Albert Titus], Robbinsdale; Myrtle [Mrs John Schleifer] and brother, Donald both of Minneapolis.<br>
Funeral services were held Wednesday afternoon at 2 o'clock at the Osseo Methodist Church, Rev. Upton Dahle officiating, assisted by Rev. Roy Stinlund of Armstrong.<br>
Six nephews acted as pallbearers: Merlin, Harold and Warren Snodgrass, and Raymond and Harvey Batdorf, and Harlyn Street.<br>
Interment was made in Niggler Cemetery.<br>
<br>
-------------------------------------------------------------<br>
Thomas Henry Scott Jr. was born 17 Mar 1904, at the home of his parents, on Lake Sarah, near Rockford, Minnesota, in Hennepin County. He was the first son of Thomas and Mary Harriet [Prestidge] Scott. He grew up and went to school in the Rockford area, but did not complete grade school.<br>
At one time my dad [Tom] had a ferret. He kept the ferret in a barrel of straw in the basement. Sometimes the ferret would bite the fingers of one of us kids. A ferret will not release their bite until they draw blood, so the only way we could get our finger out of it's mouth was to spit on the ferrets nose so it couldn't breath, or put it's head under water.<br>
The ferret was used to flush rabbits out of their burrow. He would put the ferret into the burrow and then it would chase the rabbits out. The kids had to stand guard and let him know which hole the rabbit came out of, so he could shoot it. He had a problem with the ferret killing the rabbits, and eating them, then the ferret's hunger would be satisfied and it would not come back out of the burrow. He took care of that problem by taking the ferret to the dentist, and having it's teeth cut off, so it could not hurt the rabbits. My brother David went to the Dentist with him, and watched as Daddy held down the Ferret and the Dentist took care of his teeth. He first went to a dentist in Delano, who refused to do the job, and then to the Dentist in Rockford, who didn't mind working on the teeth of a ferret.<br>
Until Tom became ill with a malignant brain tumor, he farmed with his father Thomas Scott Sr. The family then moved to Osseo, Minnesota. Tom is remembered for an outstanding sense of humor, a remarkably good singing voice, his drive toward hard work, and best of all: his love for his children.<br>

Warren Farrar SCOTT
<p>
<a name ="I063947"><b>[I063947]</b></a><br />
When someone is identified as a natural leader, certain images come to mind. First thoughts are of a no-nonsense, tough-minded, dedicated and disciplined person. This description accurately fits Warren Farrar Scott who was indeed a born manager. He will be remembered as being highly organized, practical and realistic. He was a person who always carried a strong sense of duty with him throughout his life. Possessed with traditional "old school" morals, Warren was an individual who clearly communicated to those around him just who he was and what he was all about. Everyone acquainted with Warren knew him as a well-respected man who was a stable force in his community.<br>
Warren was born on August 10, 1923 in Cleveland, Ohio. His parents were Earl and Blanche Scott. Warren was raised in Cleveland, Ohio. Even as a youngster, Warren learned to be objective and decisive. His faith in the principles of authority and dependability was something that he carried with him throughout his life.<br>
As a young boy, Warren was able to put his natural abilities to work. He was a bit like the sergeant of the family, helping to make sure that the others did what they should do and that they avoided those things they weren't supposed to. In other words, he liked to organize and direct. Warren was raised with one sibling. He had one older brother, Edmond. Warren had an inborn appreciation for the order in the family, allowing for the oldest members to be the most respected and to take on the most responsibility. For Warren, this was a natural order of life, one he gladly embraced.<br>
Warren's matter-of-fact attitude about most things was developed during his childhood. As a young boy, Warren enjoyed being part of teams, and organizations and groups of other kids who shared similar interests. Warren took part in baseball. In his spare time he liked horseback riding, boating and swimming. Warren's memorable achievements included being an above average student.<br>
In school, Warren was as close to being a model student as one could possibly imagine. He sought to achieve perfect attendance in all of his classes. He would eagerly complete his homework, and often put in extra study time when he felt it was necessary. A logical and focused thinker, Warren was always good at following directions and meeting his schedules, whether they were set by his teachers or were self-imposed. Warren's personal motto could well have been, "Do it right the first time." He graduated from East Technical High School in 1942. He enjoyed some courses more than others, having favorite classes and teachers. His favorite class in high school was Mechanical Drawing, French, Sheet Metal Shop and Machine Shop. Received citizenship awards in Jr. High School, High School, played the violin and joined the school orchestra.<br>
Warren's practical work ethic carried over into his college years. His logical mind permitted him to work hard without succumbing to the usual distractions of college life. He would tackle an assignment and work through it before moving onto the next project. Warren's orderly nature gave way to establishing personal study habits and procedures that not only helped him stay on track but often put him ahead of schedule. When Warren saw the need or benefit, he would willingly take on the extra assignment or even attend extra classes in order to learn more and become a better student. He earned his Bachelor of Arts degree in Business from Western Reserve University. His favorite courses were Mechanical Engineering. Was drafted in WWII and attended college on GI Bill.<br>
Warren was sociable and approachable. Because he was always so straightforward in how he approached relationships, friends and family knew that what they saw was always what they got. He enjoyed the camaraderie of being with a group of friends. When Warren was a member of a group, his interaction worked to keep the others grounded. He wasn't afraid to confront his friends and, when necessary, he challenged them to stick to the task at hand. Those close to Warren came to expect his high standards of performance. While growing up, some of his best friends were Harry Olds, Don Armour, Harold Reinwald and Curt Denton. Later in life, he became friends with Irene and Charlie Cook, Anne Atcherson, Damon and Chevy Goldstein and Dick and Sylvia Eckhardt.<br>
An objective and conscientious individual, Warren reveled in the security of his family. On May 6, 1966 Warren exchanged wedding vows with Constance Mae Tilton at the Hollywood Presbyterian Church of Hollywood, California. One of Warren's most endearing qualities was his uncanny ability to remember important dates and anniversaries, and his unending enthusiasm for organizing a celebration for his family and friends.<br>
Warren was ever watchful of his children. He worried about them and was deeply concerned for their development as they grew up. He maintained a firm hand in their upbringing. Warren would give his stamp of approval to their requests, as long as he could see how they might benefit. He also had the ability to enforce the rules as needed to ensure that his children were properly raised. Warren was blessed with three children, two sons, Geoffrey and Matthew and one daughter, Collette. They were also blessed with one grandchild, Dylan.<br>
Being a hard worker who praised efficiency, Warren was always striving to make improvements where they were necessary. He was able to analyze situations and problems, keeping everything and everyone on track. An excellent project supervisor, Warren was a person who could quickly make decisions based on the information available. He worked cooperatively and expected the same from his colleagues. In both his personal and professional environments, Warren upheld his standards. His primary occupation was Mechanical Engineering. He was employed for 45 years by various companies. Warren was a team player who certainly lived out the motto of "give me a job, and I will get it done."<br>
Warren was an army veteran. His sense of duty helped lead him into the military where his understanding of rank, his willingness to abide by rules and regulations and his desire to follow orders was admired by his fellow service men and women. The Army sent him to Fort Riley, Kansas and then to Colorado School on Mines for Mechanical Engineering. Warren saw action for WWII. Through his hard work and dedication, he achieved the rank of Private - Medic.<br>
Warren approached his leisure time in the same manner that he approached his life. A person who enjoyed being neat and orderly and one who understood the nature of things, he appreciated the hours he was able to devote to his various hobbies. His favorite pursuits were target shooting, square dancing, sports cars, travel and reading. Warren was content to enjoy his favorite pastimes alone but was also willing to share his interests with others.<br>
Playing by the rules was a natural thing for Warren to do in life and that carried over to his enjoyment of sports. In high school, Warren played baseball and swimming. Recreational sports included bowling. He also was something of a sports fan and enjoyed watching his favorite events whenever he got the opportunity.<br>
Being generous with his time and energy, Warren liked to belong to a variety of groups and organizations. He was a vocal leader who enjoyed being a part of things. His desire to uphold traditions and his ability to take charge of any type of project made him a tremendous asset. In high school, Warren was a member of the French Club and De Molay. Throughout his later years, Warren was an active member of the Masons and Ambassadors at Hollywood Presbyterian Church.<br>
A civic-minded person, Warren was usually ready to jump in and help with community activities. He was the type of person who could masterfully organize events and projects and then see to it that they were run in an efficient and timely manner. Warren was a member of several community groups, including serving on committees for the Boy Scouts, Indian Guides and Christmas Parades. Politically, Warren was a member of the Republican Party. During these years, Warren applied his analytical intellect to problem solving and so was an asset on most committees.<br>
Faith was important to Warren. He held high moral standards and was worried about the moral decay he saw around him. For that reason he held deep spiritual beliefs that he was willing to share. He was a member Hollywood Presbyterian Church and Church of the Masters Baptist Church in Cleveland, Ohio.<br>
As someone who placed a high value on showing gratitude, Warren could graciously accept a "thank you" extended to him by those he helped. However, individual recognition wasn't a motivating force for Warren; rather, when he saw that there was a need to get something done, he was more than willing to give his time and energy in order to see it accomplished. Some of his most prestigious awards included Who's Who in California.<br>
When it came time to travel or take a vacation, Warren used his scheduling expertise to make sure everyone and everything was ready to go. That also meant that he made certain no single person was overworked in putting the trip together. Warren had a knack for making sure that everyone who was involved had their specific tasks and that those tasks were completed. Favorite vacations included Northwest, Big Sur, Russian River, Buffalo Prarie, Illinois and Cleveland, Ohio.<br>
Warren was a lover of animals and cherished his pets. One of Warren's favorites was Ginger, the orange tiger cat. They were best friends for 18 years. His family was rounded out by his dog, Bear.<br>
When Warren's retirement finally arrived in 1993, he was well prepared. He used his critical evaluation skills to make sure that every detail had been preplanned and attended to. In retirement, he found new pleasure in target practice, working on his MG, traveling in his motorhome and reading. In many ways, Warren loved retirement. It provided him with the opportunity to catch up with his friends, attend functions and group outings, and tackle new interesting activities.<br>
Warren passed away on January 14, 2011 at Country Villa in Arcadia, California. He is survived by his wife Constance, his children Collette, Geoffrey and Matthew, his grandson Dylan and his son-in-law Adam. Services were held at Custer Christiansen Chapel in Covina, California.<br>
All who knew him would agree that Warren was a pillar of the community. He lived his life with his feet firmly on the ground. He had a strong work ethic, was pragmatic in his thoughts and acts, and constantly sought the means for self-improvement. He was willing to share his ideas and knowledge for the benefit of others, so that they could accomplish more in their lives. Warren Farrar Scott did his best to ensure that his family, friends, loved ones, co-workers, and everyone whose life he touched was given the chance to become a better person.<br>
<br>
January, 2011<br>
On this day we bury Warren Scott, trusted friend, the one we laughed with, lived for, dreamed with, and loved. In the end, it's always about character. "I'm proud to be an American," he often said. His voice lingers in our hearts and memories. "What a country." He was a patriot, conditioned by the great depression.<br>
Warren was born on August 23, 1923. He cherished the good times. This Scottish kid from Cleveland, Ohio, worked hard and loved every minute of it. He lived with integrity, always reaching down to help someone else up. He had a good sense of self, an appreciation for the gift of life. He became a mechanical engineer, showing integrity, fairness, and respect for all. Our loss is profound. We loved him; we'll miss him; and we'll never forget him. <br>
When Warren was two years old, he lost his father. His mother moved into her father's three story house, with her boys, in Cleveland, and that's where Warren was brought up. His grandfather owned Edmonds Elevator Co. Otis once worked for the Edmonds Elevator Co. The grandfather told him he didn't have the wherewithall to make it in the elevator business.<br>
Warren's mother Blanche, was a tiny, feisty woman, who played the drums, in parades down Euclid Ave., in Cleveland. She was determined her boys have the best of everything, and later worked at Higbee's, when they were in high school, stocking their shelves. She raised her boys to be God fearing, at Church of the Master Baptist Church. <br>
Warren's father Earl, was a left handed carpenter; he was always trying to get the other carpenters on the job to join the union. Needless to say, he was fired from many jobs. <br>
Warren had a brother Edmond, who was 22 months older than he. Edmond had a great sense of humor and a charm about him that made him a natural leader. He was tall and lanky, with strawberry blonde hair. Warren and his brother had many friends who hung out at their home. They spent happy hours playing pool on the 3rd floor, or pingpong in the basement. When Ed got his driver's license, he bought a 1930's, model car in which he transported his friends. They pooled their money for gas; sometimes it was exciting just to hang on. Unfortunately, Edmond lost his life when he was 21 years old, in a tragic accident.<br>
Warren and his brother did so well in school that they were placed in a Major Work Class, for above average students. In the class they were taught French by a teacher named Madamoiselle La Marca, who turned out to be Warren's favorite teacher. They learned by conversations with the teacher; they did not have textbooks. Warren also played the violin in the school orchestra.<br>
At East Technical High School, Warren took mechanical drawing, sheet metal shop, and machine shop. This foundation paved the way for his later career which was Mechanical Engineering.<br>
When Warren graduated high school, he went to work as an engine lathe operator. While there, the Japanese bombed Pearl Harbor, December 7, 194l; he was drafted February 15, 1943. He trained at Ft. Riley, Ks., then the army sent him to Golden Colorado, where he was trained as a mechanical engineer. When his stint in the army was over, he entered college, on the GI Bill, eventually graduating from Cleveland College, a part of Western Reserve University. <br>
In 1937, Warren's grandfather, 86, who help raise Blanche's boys, slipped on the ice on his way to work, ended up in the hospital and ultimately died of pneumonia. This changed the families priorities drastically. His mother turned the 2nd floor of the house into two light housekeeping units, and rented them out in order to have an income.<br>
Later in his life, in 1964, Warren met Connie Tilton, at Hollywood Presbyterian Church. He fell in love and pledged to be her lifelong partner. They were married at the same church in 1966, surrounded by their Ambassador friends. Warren and Connie had three children, Collette, Geoffrey (pronounced Jeffrey), and Matthew. <br>
Connie moved from Hollywood to West Covina, where Warren had a house, and in 1972, the family moved to their current home in Covina. The couple had three children, Collette, Geoffrey, (pronounced Jeffrey), and Matthew. Collette's friends eventually dubbed it, "Mr. Roger's Neighborhood. <br>
Warren's influence on his family was far reaching. He expressed joy at the birth of his children. He was an eager participant in all holidays, birthdays, Valentines Day, Easter, July 4th, Flag Day, Thanksgiving, and Christmas. He hung the flag in front of their house, every chance he got. He had tears in his eyes when he moved his son Matt into dorms at UCSB.<br>
We see him at the Russian River, telling us the history of the area, coke and hamburger in hand. He was an eager participant in Indian Guides, The Covina Christmas Parade, Boy Scouts, Girl Scouts, attending all the games played by Collette, Geoff, (Jeff) and Matt, in their formative years. He rescued Collette, and her friends, many times, from nefarious circumstances in the middle of the night. The family vacationed every summer, in their trailer. Warren, the master planner of vacations, and trivia expert, happily drove his little family around the United States, giving them a sense of history and filling them with a sense of awe in our great country. <br>
San Clemente was a special treat every summer, even though Warren didn't like the beach. He would tow the trailer down to the beach, where Connie and the kids joined the Goldsteins for a week of frolic. Warren would then drive back to Covina where he could enjoy a week of peace, quiet, and book reading. He was a boy of summer, and always left us smiling. We blow him a kiss on a fresh summer's day.<br>
Our love led us here today. He protected and nurtured us, and he never never broke our hearts. The legacy he leaves behind are the lessons he lived. He was a violin player, piano player, car buff, and photographer. Our Maker has taken our partner and friend.<br>
