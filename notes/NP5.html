Abner ALLEN
<p>
<a name ="I063994"><b>[I063994]</b></a><br />
Research indicates that one of the earliest Allen immigrants was the father of Abner Allen Sr., who settled in Windham County, Connecticut. The name of his father has not been determined at this time. In the U.S. Census Records, 1790, five Allens. Four (Abner, William, Joseph, and Asael) were recorded living in Windham County, Windham Town, Connectucut, all on page 153, Daniel, listed on page 152. Abner, would have been 9 years of age. Any one of these Allen males could have been Abner's father as each one of them had sons less than 16 years of age.<br>
In the U.S. Census Records of 1800, six Allen families lived in Windham County, Connecticut. Three (Abner, John and Amos) lived in Windham; and three (Abner, Thaddeus, and Abner) lived in Killingly, which was 15 miles east of Windham. The latter Abner could possibly be 1-1. Having been born in 1781 would have been 19 years of age with a small son. His wife, Patty, appears to be older in the census records as she was in the cemetery records.<br>
Abner Jr. and Nathan W. were in born in 1807 and 1806, respectively, in Connecticut. An Allen researcher believes the family moved to New York from Windham Co. after 1807, possibly Cayuga, where Silas S. and Wheaton were born to Abner and Patty. The 1810 census has not been doucmented, but this researcher will follow up on establishing the whereabouts of the family in this year.<br>
In 1820, Abner Allen moved to Madison, Geauga County(Lake County, after 1840) Ohio. A tavern, The Allen House, was built at Madison Dock at the mouth of the Grand River and was apparently owned by Abner. Abner and Patty Allen had eight children. Six years after settling in their new location, Abner, at the age of 45 committed suicide by hanging. He died on July 22, 1826.<br>

Edward Ellis ALLEN
<p>
<a name ="I071713"><b>[I071713]</b></a><br />
Edward E. Allen (1861-1950) was born in Massachusetts, the oldest of four siblings. He attended a progressive and unconventional residential school founded by his uncle, Nathaniel Allen, where his father James taught. He later attended school in Germany and entered Harvard at age 18, focusing on biology and modern languages and graduating cum laude. He grew up immersed in education. He attended medical school for one year but took a couple years off to support his brotherʼs education. He and his wife Katharine had two children and five grandchildren. While teaching at the Royal Normal College for the Blind in London from 1885-1888 he discovered his true calling of teaching students who were blind.<br>
In 1888 Allen received an offer to teach and serve as headmaster at the Perkins School for the Blind. Two years later, he became principal and director of the Overbrook School for the Blind, where he oversaw the design and construction of the campus. The plan and layout which allowed students to travel independently and safely became a model for other schools for the blind. Returning to Perkins School for the Blind as Director from 1907 until 1931, he was once again the architect and builder of that campus. These buildings at Perkins and Overbrook are still in use.<br>
Throughout his career Dr. Allen sponsored research in educational methods and in 1920 created the first professional training program for teachers of the visually impaired in partnership with Harvard College. It has been said that his greatest contribution to the field lay in his insistence that educational methods focus on the needs and gifts of the student. To this end he invested in playground equipment and swimming pools, integrated child-centered teaching techniques, and introduced speech therapists, corrective movement instructors, psychologists and social workers.<br>
Beginning in the late 19th century he championed the braille code as the universal writing system for readers who are blind. He was one of the few educators who knew all four Braille codes which were struggling for supremacy in American schools for the blind. In 1898 he introduced the first interpoint and interlinear braille embossing equipment in the United States. Later he sponsored research and the development of standardized testing which established that the intelligence of people with visual impairment is unimpaired. In partnership with the American Foundation for the Blind he established the Department of Special Studies at Perkins in 1927, which conducted child-based research to introduce innovations in the education of students who are blind.<br>
In 1931 the University of Pennsylvania recognized Allenʼs work with an honorary doctor of science degree. Other awards include the Leslie Dana Gold Medal from the National Society for Prevention of Blindness, the Gold Medal from the Institute of Social Sciences and the Shotwell Gold Medal from the American Association of Workers for the Blind.<br>
Allen frequently contributed to Outlook for the Blind and authored the column "Dr. Allen Says" in Teachers Forum from 1932 until 1946. In addition to articles on the education of the blind, he also wrote on the topics of industrial training for the blind, cause and prevention of blindness and the deaf/blind. His educational innovations were driven by the understanding that the needs and gifts of the individual student must be integrated in to the teaching plan.<br>
