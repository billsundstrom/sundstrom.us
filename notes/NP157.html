<h2>Notes</h2>
Ludwig II of EAST-FRANCIA
<p>
<a name ="I004762"><b>[I004762]</b></a><br />
From Wikipedia<br>
<br>
Louis the German (also known as Louis II) (804 - September 28, 876), the third son of the emperor Louis the Pious and his first wife, Irmengarde, was ruler of Eastern Francia from 817 until his death.<br>
<br>
His early years were partly spent at the court of his grandfather, Charlemagne, whose special affection he is said to have won. When the emperor Louis divided his dominions between his sons in 817, Louis received Bavaria and the neighbouring lands, but did not undertake the government until 825, when he became involved in war with the Wends and Sorbs on his eastern frontier. In 827 he married Emma, sister of his stepmother Judith, and daughter of Welf I, whose possessions ranged from Alsace to Bavaria. Louis soon began to interfere in the quarrels arising from Judith's efforts to secure a kingdom for her own son Charles (later known as Charles the Bald), and the consequent struggles of Louis and his brothers with the emperor Louis I.<br>
<br>
When the elder Louis died in 840 and his eldest son Lothar claimed the whole Empire, Louis allied with his half-brother, (now) king Charles the Bald, and defeated Lothar at Fontenoy in June 841. In June 842, the three brothers met on an island in the Saone to negotiate a peace, and each appointed forty representatives to arrange the boundaries of their respective kingdoms. This developed into the Treaty of Verdun concluded in August 843, by which Louis received the bulk of the lands of the Carolingian empire lying east of the Rhine, together with a district around Speyer, Worms and Mainz, on the left bank of the river. His territories included Bavaria, where he made Regensburg the centre of his government, Thuringia, Franconia and Saxony. He may truly be called the founder of the German kingdom, though his attempts to maintain the unity of the Empire proved futile. Having in 842 crushed a rising in Saxony, he compelled the Obotrites to own his authority, and undertook campaigns against the Bohemians, the Moravians and other tribes, but was not very successful in freeing his shores from the ravages of Danish pirates.<br>
<br>
At his instance, synods and assemblies were held where laws were decreed for the better government of church and state. In 853 and the following years, Louis made more than one attempt to secure the throne of Aquitaine, which, according to the Annals of the Abbey of Fulda (Annales Fuldensis), the people of that country offered him in their disgust with the cruel misrule of Charles the Bald. Encouraged by his nephews Pepin II of Aquitaine and Charles of Provence, Louis invaded; Charles the Bald could not even raise an army to resist the invasion, and in 858 Louis issued a charter dated "the first year of the reign in West Francia." Treachery and desertion in his army, and the loyalty to Charles of the Aquitanian bishops brought about the failure of the enterprise, which Louis renounced by a treaty signed at Coblenz on June 7, 860.<br>
<br>
In 855 the emperor Lothair died, and Louis and Charles for a time seem to have cooperated in plans to divide Lothar's possessions among themselves -- the only impediments to this being Lothar's sons, Lothar II, Louis II, and Charles of Provence. In 863 on the death of Charles, they divided Provence and Burgundy between them. In 868 at Metz they agreed definitely to a partition; but when Lothar II died in 869, Louis the German was lying seriously ill, and his armies were engaged with the Moravians. Charles the Bald accordingly seized the whole kingdom; but Louis the German, having recovered, compelled him by a threat of war to agree to the treaty of Mersen, which divided it between the claimants.<br>
<br>
The later years of Louis the German were troubled by risings on the part of his sons, the eldest of whom, Carloman, revolted in 861 and again two years later; an example that was followed by the second son Louis, who in a further rising was joined by his brother Charles. A report that the emperor Louis II was dead led to peace between father and sons and attempts by Louis the German to gain the imperial crown for Carloman. These efforts were thwarted by Louis II, who was not in fact dead, and his uncle, Charles the Bald.<br>
<br>
Louis was preparing for war when he died on September 28, 876 at Frankfurt. He was buried at the abbey of Lorsch, leaving three sons and three daughters. Louis is considered by many to be the most competent of the descendants of Charlemagne. He obtained for his kingdom a certain degree of security in face of the attacks of Normans, Hungarians, Moravians and others. He lived in close alliance with the Church, to which he was very generous, and entered eagerly into schemes for the conversion of his heathen neighbours.<br>

Janet Melissa EATON
<p>
<a name ="I081719"><b>[I081719]</b></a><br />
Janet Melissa (Perry) Myrick passed away January 7, 2021 in Flagstaff, Arizona where she had been residing with her son, Bob, and family for the last 15 months.<br>
She was born April 17, 1930 in Sherman County, Oregon, delivered at home by her father on Easter Sunday.<br>
She was the daughter of Oscar Karl and Louise Janet (Hamilton) Eaton.<br>
Raised in Pendleton, OR., Janet began her married life in Portland, OR., and then 10 subsequent years in Lake Oswego, OR., where her husband, William (Bill) Clark Perry, Jr., owned and operated a finance business, while Janet raised their three children, JoAnne, William (Corky) and Robert (Bob).<br>
She and her husband, Bill, then packed up the family and moved to Flagstaff, AZ., in 1969 where they owned and operated the Travelodge Motel for 31 years. After Bill's passing in 1992 she moved to Kailua-Kona, Hawaii where she bought an oceanfront condo. She attended the Christian University at YWAM and went on mission trips to Indonesia and the Philippines. She also volunteered at the Kona Pregnancy Center, counseling unmarried girls and providing them with the options of adoption for their babies. Janet was also a Chaplain at the Kona Community Hospital, hosted weekly bible studies in her condo, and was very active in her church, Mokuaikaua Congregational Church. Janet was a member of Gideon's International and passed out bibles to the community. In addition, Janet volunteered at Kona Hospice offering support to patients and grief counseling to their families.<br>
Janet met her second husband, Ted Myrick at a Pendleton High School Reunion. They were married in 2000, and enjoyed their life together in Kona until Ted's passing in 2012.<br>
Janet loved to paint, her smile could light up a room, and she never met a stranger. Janet simply loved people, and perhaps her greatest strength was her endless and inexhaustible gift of exhorting, or "lifting" people up, to restore joy and happiness into their hearts. Her single-minded goal was to see a smile on every person's face that she met! But before all that, was her unwavering love for Jesus. She would share His love at any opportunity. In Janet's own words, she wrote, "If I could live my life over again, I would trust Jesus more."<br>
Janet is survived by a daughter JoAnne (Steve) Rost of Dallas, Texas, son William (Cathryn) Perry of Bremerton, Washington and son Robert (Shanna) Perry of Flagstaff, Arizona, and a sister Pat (Sid) Long of Fort Bragg, California. She also has 6 grandchildren and 8 great grandchildren.<br>
She is preceded in death by her parents, brothers William Eaton and Robert Eaton, husband William Perry and husband Ted Myrick.<br>
The family plans to have a graveside service in Pendleton, Oregon sometime in the summer.<br>
We will miss you Mom. Love always.<br>

Steven Joseph EBERTS
<p>
<a name ="I040498"><b>[I040498]</b></a><br />
Steven Joseph Eberts was born March 1, 1922, in Qu'appelle, Saskatchewan. He attended Kindred School near Holdfast until he was nine years old and later went to Goldridge School south of Duke and attended until Grade 8. <br>
He entered the armed forces on October 28, 1942 and served during World War II until December 1945, and returned home. His training began in Regina and Dundurn. He then traveled to England and Scotland and completed three more months of training. After thirteen days on the ocean, he landed in Sicily. Steve says that the Germans shot the engine out of the train he was on, and his troop had to set up camp in a vineyard. They were low on provisions so they ended up eating a lot of grapes (no indoor plumbing). <br>
Steve's years in the service allowed him to travel to many places in the World. He went on to Marseilles, France and was even involved with the liberation of Holland (to this day the people of Holland are grateful). <br>
In the spring of 1947, Steve was groomsmen for brother John's wedding, where he met a lovely bridesmaid and sister of John's wife, Sis. He was smitten and on May 3, 1948 he married Dorothy Ackerman. <br>
Steve and Dorothy farmed near Dilke, Saskatchewan for two years, and then they bought a farm near Lumsden. They lived on the farm until 1962, and then built a home in the Town of Lumsden to raise their growing family. Steve and Dorothy continued to farm until 1980. Steve was affectionately known as the "suitcase farmer" because he drove back and forth to the farm for many years. In fact, "suitcase fanner" became his 'handle' on the CB radio.<br>
