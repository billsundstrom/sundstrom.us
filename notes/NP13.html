I grew up in a small town on a big island. I've always loved being outside, climbing trees and swimming in the ocean waves or just simply exploring. I got interested in photography at a young age and started photographing what I saw. People have always been the focus of my images. Scenery can be dramatic and beautiful, but for me if there isn't a person in the photo it's not interesting. Portraits, sports and candid moments are what I mostly shoot.<br>

Mary Jo ARMSTRONG
<p>
<a name ="I030445"><b>[I030445]</b></a><br />
Our mother, Mary Jo Dwire , passed away peacefully on Sunday, Oct. 28, 2012. She was born Mary Jo Armstrong in El Paso, Texas on Aug. 20, 1920. Her family moved to Alamogordo, NM when she was 8 years old. She met Bill Dwire in high school and they were married on Dec. 28, 1939. <br>
As a young wife and mother, Mary Jo's life was devoted to her husband, her two sons: Ron and Jim, and her granddaughter Gail, whom she raised from the age of 2. Due to Bill's military career and job, they lived in Albuquerque, NM; Virginia Beach, VA; Alamogordo, NM; Detroit, MI; Gary, IN; and Birmingham, MI. They resided in Michigan from 1952 to 1985 and then moved to Green Valley, AZ. <br>
Mary Jo developed wonderful friendships with her neighbors in Green Valley and also kept in contact with her friends in Michigan. She and Bill returned to Michigan for several years during the summer months until they purchased their home on Calle Amadeo. <br>
Throughout her life, Mary Jo enjoyed all of the home arts: knitting, crocheting, embroidery, cross-stitch and needlepoint. She made dozens of detailed Christmas ornaments and stockings for her children, grandchildren, and great-grandchildren. In Arizona she learned to bead and made intricate beaded necklaces and earrings. She also took lessons in watercolor and oil painting and became an extremely talented artist. Her paintings are proudly displayed throughout her children's and grandchildren's homes. <br>
Mary Jo became very involved in the Woman's Auxiliary Group in Green Valley, and was a band-aide for the Green Valley band. Due to health issues, Mary Jo and Bill moved to La Posada in Green Valley. <br>
Mom truly understood Godly love. She loved unconditionally and shared it freely with family and friends. She was a devoted wife, mother, grandmother, great-grandmother, great-great-grandmother, and friend, which is reflected in those whose lives she touched. She was married to Bill for 72 years when he passed away in April of this year. <br>
At her request, Mary Jo was cremated without ceremony. Her family will take her remains to Taos, NM, next spring. Her ashes will be scattered in Hondo Canyon, where her husband, Bill's ashes were scattered. <br>
Mary Jo is survived by two sons: Ron (Judy) Dwire and Jim (Fran) Dwire ; five grandchildren: Shari Chaffin, Gail Seymour, Amy Chaffin, John Dwire , and Thomas Dwire along with six great-grandchildren, and two great-great-grandchildren. She will be terribly missed. <br>

Marshall Joseph ARONSTAM
<p>
<a name ="I083688"><b>[I083688]</b></a><br />
SOUTH DEERFIELD - Marshall Joseph Aronstam , 75, of South Deerfield, passed away Sunday, Feb. 2, 2014, at home, after a hard fought battle with cancer. <br>
Marshall was born Feb. 23, 1938, in Burlington, Vt., and was an only child to the late Ida Warshavorski Colodny and Allan Joseph Aronstam . After growing up in Vermont and graduating from Burlington High School in 1956, Marshall went on to join the United States Army. He spent a brief period of time at Fort Benjamin, Ind., before returning to Vermont where he would attend the University of Vermont, and later graduate from Johnson State College in Vermont, with a degree in education. <br>
Marshall was the devoted husband of Martha Robinson Aronstam for 49 years. Not long after they exchanged vows on Aug. 29, 1964, Marshall landed a job as principal of the Goshen Elementary School. Little did he know at that time, he was laying the foundation for what would be a journey of over 40 years in the wonderful world of education. <br>
In 1968, Marshall , or "Mr. A" as his students would refer to him, became principal and teacher at the Sunderland and Whately Elementary schools. He made the move from Goshen to South Deerfield in 1973, which is where he and Martha raised their family, as she ran a home daycare. It was 1977 that he settled his teaching roots firmly in Sunderland, and could be found swiftly walking the halls, with a smile on his face, until his retirement in 2003. For 26 years, Marshall also represented the town of Deerfield on the Franklin County Technical School Committee, until he retired in 2005. <br>
His passion for teaching children overflowed well outside the walls of the school. Marshall coached youth baseball for 16 years, and played a major roll in starting a girls softball program, known as the "Lassie League". When he wasn't setting the line up for his own team, you could find him, or hear him, in the stands cheering on his beloved Frontier Redskins (turned Redhawks) at every event he could get to. From football to softball, and everything in between, his presence was known, just ask the officials! If that wasn't enough he was also a season ticket holder for the University of Massachusetts Football, Basketball and Hockey, to which he was a regular in attendance. An avid New England sports fan, he was happy to talk about his love for the Red Sox, Celtics and Patriots, to anyone who would listen. <br>
In the 80's, Marshall found there were others who shared his enthusiasm for sports, specifically basketball. Come March every year they'd travel all over the country to attend the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) tournament together. This group of men eventually grew into an incredibly charitable pillar of the community and in 1999 gave themselves a name, the "Sunset Hoopsters". They were without a doubt some of Marshall's dearest friends. <br>
A common meeting place for the "Hoopsters" tended to be the Polish American Citizens Club in South Deerfield. Marshall was not shy when it came to his Polish heritage, and was proud to have been a Lifetime Member, and serve as a director and secretary for 20 years. Through his involvement with "the club", Marshall became greatly involved with the Relay for Life, and even helped his granddaughter organize the first "all-kids team" in Franklin County in the late 90's. <br>
He was an active member and Deacon at the South Deerfield Congregational Church, where he helped organize the Adopt a Family program, and would make sure your coffee cup never went dry at a church supper. Marshall was also involved in the Rotary Clubs of Williamsburg and South Deerfield. <br>
How does one find the energy to accomplish even half of what he did every day? He would likely suggest starting your morning off with breakfast at Jerry's Place, followed by lunch from the BBA Polish Deli, and some spaghetti and meatballs from Holiday Pizza for dinner. Between meals, make sure to stay positive, and always be kind to others. Above all else, Marshall 's family was most important to him. He never let his busy schedule allow him to miss a single game, or recital, awards ceremony, or banquet for any of his children or grandchildren. And the most important dates marked on his calendar were not that of birthdays, anniversaries or holidays, it was the first two weeks in August, when the whole family would vacation together in Maine. Two full weeks of nonstop lawn games, raft floating, card playing, fun-loving family time. But it didn't matter what those weeks entailed really, it was the "importance of togetherness" as he would put it. <br>
Marshall is survived by daughter Leslie Aronstam Wickline and partner Thomas Deskavich of South Deerfield; son Stephen Aronstam of South Deerfield; daughter Lauri Aronstam and partner Mark Durant of Greenfield. He was "Grampy" to Kaeli, Molly and Ethan Wickline, all of South Deerfield, and was overjoyed to have spent the last two and a half years getting to know his great-grandson, the "Big Fella", Carter Marshall Malouin. He also leaves sister and brother-in-law Susan and James Taylor Carter; sister-in-law Priscilla Britton; sister-in-law Mabel Calkins; and many nieces and nephews. <br>
He joins those who have predeceased him, including his daughter Lisa Ann and sister-in-law Polly Riley. <br>
There will be no calling hours or funeral service, but rather, a celebration of life, which is what Marshall did every day. This will be held Sunday, March 2, at 2 p.m. at Frontier Regional High School, 113 North Main St., South Deerfield, and will be open to any and all who would like to attend. <br>
In lieu of flowers, donations in his name can be made out to the Marshall Aronstam Scholarship Fund, c/o Kaeli Wickline, 9 Thayer St., South Deerfield, MA 01373. <br>
