<a name ="I041120"><b>[I041120]</b></a><br />
It is with great sadness that we announce the sudden passing of our beloved son, father, brother, uncle, nephew, cousin and friend; Craig Pierce. Craig was born in North Bay, ON on February 8, 1974. He passed away on February 10, 2013 at the age of 39. Craig began school in CFB Baden, Germany, attended school in Regina, Redwater, AB, and Yorkton, SK. He graduated from Sacred Heart High School. After high school, he worked at different jobs trying to find his passion. At the time of his death he was employed by CoMec as a pipefitter in Cold Lake, Alberta Craig was a kind, loving, generous and openhearted young man. He gave selflessly and at times, at his own expense. "Scooter" was also a deep thinker constantly trying to make life better for himself and others. He loved being with people and could talk for hours on end. Craig's greatest accomplishments are his two princesses; Harlow and Farran who were the love of his life. From the moment of their births, he was a proud and doting father. The smile on his face and the love in his voice was very evident whenever he spoke of his girls. The girls loved their dada and enjoyed every moment spent with him. He will be sadly missed. Craig spent his leisure time listening to music, golfing, bowling and playing video games. Many Monday nights and weekends were spent cheering for his NFL New York Giants with Harlow and Farran right beside him decked out in team attire. Summer days would find them at the beach or playground in Cold Lake or on occasion Powell River B.C. forming what are now precious memories We will remember him for his sense of humour, 'bear hugs' from the heart and his giving nature. He is a soul who left us too soon, who will never be forgotten. Craig is survived by his mother, Shirley Pierce of Yorkton; his father and step-mother, Jim and Laurie Pierce of Cold Lake, AB; Brother, Ryan (Pakawan) Pierce and JJ of Willeton, Western Australia; his beloved daughters, Farran and Harlow; their mother Samantha Hurrie, her daughters, Michaela and Jasmin; step brother, Mike (Lindsay) Deagnon, Austin, Mackenzie, Aidan; step sister, Holly (Colin) Bernier, Brooklyn, Alexis, Chase; step sister, Julie (Jeff) Saretsky; grandmother, Hellen Pierce; aunt, Pam (Terry) Klassen and family; uncles, Cecil, Stanley and Bruce Pierce and family; special aunt and uncle, Steph and Rick Young, "sister" Amanda and Kris of Redwater, AB; aunts and uncles, Len and Evelyn Loster and family, Murray and Cheryl Loster and family, all of Yorkton, SK as well as numerous nieces, nephews, cousins and friends.

Floyd Ralph Pierce, 90, of Willmar, Minnesota, and a former longtime Crookston, Minnesota resident, died Tuesday morning, May 26, 2009, at Rice Memorial Hospital in Willmar.<br>
Floyd was born on November 11, 1918 in Barnesville, Minnesota, the son of Harry and Ethel (Arms) Pierce. That happened to be Armistice Day, signaling the end of WWI, so bells and sirens were blaring as Floyd came into the world. In 1930 the Pierce family moved to Crookston where Floyd graduated from Crookston Central High School in 1936. On May 11, 1941 he was united in marriage to Fern Kinshella at Barnesville. The couple made their home in Crookston and together raised three children, Joan, Mike, and Lynn. Floyd began working for the Great Northern Railroad in 1942. His career was interrupted when he entered the U.S. Navy on April 20, 1944. During WWII he served aboard the USS Audubon as a Quartermaster, taking part in the Pacific Theater of Operations. He crossed the Pacific four times from Hawaii to Okinawa, the Philippines, New Guinea, Guadalcanal, and other destinations- transporting U.S. servicemen and women from one deployment to another. Following his honorable discharge from the Navy on January 4, 1946, Floyd returned home to his family and resumed his career. In 1978 he retired from the railroad, which by then was known as the Burlington Northern. Fern passed away on September 17, 2003, and a year later Floyd moved to Willmar, where his daughter and son-in-law, Joan and Bob, were living.<br>
Floyd was a longtime member of Crookston's VFW Post #1902 and American Legion Post #20. He was also a member of Crookston Eagles Aerie #873, and Crookston Masonic Lodge #141 AF & AM. Floyd and Fern had been longtime members of the First Presbyterian Church. He will be remembered for his kind and gentle spirit, and delightful sense of humor. He was passionate about reading, and was a lifelong learner to whom many turned for advice. Floyd will be greatly missed by his family and friends.<br>
Grateful to have been a part of Floyd's life are his daughter and son-in-law, Joan and Bob Glaesman of Willmar, MN; son and daughter-in-law, Mike and Jackie Pierce of Eagan, MN; son-in-law, Neal Stenlund and his wife, Pat, of Goodhue, MN; seven grandchildren and one step-grandchild; five great-grandchildren; and one step-great-grandchild; a brother and sister-in-law, Curtis and Alice Pierce of Benson, MN; and several nieces, nephews, and other relatives. Besides his beloved wife of sixty-two years, Floyd was preceded in death by a daughter, Lynn Stenlund, who died in 1994; his parents, Harry and Ethel; a sister and brother-in-law, Evelyn and Lloyd Johnson; and a brother and sister-in-law, Keith and Marjorie Pierce. May God bless Floyd's memory.<br>
The funeral service for Floyd Ralph Pierce will be held in the Stenshoel-Houske Funeral Home in Crookston at 11:00 am, Saturday, May 30, 2009, with the Rev. Bill Reck, officiating.
