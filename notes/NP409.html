Gwenwynwyn ap OWAIN
<p>
<a name ="I010684"><b>[I010684]</b></a><br />
Gwenwynwyn (died c.1216) was the last major ruler of south Wales before the completion of the Norman Conquest. He was a grandson of Owain Gwynedd and ruled southern Powys from 1195, having taken control following the death of the previous ruler.<br>
<br>
His possession of a portion of Powys brought him into conflict with Llywelyn the Great, ruler of Gwynedd, who was keen to extend his own jurisdiction over the whole of Wales. King John favoured Gwenwynwyn until a marriage alliance was made between Llywelyn and John's illegitimate daughter. The two native princes then kept their distance until 1208. As a result of Gwenwynwyn's activities, John confiscated his lands and allowed Llywelyn to steal Ceredigion and Powys. Gwenwynwyn did not get his territory back for two years, but his resentment towards the English led him into an alliance with Llywelyn, which lasted from 1212 until 1216, when John restored some of Gwenwynwyn's property and the two princes fell out again. Llywelyn invaded Powys, and Gwenwynwyn is believed to have died or been killed that same year.<br>

Iorwerth ap OWAIN
<p>
<a name ="I010712"><b>[I010712]</b></a><br />
Yr Hen ("The Old") Iorwerth, of Pengwern; born c1170; Steward of North Powys; married Angharad, daughter of Gruffudd ap Meilir Eutun, and was living 1236. [Burke's Peerage]<br>
</p>
Iorwerth ap OWAIN
<p>
<a name ="I004608"><b>[I004608]</b></a><br />
Iorwerth ab Owain Gwynedd or Iorwerth Drwyndwn (1145-1174), meaning "the broken-nosed", was a legitimate son of Owain Gwynedd (the king of Gwynedd) and his first wife Gwladys ferch Llywarch. He married Marared ferch Madog. His son Llywelyn ab Iorwerth eventually united the realm and became known as Llywelyn Fawr and is one of Wales's most famous monarchs. Iorwerth was killed in battle at a place called Pennant Mehangell during the wars deciding the succession following the death of his father.<br>
</p>
Maredydd ap OWAIN
<p>
<a name ="I008679"><b>[I008679]</b></a><br />
From Wikipedia, 12 June 2006:<br>
<br>
Maredudd ap Owain (died 999) was a Prince of Gwynedd and of Deheubarth.<br>
<br>
Maredydd was the grandson of Hywel Dda. His father, Owain ap Hywel Dda, was king of Deheubarth. As Owain grew too old to lead in battle his son Maredydd took his place, and in 986 captured Gwynedd from Cadwallon ab Ieuaf. On Owain's death in 988 Maredydd also became ruler of Deheubarth. He may have controlled all Wales apart from Gwent and Morgannwg.<br>
<br>
He is recorded as raiding Mercian settlements on the borders of Radnor and as paying a ransom of one penny a head to rescue some of his subjects who had been taken captive in Viking raids. Danish raids were a constant problem during Maredudd's reign. In 987 Godfrey Haroldson raided Anglesey, killing one thousand and carrying away two thousand as captives. Maredudd died in 999 and was described by the annalists as "the most famous king of the Britons". Following his death, the throne of Gwynedd was recovered for the line of Idwal Foel by Cynan ap Hywel.<br>

David Rogers OWEN
<p>
<a name ="I086005"><b>[I086005]</b></a><br />
David Rogers Owen, an internationally known maritime lawyer and accomplished yachtsman, died Friday in his sleep of unknown causes at the Blakehurst retirement community in Towson. <br>
The longtime Riderwood resident was 97. <br>
"The death of David Owen is the passing of an era. He practiced during the Golden Age of maritime law in the post-World War II years, when there were hundreds of American-flagged ships and ship owners," said a nephew, Tony Whitman, a maritime lawyer with the Baltimore firm of Ober/Kaler.<br>
"He was fortunate to have practiced in that time. He was practicing at a time when things were really hopping," he said. <br>
The son of a career Army surgeon, Mr. Owen was born in Honolulu, Hawaii, and raised at various U.S. military installations in California, Texas, Illinois and Washington, D.C. <br>
After graduating in 1932 from Episcopal High School in Alexandria, Va., Mr. Owen earned a bachelor's degree in 1935 in three years from the University of Virginia, where he was a member of Phi Beta Kappa. <br>
He earned a master's degree in economics in 1937, also from the University of Virginia, where he earned his law degree two years later.<br>
Mr. Owen moved in 1939 to Baltimore, where he began practicing general law at Semmes, Bowen & Semmes. <br>
He worked in a variety of fields including "corporations, estates, trials, and appeals," Mr. Owen wrote in an unpublished autobiographical sketch. He described his legal work as "everything from admiralty to zoning and considered it a very valuable experience." <br>
Mr. Owen was away from the firm for five years during World War II, when he enlisted in the Navy. Initially, he served in naval intelligence before becoming executive officer and navigator aboard the USS Ordronaux, a destroyer serving in the Atlantic and Pacific theaters. <br>
One of Mr. Owens' great wartime experiences occurred on Good Friday, April 7, 1944, when the Ordronaux, with other ships, successfully attacked and brought to the surface U-boat 856 in rough North Atlantic waters south of Nova Scotia, which the group then sank. <br>
At great peril to the safety of the Ordronaux, its captain ordered it stopped to pick up 17 floundering German seamen, including the U-856's captain, Fritz Whittenberg, after the U-boat went down. <br>
"I strapped on my .45 and went to the quarterdeck, which was virtually underwater from the rough seas," Mr. Owen said in a 1998 unpublished oral interview. <br>
The first person aboard the Ordronaux was the U-boat captain, at which point, Mr. Owen aimed his pistol. <br>
"He said in perfect English, 'I don't think you'll be needing that today,' " recalled Mr. Owen. "Had it been possible to bore a hole in the deck and drop me through to the bottom of the ocean, I would have been quite satisfied. It was indeed, the ultimate put-down." <br>
After the war, Mr. Owen remained an active Naval Reservist, attaining the rank of captain and serving for 33 years. <br>
After returning to his old law firm, the young lawyer gained a measure of fame in 1946 when he did legal work for H.L. Mencken, who brought suit against his Hollins Street neighbor, Charles Fortenbaugh, because his barking dog disturbed the writer. <br>
After newspapers and wire services picked up the story, the dog that tortured "The Sage of Baltimore" was removed by its owner. <br>
In 1953, Mr. Owen, in a legal capacity, helped incorporate the A.S. Abell Company Foundation Inc., after the owners of The Sun, Sunday Sun and Evening Sun established it. <br>
From his young age throughout his life, Mr. Owen said, he had "a love of anything ocean and anything pertaining to the ocean." <br>
By the early 1950s, Mr. Owen exclusively focused his legal career on admiralty law. During his career, he had any number of highly visible cases, such as representing a ship owner whose vessel collided in 1953 with the Pennsylvania Railroad bridge over the Chesapeake & Delaware Canal. The collision knocked out railroad service to the Delmarva Peninsula for six months. <br>
"We won the case, which is understandable only to an admiralty lawyer, in that we achieved limitation of liability," he said in the oral interview. <br>
James W. Bartlett III, a maritime lawyer at Semmes, Bowen & Semmes, was a friend and colleague. <br>
" David really was responsible for bringing maritime law to the firm in the early 1950s. And through the years, he handled various maritime cases including collisions at sea, insurance, casualty and liability cases, and was well thought of as an appellate lawyer," said Mr. Bartlett, a member of the firm since 1975. <br>
"He's also the man who taught me the trade of maritime law and he was quite a teacher," said Mr. Bartlett. "He was extremely exacting and a person who took lots of pride in what he put out and that was good training for me as a lawyer." <br>
Mr. Owen, who rose to become chairman of his law firm, retired in 1983. He remained of counsel to the firm through the 1990s, and wrote and lectured widely on maritime matters. <br>
Mr, Owen had been a member of the Maryland Bar Association and a fellow of the American College of Trial Lawyers. He had served twice as president of the Maritime Law Association of the United States. <br>
In addition to being an avid yachtsman, Mr. Owen collected marine art. <br>
Funeral services will be held at 10 a.m. today at the Episcopal Church of the Good Shepherd, 1401 Carrollton Ave., Ruxton, where he was a member. <br>
Surviving are his wife of 40 years, the former Eleanor Abell Adams; a son, David J. Owen of Bridgeport, Conn.; a stepson, Charles S. Adams Jr. of Newport, R.I.; two stepdaughters, Margaret A. "Peggy" Szczerbicki of Wiltondale and Eleanor A. "Ellie" Lewis of Norfolk, Va.; a brother, John J. Owen of Charlottesville, Va.; and a grandson. An earlier marriage to the former Isabel Whitman ended in divorce.<br>

John Jerauld OWEN
<p>
<a name ="I086015"><b>[I086015]</b></a><br />
John Jerauld Owen "Jack", 96, The University of Virginia's first Vice President for Development, died on Saturday, November 17, 2012, in Charlottesville, Virginia. <br>
He was born at The Presidio, California, on February 21, 1916, to Colonel Leartus J. Owen , MD, and Ethel Christine Rogers Owen . The son of a career Army surgeon, Jack as a boy moved with his family around the country, including Hawaii. In 1932, the family settled on a farm in Charlottesville, Virginia. Jack attended the Episcopal High School in Alexandria and the University of Virginia, where he graduated with honors from the Engineering School in 1939. He was bicycling in Europe with his brother, David, when World War II ignited. Upon returning home Jack entered the engineering training program with Westinghouse Electric in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. In January, 1941, before the United States entered the war, he enlisted in the Army as a private, and reported to Aberdeen Proving Ground. After completing Officer Candidate School, he became an ordnance officer on General Omar Bradley's staff and served in England and Europe. In recognition of his meritorious service during and after the war, he received the Bronze Star and was made a Knight of the Order of the Oaken Wreath of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg. He was discharged as a Major in 1946. Jack returned to Charlottesville to support his ailing father and worked as an engineer at the Institute for Textile Technology from 1946 until 1950. At the outbreak of the Korean War, the Army recalled him to work at the Pentagon. In 1951, Jack married Helen (Apple) Bissell Dobie, and they moved with Apple's two young daughters to Greenfield, Massachusetts. There, he joined the Millers Falls Tool Company. Over the next decade, he progressed from the engineering department to become company president. In 1966 he left Millers Falls to embark upon the career that would become the passion of the rest of his life. Building upon his 25 years of experience at all levels in the corporate world, Jack turned to the profession of connecting corporate and individual resources to the needs of schools and colleges. In 1966, Frank Boyden, the headmaster of Deerfield Academy, invited Jack to conduct a capital campaign which he successfully completed in 1968. Then he joined Yale University to serve as Director of Corporate Relations from 1969 until 1971. Next, Jack moved to the University of Connecticut Foundation from 1971 until 1975, where he continued to interest private corporations in the support of academic excellence, but now in the context of public higher education. With this solid preparation, Jack, a third-generation University of Virginia graduate, accepted University of Virginia President Frank Hereford's invitation to serve as the University's first Vice President for Development from 1976 until 1981. Under his direction, the University launched and successfully completed its initial University-wide capital campaign. After mandatory retirement in 1981, Jack remained as a consultant in the development office until fully retiring at age 70 in 1986. In the years following, Jack continued to connect donors to various projects at the University of Virginia, and received the Raven Award for these efforts in 1994. His last major project was to secure funding for the digital archiving of the glass plate negatives of Rufus Holsinger, a Charlottesville photographer of the early 20th century. Jack was a member of the Raven Society, the IMP Society, and the Seven Society. In addition to supporting the University of Virginia, Jack pursued landscape design, woodworking, and the craft of Nantucket basket weaving. His gifts for designing, building and repairing almost anything (life size hobby horses, fountains, the University of Virginia ceremonial mace) brought him much praise and scant repose. He and Apple delighted in entertaining, travelling, and creating a summer camp for their grandchildren. When Apple fell ill with leukemia, Jack was her tireless and loving caregiver until her death in 1996. He was active throughout his 80's, and remained in his home until he moved to Martha Jefferson House, Charlottesville, at age 93. Jack's life was a living history book for his family. All ages loved hearing stories of the many events he witnessed first-hand, from his visit to the first traffic light in Boston, to bringing the cream into Charlottesville with horse and wagon, to his crossing the beaches of Normandy after D-Day. He exuded Southern charm and delighted in making friends and connections across many walks of life and cultures. His family wishes to express their gratitude to his Charlottesville neighbors over 36 years, to the Martha Jefferson House staff, and to the Hospice of the Piedmont. We are also grateful to his physician, Joyce Geilker, his friend, James Winkey, and his final caregiver, Arlene Harvey. Jack is survived by his children, Julia Rea and her husband, Samuel, of Arlington, Virginia; Elizabeth Rogerson and her husband, Edward, of Milton, Massachusetts; Christina Stahl and her husband, Gary, of New York, New York; and Charles Owen and his wife, Deborah, of Charlottesville, Virginia; and his sister-in-law, Eleanor A. Owen of Towson, Maryland. He is also survived by his seven grandchildren, Alice Rogerson, Catherine R. Hogan, Julia P. Owen , John J. Owen , Carter B. Owen , Peter D. Owen , and Stephanie H. Owen ; and by his great-grandaughter, Hadley E. Rogerson-Leach. <br>
In addition to his wife "Apple", Jack was predeceased by his brother, David R. Owen ; and his son, John D. Owen . A memorial service for family and friends will be held at 1 o'clock on Saturday, December 15, 2012, at the University of Virginia Chapel in Charlottesville. Interment will be private. Gifts may be sent to the Owen Family Fund at the University of Virginia, c/o The UVA Fund, P.O. Box 400314, Charlottesville, VA 22907-4314.<br>
